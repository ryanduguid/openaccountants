## Section 2 -- Who Must Have YEL Insurance

### 2.1 Mandatory

YEL insurance is mandatory if ALL of the following apply:

| Condition | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Age | 18 -- 69 years |
| Self-employment | Working as a sole trader (toiminimi), freelancer, or partner in a general/limited partnership with >30% ownership |
| Duration | Self-employment has continued or is expected to continue for at least 4 months |
| YEL income | Estimated work input value ≥€9,208.43/year (2025) |
| Residence | Working in Finland |

### 2.2 Not Required

| Situation | Reason |
|---|---|
| Annual work input value <€9,208.43 | Below mandatory threshold |
| Self-employment <4 months | Too short |
| Under 18 or over 69 | Outside age range |
| Light entrepreneurship (laskutuspalvelu) | May be considered employment -- depends on status |

### 2.3 Must Arrange Within

YEL insurance must be taken out within **6 months** of starting self-employment. Insurance is retroactive to the start date. Failure to arrange YEL results in Eläketurvakeskus (Finnish Centre for Pensions) arranging it compulsorily + a penalty surcharge.

---

## Section 3 -- YEL Income (Työtulo)

### 3.1 Definition

YEL income (vahvistettu työtulo) is the estimated monetary value of the self-employed person's annual work input -- equivalent to what you would pay a similarly skilled employee to do the same work.

YEL income is NOT:
- Actual business revenue
- Net profit
- Taxable income

### 3.2 Setting YEL Income

| Factor | Consideration |
|---|---|
| Industry | Average salary for the sector |
| Hours | Full-time vs part-time |
| Skill level | Professional qualifications |
| Turnover | Indicative but not determinative |

Since 2023, pension providers use a standardised YEL income calculation service based on field of business and turnover, providing a recommended level (±30% range).

### 3.3 YEL Income Reviews

Under the 2023 YEL reform:

- Pension providers review YEL income every 3 years
- Maximum increase per review: €4,000
- From 2026, this cap applies to all insured (including those who started in 2023-2025)
- Self-employed can proactively adjust YEL income at any time via their pension provider

---

## Section 4 -- Contribution Calculation

### 4.1 Formula

```
Annual YEL contribution = Confirmed YEL income × Contribution rate
```

### 4.2 Examples (2025)

| Scenario | YEL Income | Age | Rate | Annual Contribution | Monthly Equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum, standard | €9,208.43 | 35 | 24.10% | €2,219.23 | €184.94 |
| Minimum, new entrepreneur | €9,208.43 | 35 | 18.798% | €1,731.03 | €144.25 |
| Median | €28,000 | 40 | 24.10% | €6,748.00 | €562.33 |
| Median, new entrepreneur | €28,000 | 40 | 18.798% | €5,263.44 | €438.62 |
| Unemployment threshold | €15,128 | 30 | 24.10% | €3,645.85 | €303.82 |
| Higher income | €60,000 | 55 | 25.60% | €15,360.00 | €1,280.00 |

### 4.3 Flexible Contributions

Self-employed can temporarily adjust contributions:

| Direction | Range | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Increase | Up to +100% of standard contribution | Increases pension accrual for that year |
| Decrease | Down to -20% of standard contribution | Reduces pension accrual; stricter conditions |
| Duration | One year at a time | Must notify pension provider |
| Effect on YEL income | None -- confirmed income stays the same | Only affects actual contribution paid |

---

## Section 5 -- Tax Treatment

### 5.1 Deductibility

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| YEL contributions paid by self-employed person | Fully deductible from personal income taxation |
| Deduction location | Personal tax return (not business income deduction) |
| Can be allocated to spouse | Yes, if both agree -- can be deducted from either spouse's income |
| Effect on business income | Reduces total taxable income; does NOT reduce business net profit |

### 5.2 Important Distinction

YEL contributions are deducted from the self-employed person's personal taxes, not from business profits. They appear on the personal tax return, not the income statement (tuloslaskelma) of the business.

---

## Section 6 -- Benefits Linked to YEL Income

YEL income determines the basis for multiple social security benefits:

| Benefit | Link to YEL Income |
|---|---|
| Old-age pension (vanhuuseläke) | Pension accrues at 1.5% of YEL income per year |
| Disability pension (työkyvyttömyyseläke) | Based on YEL income history |
| Sickness daily allowance (sairauspäiväraha) | Kela calculates from YEL income |
| Parental allowance (vanhempainpäiväraha) | Kela calculates from YEL income |
| Unemployment allowance | Requires YEL income ≥€15,128/year (2025) + membership in Entrepreneur Fund |
| Workers' compensation (if voluntary) | Must be at least YEL income level |

### 6.1 Pension Accrual

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Accrual rate | 1.5% of confirmed YEL income per year (all ages, from 2017) |
| Retirement age | Graduated by birth year; approximately 65-66 for those born in the 1970s-1980s |

### 6.2 Sickness Allowance

- Waiting period: onset day + 9 following working days (self-employed)
- Amount: calculated from YEL income
- Low YEL income = low sickness allowance
- Minimum daily allowance from Kela if no YEL or very low YEL

---

## Section 7 -- Provider Selection

### 7.1 Choosing a Pension Company

Self-employed persons choose their own YEL provider from authorised pension insurance companies:

| Provider | Website |
|---|---|
| Varma | varma.fi |
| Ilmarinen | ilmarinen.fi |
| Elo | elo.fi |
| Veritas | veritas.fi |

### 7.2 Key Facts

- Contribution rates are identical across all providers (set by law)
- YEL income confirmation uses the same calculation service
- Providers differ in customer service, digital tools, and investment returns
- Self-employed can transfer YEL insurance between providers (with notice period)
- No cost to switch providers

---

## Section 8 -- Payment

### 8.1 Payment Schedule

| Option | Detail |
|---|---|
| Monthly | Due on a date chosen by the insured |
| Every 2 months | Alternative schedule |
| Every 3 months | Alternative schedule |
| Every 6 months | Alternative schedule |
| Annually | Lump sum |

### 8.2 Late Payment

| Situation | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Late payment | Interest at prescribed rate (2.65% in 2025) |
| Persistent non-payment | Pension company may terminate insurance; Eläketurvakeskus arranges compulsory insurance |
| Compulsory insurance | Penalty surcharge applies (up to 50% increase) |

---

## Section 9 -- Compulsory Arrangement by Eläketurvakeskus

If a self-employed person fails to arrange mandatory YEL insurance:

1. Eläketurvakeskus (ETK) sends a notice requiring insurance
2. If not arranged within the given time, ETK takes out insurance on behalf of the person
3. Compulsory insurance is retroactive to the start of self-employment
4. A **negligence increase** of up to 50% is added to the contribution
5. No new entrepreneur discount is available for compulsory insurance

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|---|---|
| TyEL (employees' pension) | If self-employed person also has employment, TyEL and YEL run in parallel; both accrue pension |
| Kela benefits | YEL income is the basis for sickness, parental, and rehabilitation allowances |
| Income tax | YEL contributions are deductible; see **fi-income-tax** skill |
| Unemployment | YEL income ≥€15,128 + Entrepreneur Fund membership required for earnings-related unemployment allowance |

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER advise setting YEL income at minimum to "save money" without explaining the consequences for pension, sickness allowance, and unemployment benefits
- NEVER treat YEL contributions as a business expense -- they are a personal tax deduction
- NEVER ignore the 6-month deadline for arranging YEL insurance
- NEVER assume light entrepreneurs (laskutuspalvelu users) are exempt -- status depends on actual work arrangement
- NEVER present YEL income as equivalent to business revenue or profit
- NEVER advise on TyEL (employee pension) matters -- different system
