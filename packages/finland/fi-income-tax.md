### Earned Income -- State Tax Brackets (2025)

| Taxable Earned Income (EUR) | Tax at Lower Limit | Rate on Excess |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 21,200 | €0 | 12.64% |
| 21,200 -- 31,500 | €2,679.68 | 19.00% |
| 31,500 -- 52,100 | €4,636.68 | 30.25% |

| 150,000+ | €48,943.68 | 44.25% |

The top bracket (44.25%) includes a 2 percentage point "solidarity tax" (solidaarisuusvero) on income above €150,000.

### Municipal Tax (kunnallisvero)

Flat rate set by each municipality. Range: 4.73% -- 10.86% (mainland Finland 2025). Average approximately 7.5%. Applied to taxable earned income after municipal deductions (which differ from state deductions).

### Church Tax (kirkollisvero)

Applicable only to members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church or Orthodox Church. Range: approximately 1.0% -- 2.2% depending on parish.

### Capital Income Tax (pääomatulovero)

| Capital Income (EUR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 30,000 | 30% |
| 30,000+ | 34% |

### Health Insurance Contributions (2025)

| Component | Rate | Applies To |
|---|---|---|
| Medical care contribution | 0.51% | All earned income |
| Daily allowance contribution (employee) | 0.88% | Earned income ≥€17,255/year |
| Daily allowance contribution (self-employed) | 1.11% | Earned income ≥€17,255/year |
| Daily allowance (self-employed, low income) | 0.23% | Earned income <€17,255/year |

### Self-Employed Business Income Split

For self-employed (sole traders / toiminimiyrittäjä), business income is split between earned income and capital income:

- **Capital income portion:** 20% of the net assets of the business at the end of the prior year (default). The taxpayer may elect 10% or 0% instead.
- **Earned income portion:** The remainder is taxed as earned income at progressive rates plus municipal tax.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown municipality | STOP -- municipal tax rate required |
| Unknown church membership | No church tax |
| Unknown capital income split election | 20% of net assets (statutory default) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT registration | Assume not VAT-registered |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year, municipality of residence, and confirmation of whether self-employed (elinkeinonharjoittaja) or freelancer (ammatinharjoittaja).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, YEL pension insurance payment confirmations, prior year OmaVero tax decision, asset register for business.

**Ideal** -- complete bookkeeping (single-entry or double-entry), balance sheet if double-entry, prepayment tax (ennakkovero) payment confirmations, travel expense records.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-FI-1 -- Municipality unknown.** "Municipal tax rate varies from 4.73% to 10.86%. Cannot compute total tax without knowing the client's municipality. Please confirm."

**R-FI-2 -- Company or partnership.** "This skill covers sole traders (toiminimi) and freelancers (ammatinharjoittaja) only. Oy (osakeyhtiö), Ky (kommandiittiyhtiö), and Ay (avoin yhtiö) have different rules. Escalate to a Finnish tax adviser."

**R-FI-3 -- Non-resident taxation.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation has separate rules (e.g., flat 35% withholding on employment income). Out of scope."

**R-FI-4 -- International income / tax treaty.** "Cross-border income subject to Finland's extensive double tax treaty network requires specialist analysis. Escalate."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Freelance Developer, Single, Helsinki

**Input:** Gross business revenue €65,000, allowable expenses €12,000, net business income €53,000. No significant business assets. Municipality: Helsinki (municipal tax 8.50% for 2025). Church member (Evangelical Lutheran, church tax ~1.0%).

**Capital income split:** Net business assets ~€5,000. Capital income = 20% × €5,000 = €1,000 at 30% = €300. Earned income = €53,000 - €1,000 = €52,000.

**State tax on €52,000 earned income:**
Tax at €31,500 limit = €4,636.68
Excess: (€52,000 - €31,500) × 30.25% = €6,201.25
State tax = €10,837.93

**Municipal tax on €52,000:** €52,000 × 8.50% = €4,420 (before municipal deductions; actual will be lower after perusvähennys and other deductions).

**Health insurance:** ~€52,000 × (0.51% + 1.11%) = ~€842.

**Capital income tax:** €1,000 × 30% = €300.

**Approximate total tax:** ~€15,000--€16,000 (effective rate ~28-30%).

### Example 2 -- Capital Income Only

**Input:** Investment income €45,000 (dividends, rental, interest).

**Tax:** First €30,000 at 30% = €9,000. Remaining €15,000 at 34% = €5,100. Total = €14,100.

- NEVER ignore the earned income / capital income split for self-employed
- NEVER apply employee-specific deductions (e.g., commuting deduction) to self-employed income
- NEVER treat YEL insurance as a business expense -- it is a personal tax deduction
- NEVER treat prepayment tax (ennakkovero) as an expense -- it is a credit against final tax
- NEVER present calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
- NEVER advise on non-resident, dual-resident, or cross-border tax situations
