### Core Principle

The CRA treats cryptocurrency as a **commodity** (not currency). Dispositions result in either a capital gain or business income depending on the taxpayer's circumstances.

### Capital Gains Inclusion Rate (2025)

| Taxpayer | Inclusion Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Individuals -- first $250,000 of net capital gains | 50% | Standard inclusion |
| Individuals -- gains above $250,000 | 66.67% | Effective for dispositions after 24 June 2024 |
| Corporations and trusts | 66.67% on all gains | No $250K threshold |

**Important:** The increase to 66.67% above $250K was announced in Budget 2024 and received Royal Assent. Verify current enforcement status as implementation details evolved through 2024-2025.

### Federal Tax Rates (2025)

| Taxable Income (CAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 57,375 | 15% |
| 57,376 -- 114,750 | 20.5% |
| 114,751 -- 158,468 | 26% |
| 158,469 -- 220,000 | 29% |
| 220,001+ | 33% |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether capital or business income | Treat as capital gains (lower inclusion) until evidence of business activity |
| Unknown ACB | $0 (maximum gain) -- obtain records |
| Unknown acquisition date | No holding period benefit claimed |
| Unknown fair market value at acquisition | Use reputable exchange rate at date/time |

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Capital Gains vs Business Income

| Factor | Capital (Investor) | Business Income (Trader) |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency of transactions | Occasional | High volume, systematic |
| Holding period | Extended (weeks/months/years) | Very short (minutes/hours/days) |
| Knowledge/expertise | General interest | Deep market knowledge, technical analysis |
| Time devoted | Part-time/casual | Significant daily commitment |
| Financing | Own capital | Leveraged/borrowed funds |
| Advertising/promotion | None | May promote activity |
| Nature of assets | Long-term hold for appreciation | Quick turnover for profit |
| Tax treatment | 50% (or 66.67%) inclusion | 100% income (fully taxable) |
| Loss treatment | Capital losses (only offset gains) | Business losses (offset all income) |

The CRA applies a holistic test. No single factor is determinative.

### 2.2 Disposition Events

A disposition occurs when:

| Event | Disposition? |
|---|---|
| Sell crypto for CAD (or fiat) | Yes |
| Trade crypto for another crypto | Yes -- barter transaction |
| Use crypto to purchase goods/services | Yes -- at FMV |
| Gift crypto | Yes -- deemed disposition at FMV |
| Donate crypto to registered charity | Yes -- but donation receipt at FMV; no capital gain if donated to qualified donee (proposed) |
| Transfer between own wallets | No -- same beneficial owner |
| Death of taxpayer | Yes -- deemed disposition at FMV |

### 2.3 Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) Tracking

The ACB is calculated using the **weighted average cost method** (mandatory for identical properties under ITA s. 47):

ACB per unit = Total cost of all units acquired ÷ Total units held

| Element Included in ACB | Example |
|---|---|
| Purchase price in CAD | Amount paid on exchange |
| Transaction/exchange fees on purchase | Coinbase fee, spread cost |
| Transfer fees (incoming) | Network/gas fees to acquire |

When a partial disposition occurs:
- Proceeds of disposition = FMV in CAD at time of sale
- ACB of disposed units = (Total ACB ÷ total units) × units sold
- Capital gain/loss = Proceeds − ACB of disposed units − disposition costs

### 2.4 Superficial Loss Rule (ITA s. 40(2)(g)(i))

If you sell crypto at a loss and repurchase the same crypto (or identical property) within 30 days before or after the sale (or your affiliated person acquires it), the loss is **denied**. The denied loss is added to the ACB of the repurchased property.

### 2.5 Staking Rewards

| Treatment | Detail |
|---|---|
| CRA position | Business income or property income (assessable when received) |
| Amount | FMV in CAD at date/time of receipt |
| ACB of received tokens | FMV at receipt (becomes cost base for future disposition) |
| If part of active business | Report on T2125 (business income) |
| If passive/property income | Report as other income (Line 13000) |

### 2.6 Mining

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Hobby mining (small-scale, no profit intent) | Acquired at $0 ACB; CGT on disposition |
| Business mining (significant operations) | Business income at FMV when mined; expenses deductible; GST/HST registrant obligations |

### 2.7 Airdrops and Hard Forks

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop (no consideration given) | CRA: income at FMV if received for services or as reward; otherwise $0 ACB |
| Hard fork (new token from existing chain) | $0 ACB; taxable on disposition |
| Airdrop requiring action (governance, claim) | Income at FMV if value exists |

### 2.8 GST/HST on Crypto

| Transaction | GST/HST Implication |
|---|---|
| Purchasing crypto with fiat | No GST/HST (financial instrument) |
| Selling crypto for fiat | No GST/HST |
| Using crypto to purchase taxable goods/services | GST/HST applies to the goods/services (crypto is consideration) |
| Mining/staking as business -- selling mined crypto | Exempt financial service (no GST/HST on sale of crypto itself) |
| Mining/staking as business -- input costs | ITC may be restricted (financial services supplier rules) |
| Crypto exchange services (platform fees) | Subject to GST/HST as a taxable supply |

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

### 3.1 Common Exchange Patterns (Canadian Exchanges)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NEWTON BUY / SHAKEPAY BUY | Acquisition | ACB = CAD paid + spread (no explicit fee on some platforms) |
| BITBUY PURCHASE / COINSMART BUY | Acquisition | ACB = CAD paid + any trading fee |
| KRAKEN BUY (CAD pair) | Acquisition | ACB = CAD equivalent + fee |
| WEALTHSIMPLE CRYPTO BUY | Acquisition | ACB = CAD paid + spread |
| SELL ORDER (any exchange) | Disposition | Proceeds = CAD received |
| CONVERT / SWAP / TRADE | Disposition + acquisition | Two legs: dispose of A, acquire B |
| CAD WITHDRAWAL | Not taxable | Already sold |
| CAD DEPOSIT | Not taxable | Funding account |

### 3.2 Income Events

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| STAKING REWARD | Income (business or property) | FMV at receipt |
| MINING PAYOUT | Income (if business) or $0 ACB (if hobby) | Determine mining scale |
| REFERRAL BONUS (crypto) | Income | FMV at receipt |
| EARN / LENDING INTEREST | Income (property income) | FMV at receipt |
| CASHBACK REWARD (crypto) | Income | FMV at receipt |

### 3.3 Non-Taxable Movements

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TRANSFER TO COLD WALLET | No tax event | Same beneficial owner |
| TRANSFER BETWEEN EXCHANGES | No tax event | Network fees add to ACB or deductible expense |
| FIAT DEPOSIT / WITHDRAWAL | No tax event | Cash movement |

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Classify Activity
Determine if taxpayer is investor (capital gains) or trader (business income).

### Step 2: Build ACB Ledger
Track every acquisition: weighted average cost across all units of each crypto.

### Step 3: Calculate Gain/Loss per Disposition
Proceeds (CAD FMV) − ACB of disposed units − selling costs = gain or loss.

### Step 4: Check Superficial Loss Rule
Deny any loss where same crypto was reacquired within 30-day window.

### Step 5: Apply Inclusion Rate
- Capital gains: 50% on first $250K; 66.67% on excess (individuals)
- Business income: 100% taxable

### Step 6: Report Staking/Mining/Airdrop Income
Separately from capital gains -- as business or property income.

### Step 7: File
- Capital gains: Schedule 3
- Business income: T2125 (Statement of Business Activities)
- Other income: Line 13000

## Section 5 -- Record-Keeping Requirements

CRA requires:

| Record | Mandatory |
|---|---|
| Date and time of each transaction | Yes |
| Type of transaction (buy/sell/trade/transfer) | Yes |
| Amount of crypto involved | Yes |
| FMV in CAD at time of transaction | Yes |
| Exchange or platform used | Yes |
| Wallet addresses involved | Yes |
| Running ACB calculation | Yes |
| Purpose of transaction | Yes |

Retention: 6 years from the end of the tax year to which they relate.

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps
Each swap is a barter transaction. The disposition of crypto A is at the FMV of crypto B received (or FMV of A given up, whichever is more readily determinable). Must calculate gain/loss on A and establish ACB for B.

### 6.2 DeFi Lending
Lending crypto to a DeFi protocol may be a disposition (if legal ownership transfers to the protocol). Conservative treatment: disposition at FMV when deposited, reacquisition when withdrawn. Interest/yield received is property income.

### 6.3 NFTs
Treated the same as other crypto assets. Acquisition = ACB. Sale = disposition. If creating NFTs as a business, profits are business income.

### 6.4 Wrapped Tokens
Wrapping (e.g., ETH → WETH) is a grey area. Conservative treatment: disposition of ETH, acquisition of WETH at same FMV. No gain/loss but must track separately.

### 6.5 Emigration from Canada
Deemed disposition of all crypto at FMV on departure date (ITA s. 128.1). Capital gains tax applies on departure.

### 6.6 Death
Deemed disposition at FMV immediately before death. Capital gains included in terminal return. Beneficiary acquires at FMV as their ACB.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the 50% inclusion rate to all gains without checking the $250,000 threshold
- NEVER use specific identification method for identical properties -- CRA requires weighted average (ITA s. 47)
- NEVER ignore the superficial loss rule for repurchases within 30 days
- NEVER treat crypto-to-crypto swaps as non-events -- each swap is a disposition
- NEVER claim business losses without substantiating that the activity is a business (not capital)
- NEVER ignore GST/HST obligations for crypto businesses
- NEVER assume airdrops are always tax-free -- determine if income character exists
- NEVER omit staking/mining income -- it is taxable when received
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
