## Section 2 -- Documentation Requirements

| Threshold | Aggregate transactions > CAD 1 million with any single non-resident related party |
| Timing | Must be prepared or obtained by the "documentation-due date" (tax return filing deadline) |

| Provision to CRA | Within 3 months of written request (reducing to 30 days for years beginning after 4 Nov 2025) |

### 2.2 Form T106 -- Information Return

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Required? | Yes, if total non-arm's length transactions with non-residents > CAD 1 million in tax year |
| Filing deadline | 6 months after end of taxation year (aligns with corporate tax return) |
| Content | Summary of all non-arm's length transactions by non-resident party |

### 2.3 Master File / Local File

Canada does not formally mandate OECD-style Master File / Local File (no separate filing). However, the 2025 draft legislation introduces enhanced documentation aligning with OECD standards for years beginning after November 4, 2025.

### 2.4 Country-by-Country Report (Form RC4649)

## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

### 3.1 Definition

Section 247(2) ITA: Where terms/conditions between a taxpayer and a non-arm's length non-resident differ from those that would have been made between arm's length parties, adjustments are made to reflect arm's length conditions.

### 3.2 Accepted Methods

| Method | Accepted |
|---|---|

| Cost Plus Method (CPM) | Yes |

### 3.3 Preferred Method

No statutory hierarchy. CRA accepts most appropriate method per OECD Guidelines. IC 87-2R provides administrative guidance.

### 3.4 Recharacterization Power

Section 247(2)(b)(c)(d): CRA can recharacterize transactions if they would not have been entered into at all between arm's length parties (not just reprice them).

| Interest rates | No safe harbour; market benchmarking required (thin cap rules separate) |

### 8.1 Practical Risk Assessment

CRA uses a risk-based approach to TP audits, focusing on:
- Large/complex transactions with high-risk jurisdictions
- Transactions involving intangibles and cost-sharing arrangements
- Financial transactions (intercompany loans, guarantees)
- Entities with thin capitalisation concerns
- Losses sustained over multiple years in Canada

### 8.2 2025 Simplified Documentation

Draft legislation for taxation years beginning after November 4, 2025 introduces:
- Simplified contemporaneous documentation for taxpayers meeting prescribed conditions
- Conditions and scope still being finalized through consultation
- Intended to reduce compliance burden for lower-risk transactions
