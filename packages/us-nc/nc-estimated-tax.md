## Section 2: Quick reference

### The four quarterly due dates (TY 2025 calendar-year filers)

| Installment | Period covered | Due date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31, 2025 | April 15, 2025 |
| Q2 | Apr 1 – May 31, 2025 | June 15, 2025 |
| Q3 | Jun 1 – Aug 31, 2025 | September 15, 2025 |
| Q4 | Sep 1 – Dec 31, 2025 | January 15, 2026 |

> **Jan 31 exception.** The January 15 (Q4) payment may be skipped if the
> full Form D-400 return is filed and the entire balance is paid by
> **January 31, 2026**. Source: NCDOR Estimated Income Tax page; G.S. § 105-163.15(d).

### Threshold to require quarterly estimates

You must make NC estimated tax payments if the tax shown due on your return,
**reduced by NC withholding and allowable tax credits, is $1,000 or more**.
This applies regardless of how much of your income is non-wage. Source: NCDOR
NC-40 Instructions; G.S. § 105-163.15(a).

`[VERIFY:]` Some commentary suggests NC may treat the threshold as lower in
specific transitional years. Current NCDOR guidance for 2025 and 2026
explicitly uses $1,000.

### Safe harbor (no underpayment interest)

Combined withholding plus timely estimated payments must equal **at least
the smaller of:**

1. **90% of current-year tax**, OR
2. **100% of prior-year tax** (prior year must cover a full 12 months), OR
3. **110% of prior-year tax** if **prior-year NC AGI > $150,000**
   ($75,000 if MFS).

Source: NCDOR NC-40 Instructions; G.S. § 105-163.15(c). `[VERIFY:]` Confirm
the 110% high-income variant remains in effect for TY 2025 — NCDOR mirrors
the federal § 6654 structure, and the LegalClarity summary explicitly
confirms the $150,000/$75,000 thresholds, but the statute text should be
read alongside any annual NCDOR memo.

### Flat tax rates (use for projecting current-year liability)

| Tax year | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 | 4.50% | Session Law 2023-134 |
| 2025 | 4.25% | Session Law 2023-134 |
| 2026 | 3.99% | Session Law 2023-134 |
| 2027 | 3.49% (triggered) | Session Law 2023-134; revenue trigger expected to be met |
| 2028+ | Scheduled to 2.99% then ultimately 2.49% by 2030 | `[VERIFY:]` confirm final-year phase-down legislation |

### Current underpayment interest rate

| Period | Annual rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Jul 1 – Dec 31, 2025 | 7% | NCDOR Interest Rate Memo Jul–Dec 2025 |
| Jan 1 – Jun 30, 2026 | 7% | NCDOR Interest Rate Memo Jan–Jun 2026 |

Rate is set by the Secretary of Revenue under G.S. § 105-241.21(a), must
fall between **5% and 16%**, and is published on or before December 1 (for
the following Jan–Jun period) and June 1 (for the following Jul–Dec period).

### Payment methods

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| NCDOR e-Services (online) | https://eservices.dor.nc.gov — free; bank draft (eCheck) or credit card (convenience fee applies) |
| Paper check + NC-40 voucher | Mail to NCDOR, PO Box 25000, Raleigh, NC 27640-0630 |
| Approved tax software | TurboTax, Drake, ProSeries, etc. — submits via NCDOR API |

## Section 3: Threshold determination — when MUST you make estimates

### The $1,000 test

A NC resident individual is **required** to make estimated tax payments if
**all** of the following are true:

1. Expected NC tax liability for the year minus expected NC withholding and
   allowable credits **≥ $1,000**, AND
2. The taxpayer did not satisfy the prior-year safe harbor through
   withholding alone.

### Decision tree

```
Step 1: Project current-year NC tax
        = (Federal AGI ± NC modifications − NC std/itemized − child deduction) × rate

Step 2: Subtract projected NC withholding (W-2 Box 17, 1099-NEC NC withhold)

Step 3: Subtract projected NC credits (D-400TC)

Step 4: Is result ≥ $1,000?
        - NO  → No estimates required. Underpayment penalty cannot apply (G.S. § 105-163.15(e)).
        - YES → Continue to Step 5.

Step 5: Does prior-year withholding alone ≥ prior-year tax (× 110% if AGI > $150k)?
        - YES → No estimates required; safe harbor met by withholding alone.
        - NO  → Estimates required. Compute required annual payment (Section 5).
```

### First-year filers

A taxpayer with **no NC return for the immediately preceding tax year**
(e.g., new NC resident, recent graduate) cannot use the prior-year safe
harbor — only the 90% current-year safe harbor is available. `[VERIFY:]`
Confirm NC's first-year carve-out language tracks federal § 6654(d)(1)(B);
the LegalClarity summary characterizes this as a "one-year grace period"
but the statutory effect is that no penalty can compute without a
prior-year benchmark.

### Income types that commonly trigger the threshold

- Schedule C net profit (sole prop / SMLLC disregarded)
- Schedule E partnership K-1 income (NC source)
- S-corp K-1 distributive share
- Rental income net of expenses
- Capital gains (NC taxes at the flat rate, no preferential rate)
- IRA / 401(k) distributions without withholding
- Social Security — **NOT** taxed by NC, so does not increase NC liability
- Marketplace facilitator earnings (1099-K)

---

## Section 4: The safe-harbor calculation

NC's safe harbor mirrors federal § 6654 in structure but uses NC tax
figures throughout.

### The three-prong test (taxpayer satisfies ANY one)

| Prong | Calculation | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Withholding + estimates ≥ 90% × current-year NC tax | All taxpayers |
| **B** | Withholding + estimates ≥ 100% × prior-year NC tax | Prior-year NC AGI ≤ $150,000 (or ≤ $75,000 MFS) |
| **C** | Withholding + estimates ≥ 110% × prior-year NC tax | Prior-year NC AGI > $150,000 (or > $75,000 MFS) |

### Required annual payment (RAP)

```
RAP = smaller of:
      (a) 90% × current-year NC tax (Form D-400, Line 17 after credits, before payments)
      (b) 100% × prior-year NC tax  [or 110% if AGI threshold exceeded]
```

This RAP figure feeds **Form D-422 Part I, Line 8** as the "required annual
payment."

### Worked safe-harbor calc — moderate income

> Taxpayer: NC resident, single, freelance developer.
> Prior-year (2024) NC tax (D-400 Line 17): $7,200. Prior-year NC AGI: $108,000.
> Current-year (2025) projected NC tax: $9,000.

| Prong | Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| A — 90% current year | $9,000 × 0.90 | $8,100 |
| B — 100% prior year | $7,200 × 1.00 | $7,200 |

110% high-income variant does **not** apply ($108k ≤ $150k threshold).
**RAP = lower of $8,100 or $7,200 = $7,200.** Each quarterly installment
under the regular method = $7,200 / 4 = **$1,800**.

### Worked safe-harbor calc — high-income

> Taxpayer: NC resident, MFJ. Prior-year (2024) NC tax: $18,400.
> Prior-year NC AGI: $312,000 (> $150,000 threshold → 110% applies).
> Current-year (2025) projected NC tax: $22,000.

| Prong | Calculation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| A — 90% current year | $22,000 × 0.90 | $19,800 |
| C — 110% prior year | $18,400 × 1.10 | $20,240 |

**RAP = lower of $19,800 or $20,240 = $19,800.** Each quarterly
installment = $19,800 / 4 = **$4,950**.

> **Practical tip.** When the 110% rule applies and current-year income is
> projected to drop, choosing the 90% current-year prong avoids
> over-payment. When current-year income is projected to spike, locking in
> the 110% prior-year prong avoids penalty exposure on growth.

---

## Section 5: Quarterly installment amounts — regular method

### The simple split

Under the regular method, the RAP is divided **equally into four
installments**:

```
Installment = Required Annual Payment ÷ 4
```

Each installment is then reduced by NC withholding **for that period** to
arrive at the cash payment needed by the due date.

### Withholding crediting

NC withholding (from W-2s, NC 1099 withholding, pension withholding) is
treated as **paid evenly across the four installment periods** unless the
taxpayer elects otherwise on Form D-422 (e.g., to assign actual
period-by-period withholding for a year-end bonus). Source: NCDOR D-422
instructions; mirrors federal § 6654(g).

### Worked installment schedule

> Same facts as moderate-income example above. RAP = $7,200. Projected NC
> withholding from a small W-2 = $1,200 (treated as $300/quarter).

| Quarter | Due date | Required installment | Withholding credit | Net NC-40 payment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Apr 15, 2025 | $1,800 | $300 | **$1,500** |
| Q2 | Jun 15, 2025 | $1,800 | $300 | **$1,500** |
| Q3 | Sep 15, 2025 | $1,800 | $300 | **$1,500** |
| Q4 | Jan 15, 2026 | $1,800 | $300 | **$1,500** |
| **Total** | | **$7,200** | **$1,200** | **$6,000** |

---

## Section 6: Annualized income installment method (Form D-422A)

Used when income is **lumpy or seasonal** — large Q3 or Q4 capital gain,
freelance project completion bonus, partnership distribution late in the
year. The annualized method allows the taxpayer to "back-load" payments
into the period when income is actually earned, avoiding penalty on
earlier installments.

### How it works (conceptual)

For each cumulative period (3 months, 5 months, 8 months, 12 months),
compute:

1. Cumulative NC AGI through that period
2. Annualize: multiply by annualization factor (4, 2.4, 1.5, 1.0)
3. Compute NC tax on annualized amount
4. Multiply by applicable percentage (22.5%, 45%, 67.5%, 90%)
5. Subtract prior cumulative installments

Result: the **annualized installment** for that quarter, compared against
the regular installment — the **smaller** of the two is the required
installment for that period (the difference rolls forward to later
quarters).

### Annualization factors and percentages

| Installment | Months in period | Annualization factor | Cumulative % required |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (Apr 15) | 3 (Jan–Mar) | 4.0 | 22.5% |
| 2 (Jun 15) | 5 (Jan–May) | 2.4 | 45.0% |
| 3 (Sep 15) | 8 (Jan–Aug) | 1.5 | 67.5% |
| 4 (Jan 15) | 12 (Jan–Dec) | 1.0 | 90.0% |

Source: Form D-422A Annualized Income Installment Worksheet; mirrors
federal Schedule AI of Form 2210.

### All-or-nothing election

> **If the annualized method is used for any one installment, it MUST be
> used for ALL four installments.** Source: D-422A instructions.

### Worked example — Q3 income spike

> Taxpayer: NC freelance developer. Steady income Jan–Aug ~ $4,000/month.
> Closes a large project September with $80,000 lump sum. NC tax projection
> for full year: $6,500 (steady) + $3,400 (Q3 spike) = $9,900. Prior-year
> NC tax: $7,800. RAP = lower of (90% × $9,900 = $8,910) or ($7,800) =
> **$7,800**.

**Regular method** would require $1,950 per quarter — but the taxpayer
doesn't have the cash in Q1/Q2 because the big income hasn't arrived.

**Annualized method:**

| Period | Cumulative NC AGI | Annualized AGI | Annualized NC tax (4.25%) | × cumulative % | Less prior installments | **This quarter** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 (3 mo) | $12,000 | $48,000 | ~$1,500 (after deductions) | × 22.5% = $338 | — | **$338** |
| Q2 (5 mo) | $20,000 | $48,000 | ~$1,500 | × 45.0% = $675 | − $338 | **$337** |
| Q3 (8 mo) | $112,000 | $168,000 | ~$6,650 | × 67.5% = $4,489 | − $675 | **$3,814** |
| Q4 (12 mo) | $128,000 | $128,000 | ~$4,930 | × 90.0% = $4,437 | − $4,489 | **$0** (or wait — see note) |

> **Note.** The Q4 cumulative requirement ($4,437) can be less than already
> paid ($4,489) when income decelerates after Q3. In that case the Q4
> installment falls to zero. Form D-422 then carries the "excess Q3"
> forward as a credit toward any remaining shortfall — interest on any
> earlier underpayment is still computed period by period.

`[VERIFY:]` These illustrative numbers approximate the mechanics; an actual
return uses D-422A line by line with the precise NC AGI, NC standard
deduction (annualized), and child deduction (annualized). Run the
worksheet against the live taxpayer facts before relying on figures.

## Section 7: Form NC-40 vouchers — line by line

### Voucher anatomy

Form NC-40 is a **single page producing four detachable vouchers** (each
labeled with the installment number and due date). When generated through
NCDOR e-Services, the form is personalized with the taxpayer's SSN, name,
and address.

### Voucher fields

| Field | Description | How to populate |
|---|---|---|
| SSN (primary) | Primary taxpayer Social Security Number | 9 digits, no dashes on voucher |
| SSN (spouse) | If MFJ, second SSN | Required if filing jointly and joint estimate |
| Name(s) | Last name first, then first name(s) | Match D-400 filing |
| Address | NC mailing address | Update on file if moved |
| Installment number | 1, 2, 3, or 4 | One voucher per quarter |
| Amount of payment | Dollars only (round) | Match check / e-payment |
| Tax year | "2025" for TY 2025 vouchers | |

### Generating NC-40

1. Visit https://eservices.dor.nc.gov/vouchers/nc40.jsp
2. Enter name, SSN, and (if joint) spouse SSN
3. Enter amounts and select installment(s)
4. Print PDF — separate vouchers per quarter
5. Mail with check made payable to **N.C. Department of Revenue**
6. Write SSN and "2025 NC-40" on the memo line of the check

### Joint vs. separate filing

- If both spouses anticipate filing **MFJ**, file a joint NC-40 with both
  SSNs and one combined payment per quarter.
- If spouses anticipate filing **MFS**, each must file his/her own NC-40 with
  individual payments.
- If estimated payments were made jointly but the couple ultimately files
  MFS, the joint payments may be allocated between the spouses **in any
  proportion they agree** on each D-400; allocations must reconcile to the
  total paid. Source: NCDOR D-400 Instructions, "Estimated Tax Paid"
  section.

### Extension to file is NOT extension to pay

A federal Form 4868 or NC application for extension extends the **filing**
deadline (D-400 to October 15) but does **NOT** extend the **payment**
deadline. The Q4 installment due January 15 and any balance due April 15
still accrues interest from the original due date. Source: NCDOR
"Extensions" page; G.S. § 105-263.

---

## Section 8: Form D-422 — underpayment penalty mechanics

Form D-422 computes interest on underpayments installment by installment.
It is **filed with Form D-400** when an underpayment exists, OR NCDOR
computes it automatically and bills the taxpayer (in which case D-422 is
not required — but preparing it yourself avoids surprises and is the
default for any return with shortfall).

### Part I — Required Annual Payment (Lines 1–8)

| Line | Description |
|---|---|
| 1 | Current-year NC tax (D-400 Line 17 after credits) |
| 2 | 90% × Line 1 |
| 3 | Prior-year NC tax (full 12 months) |
| 4 | 100% (or 110% if AGI > $150k / $75k MFS) × Line 3 |
| 5 | Smaller of Line 2 or Line 4 |
| 6 | NC withholding (W-2 + 1099 + pension) |
| 7 | Line 5 − Line 6 |
| 8 | **Required annual payment** = Line 7 (if ≥ $1,000) |

> If Line 8 < $1,000, **no penalty applies** and D-422 stops here.

### Part II — Short Method (Lines 9–14)

Available **only if**:
- No estimated payments were made, OR
- All four installments were equal and paid on the regular due dates.

If either condition is true, the taxpayer can compute interest in
aggregate rather than period by period.

### Part III (regular method) — Interest Per Installment

For each of the four installment columns (a, b, c, d corresponding to
4/15, 6/15, 9/15, 1/15):

| Line | Description |
|---|---|
| 15 | Required installment (Line 8 ÷ 4, OR D-422A annualized amount) |
| 16 | Estimated tax + withholding applied to this period |
| 17 | Underpayment (Line 15 − Line 16) |
| 18 | Number of days underpayment outstanding |
| 19 | Interest = Line 17 × annual rate × (Line 18 / 365) |

Total interest = sum of Line 19 across all four columns → carry to D-400
Line 27 (or equivalent line on current-year return) as "Interest on the
underpayment of estimated income tax."

### The "7-day rule" — period-by-period netting

Interest **does NOT net across quarters the way most taxpayers expect**.
An overpayment in Q3 does **NOT** retroactively cure an underpayment in
Q1 — it only stops Q3's clock prospectively. The taxpayer can owe
interest on a Q1 shortfall even if the year-end total paid in equals or
exceeds the RAP.

> `[VERIFY:]` Some practitioner guides describe a 7-day "grace" rule
> derived from the date-counting convention in the D-422 instructions
> (i.e., a payment received within ~7 days of the next installment due
> date is sometimes treated as paid on the next due date for interest-
> tolling purposes). Confirm against the current-year D-422 instructions
> before claiming any such grace in a return.

### Penalty waiver / reasonable cause

NCDOR may waive interest on underpayment of estimated tax in cases of:

- Casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstances making penalty
  inequitable, OR
- Retirement after age 62 or disability during the tax year, OR
- First-year filer with no prior return.

Submit a written waiver request with the return attaching documentation.
Source: G.S. § 105-163.15(e); NCDOR D-422 instructions waiver section.

> NCDOR has **no statutory authority** to abate the underpayment
> interest itself purely on hardship grounds — the waiver is narrow and
> codified.

---

## Section 9: Payment methods — operational detail

### NCDOR e-Services (recommended)

1. Go to https://eservices.dor.nc.gov
2. Select "File and Pay" → "Pay Individual Income Tax" → "Estimated Income Tax (NC-40)"
3. Enter SSN, name, payment amount, tax year, installment number
4. Choose **bank draft** (no fee) or credit/debit card (convenience fee ~2%)
5. Receive confirmation number — **save this** as proof of timely payment

### Paper check + voucher

1. Generate NC-40 PDF (Section 7)
2. Write check payable to **N.C. Department of Revenue**
3. Write SSN, "2025 NC-40," and installment number (1 of 4, etc.) on memo line
4. Mail to:

   ```
   North Carolina Department of Revenue
   PO Box 25000
   Raleigh, NC 27640-0630
   ```

5. **Postmark counts as paid date** for timeliness — use certified mail
   for installments mailed close to the deadline.

### Through tax software

Most major software (TurboTax, Drake, ProSeries, UltraTax, Lacerte) can
submit NC estimated payments via NCDOR's API, generating a confirmation
number. Confirm the payment reflects on the e-Services account after 3–5
business days.

## Section 10: Coordination with federal Form 1040-ES

NC quarterly due dates **mirror federal Form 1040-ES exactly** — April 15,
June 15, September 15, January 15. This permits a single quarterly
workflow:

| Step | Federal | North Carolina |
|---|---|---|
| Project current-year tax | Federal 1040 + Schedule SE | NC D-400 (using federal AGI as start) |
| Compute safe harbor | 90% / 100% (110% > $150k) | 90% / 100% (110% > $150k) |
| Divide RAP | ÷ 4 (regular method) | ÷ 4 (regular method) |
| File voucher | Form 1040-ES voucher | Form NC-40 voucher |
| Pay | IRS Direct Pay / EFTPS | NCDOR e-Services |

### Key differences

| Item | Federal | NC |
|---|---|---|
| Tax structure | Progressive + SE tax | Flat 4.25% (2025) / 3.99% (2026) |
| SE tax | 15.3% via Schedule SE | NC has **no separate SE tax** |
| Capital gains | Preferential 0/15/20% | Taxed at flat rate (no preference) |
| Underpayment form | Form 2210 | Form D-422 |
| Annualized worksheet | Schedule AI of Form 2210 | Form D-422A |
| Interest rate (Jan–Jun 2026) | Federal short-term + 3% (≈ 8% currently) | 7% NC |
| Jan 31 file-and-pay exception | Available | Available |

### Practical tip

When a taxpayer files MFJ federally and MFJ NC, send **one combined
quarterly worksheet** to the client. Show federal estimate, NC estimate,
both due dates, both payment links, and store federal and NC confirmation
numbers side by side.

## Section 12: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Situation | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| NC-EST-T2-01 | **Income spike in mid-year (Q3/Q4)** | Run both regular and annualized methods on D-422A. Annualized often produces lower or zero installments in Q1/Q2 with most payment owed in Q3/Q4. |
| NC-EST-T2-02 | **Change in filing status mid-year (divorce, marriage)** | Prior-year safe harbor uses the prior-year return as filed. Spouses who divorced mid-year should allocate prior-year tax in proportion to separate tax liabilities had they filed separately — judgment required. |
| NC-EST-T2-03 | **Large one-time gain (sale of business, real estate)** | Consider annualized method for the quarter of sale. Project full-year liability including the gain to test whether the 90% current-year safe harbor still beats prior-year. |
| NC-EST-T2-04 | **Move to NC mid-year** | Cannot use NC prior-year safe harbor (no NC return last year). Only the 90% current-year prong is available. Build cumulative income from NC residency start date. |
| NC-EST-T2-05 | **Federal return amended after Q1 NC-40 paid** | If federal AGI changes, NC AGI changes too. Adjust later quarterly NC-40 payments to track new full-year projection; an over-paid Q1 cannot be refunded mid-year but applies to year-end. |
| NC-EST-T2-06 | **PTET election by partnership / S-corp** | If the entity elected NC PTET, the owner's share of NC tax paid by the entity reduces the owner's NC liability — may eliminate the owner's need for personal estimates. Confirm entity actually paid PTET timely. |
| NC-EST-T2-07 | **Retirement during year (age 62+)** | Penalty waiver may apply under G.S. § 105-163.15(e) for the year of retirement and the following year. File written waiver request. |
| NC-EST-T2-08 | **Bonus / withholding adjustment via W-4** | Increasing withholding late in the year is treated as paid **evenly across all four periods** by default — this can retroactively cure earlier underpayments. Useful tool when an underpayment is identified late. |

## Section 13: Worked examples

### Example 1 — Steady-income NC freelancer ($150k expected)

> **Taxpayer:** Single, full-year NC resident, freelance graphic designer.
> Projected 2025 NC AGI: $150,000. No W-2 withholding. No NC credits.
> Prior-year (2024) NC tax: $5,800. Prior-year NC AGI: $138,000.

**Step 1 — Project 2025 NC tax:**
- Federal AGI proxy ≈ NC AGI = $150,000
- NC standard deduction (single) = $12,750
- NC taxable income = $137,250
- NC tax = $137,250 × 4.25% = **$5,833**

**Step 2 — Safe harbor:**
- 90% current year = $5,833 × 0.90 = $5,250
- 100% prior year = $5,800 (110% rule does not apply — prior AGI $138k ≤ $150k)
- **RAP = lower = $5,250**

**Step 3 — Test threshold:** $5,833 expected tax, zero withholding,
shortfall $5,833 ≥ $1,000 → estimates **required**.

**Step 4 — Installments:**

| Q | Due | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Apr 15, 2025 | $1,313 |
| 2 | Jun 15, 2025 | $1,313 |
| 3 | Sep 15, 2025 | $1,313 |
| 4 | Jan 15, 2026 | $1,311 |
| **Total** | | **$5,250** |

**Step 5 — Year-end:** If actual 2025 NC tax is $5,833 and $5,250 was paid
in estimates, balance due with D-400 = $583 by April 15, 2026. Safe harbor
met → **no D-422 interest**.

---

### Example 2 — Self-employed with Q3 income spike (annualized method)

> **Taxpayer:** Single, NC resident, software consultant. Steady income
> $5,000/month Jan–Aug. Closes a $90,000 platform deal in September. Final
> 2025 NC AGI = $130,000. Prior-year NC tax: $4,400.

**Projected NC tax:**
- NC AGI $130,000 − $12,750 std ded = $117,250 taxable
- Tax = $117,250 × 4.25% = **$4,983**

**Safe harbor:** lower of (90% × $4,983 = $4,485) or ($4,400) = **$4,400**.

**Regular method** = $1,100 per quarter — but the taxpayer doesn't have
cash to pay $1,100 in Q1 and Q2 against ~$10,000 of cumulative income.

**Annualized method (D-422A) by period:**

| Period | Cum NC AGI | Annualized | Annual NC tax (after std ded) | × cum % | Less prior | **This Q** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 (3 mo) | $15,000 | $60,000 | $2,009 | × 22.5% = $452 | — | **$452** |
| Q2 (5 mo) | $25,000 | $60,000 | $2,009 | × 45.0% = $904 | − $452 | **$452** |
| Q3 (8 mo) | $130,000 | $195,000 | $7,744 | × 67.5% = $5,227 | − $904 | **$4,323** (capped at RAP balance) |
| Q4 (12 mo) | $130,000 | $130,000 | $4,983 | × 90.0% = $4,485 | − $4,485 already paid | **$0** |

`[VERIFY:]` Approximate; rerun on D-422A with precise NC standard
deduction annualized per IRS-aligned convention. The pattern shows: tiny
Q1 and Q2, large Q3 catch-up, zero Q4. No penalty results because each
installment met its annualized cumulative threshold.

### Example 3 — High-income MFJ with W-2 withholding shortfall

> **Taxpayer:** MFJ, both spouses NC residents. Spouse A: W-2 salary
> $180,000, NC withholding $7,200. Spouse B: freelance income $130,000,
> no withholding. Prior-year (2024) NC AGI: $295,000 (>$150,000 → **110%
> rule applies**). Prior-year NC tax: $13,800.

**Projected 2025 NC tax:**
- NC AGI ≈ $310,000 − $25,500 MFJ std ded = $284,500
- Tax = $284,500 × 4.25% = **$12,091**

**Safe harbor:**
- 90% current year = $12,091 × 0.90 = $10,882
- 110% prior year = $13,800 × 1.10 = $15,180
- **RAP = lower = $10,882**

**Test threshold:**
- Expected tax $12,091 − withholding $7,200 = $4,891 ≥ $1,000 → estimates required

**Required quarterly cash payment (after withholding):**
- Withholding credit per quarter = $7,200 ÷ 4 = $1,800
- Required installment per quarter = $10,882 ÷ 4 = $2,721
- Net NC-40 payment per quarter = $2,721 − $1,800 = **$921**

| Q | Due | NC-40 Payment |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Apr 15, 2025 | $921 |
| 2 | Jun 15, 2025 | $921 |
| 3 | Sep 15, 2025 | $921 |
| 4 | Jan 15, 2026 | $920 |
| **Total** | | **$3,683** |

**Alternative — increase Spouse A's W-2 withholding:** If Spouse A files a
new NC-4 to add ~$300/month extra NC withholding ($3,600 annual), total
withholding rises to $10,800 → covers 90% safe harbor without any NC-40
payments. Withholding is **deemed paid evenly across the year**, so this
also retroactively cures any Q1/Q2 shortfall. This is the cleanest fix
for W-2 dominated households.
