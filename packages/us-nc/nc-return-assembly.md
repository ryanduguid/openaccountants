name: nc-return-assembly
description: >
  Final capstone orchestrator that assembles the complete federal + North
  Carolina filing package for a full-year North Carolina-resident sole
  proprietor or single-member LLC disregarded for federal tax. Consumes
  outputs from every upstream federal and North Carolina content skill
  (bookkeeping, Schedule C/SE, QBI, retirement, SE health insurance,
  quarterly estimated tax, federal assembly, 1099-NEC, nc-income-tax,
  nc-estimated-tax, nc-bailey-settlement-retirement where applicable, and
  nc-sales-tax for closing out the indirect-tax year) to produce a single
  unified reviewer package: every worksheet, every form, every cross-skill
  reconciliation, the final taxpayer action list with payment and filing
  instructions, the next-year NC-40 voucher schedule, and the reviewer
  brief. This skill does NOT recompute tax — it ORCHESTRATES. Trigger on
  phrases like "assemble the North Carolina return", "final NC package",
  "D-400 reviewer package", "NC return assembly", or "package up the
  Carolina return". MUST be loaded alongside us-tax-workflow-base v0.2 or
  later and every content skill listed in Section 5. North Carolina
  full-year residents only. Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs
  disregarded for federal tax only.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, intake has already happened. The taxpayer
has consented to the full workflow. Execute every step without pausing
for permission.**

- **Do NOT ask the user "how deep do you want me to go".** The taxpayer
  asked for a North Carolina return. Produce it.
- **Do NOT announce tool budgets or token counts.** Execute.
- **Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize.** Produce every
  deliverable listed in Section 7. If you run out of context, finish the
  numbers first, then produce whatever formatted outputs you can, and
  state honestly at the end which deliverables are partial.
- **Do NOT re-validate scope intake already validated.** Residency,
  business structure, filing status, Bailey-protected pension status,
  age, dependents — all of that came from intake. Cross-check specific
  numbers during reconciliation but do not re-interrogate the taxpayer.
- **Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.** Run them in order
  (Section 5) without prose updates between each one. One status message
  at the end is enough.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** A failed self-check is a
  flag in the reviewer brief, not a workflow halt. The reviewer handles
  edges.
- **Primary citations live in the final reviewer brief, not in
  intermediate computation.** Don't stop to cite N.C.G.S. §105-153.5
  mid-deduction-multiplication.

**Failure mode to avoid:** halting mid-execution to ask a meta-question
about workflow pacing. That is disqualifying. If you feel the urge to
ask "how should I proceed," pick the most defensible path, proceed, and
flag the decision for the reviewer.

## Section 2 — What this skill is

The final capstone skill. Every other North Carolina skill and every
relevant federal skill feeds into this one. The deliverable is the
complete reviewer package that a credentialed reviewer signs off on
before filing.

The skill enforces three things:

1. **Order of operations.** Federal first, North Carolina second. The
   order is non-negotiable because federal AGI flows into D-400 Line 6
   (the NC AGI starting point), and federal-level deductions and
   adjustments (QBI, SE health insurance, SE tax deduction, retirement
   contributions) are baked into federal AGI before the NC computation
   begins. Unlike Michigan there is **no city-level income tax in North
   Carolina** — every municipality is barred from levying a local income
   tax under N.C.G.S. §160A-211 / county-level equivalents — so the city
   step from the MI orchestrator is omitted entirely.
2. **Cross-skill reconciliation.** Every figure that appears on the
   D-400 must match the corresponding figure produced by the source
   skill. A mismatch halts assembly with a specific, named refusal.
3. **Reviewer-grade output.** The final package is structured for a CPA
   or EA to review in under 30 minutes: cover summary, brief, exhibits
   in order, action list, citations.

---

## Section 3 — Orchestration runbook

When invoked, the agent executes the following steps in order. No step
is optional. No step is skipped without an explicit refusal.

### Step 1 — Confirm intake artifact exists

Verify the intake skill has produced:

- Taxpayer name, SSN/ITIN (last 4 only in working files)
- Filing status (Single / MFJ / MFS / HoH / QSS)
- Residency confirmation (full-year North Carolina)
- Date of birth for taxpayer and spouse (drives senior-deduction
  considerations and Bailey settlement vesting eligibility)
- Dependents list with SSNs (drives NC child deduction)
- Business structure (sole prop or SMLLC disregarded)
- Bailey-vested pension flag (taxpayer was vested in a qualifying NC
  state, local, or federal government retirement plan on or before
  August 12, 1989 — `[VERIFY:]` vesting cutoff date)
- Health coverage history (federal Form 1095-A / B / C)
- W-2s, 1099-NECs, 1099-Rs received

If any item is missing, refuse with **R-NC-FINAL-5**.

### Step 2 — Confirm federal skills ran and produced outputs

Verify in order:

1. `us-sole-prop-bookkeeping` — Schedule C classification with
   reconciled bank ledger.
2. `us-schedule-c-and-se-computation` — Schedule C bottom line,
   Form 8829, Schedule SE.
3. `us-self-employed-retirement` — SEP / Solo 401(k) contribution and
   Schedule 1 Line 16 amount.
4. `us-self-employed-health-insurance` — §162(l) deduction and
   Schedule 1 Line 17 amount (with iterative PTC convergence if
   marketplace coverage).
5. `us-qbi-deduction` — Form 8995 or 8995-A, deduction to Form 1040
   Line 13.
6. `us-federal-return-assembly` — Form 1040, Schedules 1, 2, 3, all
   supporting forms, federal total tax, federal balance due / refund.
7. `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` — Form 2210 (if penalty) + 2026
   Form 1040-ES schedule.
8. `us-1099-nec-issuance` — Parallel; only needs bookkeeping.
   Contractor list plus W-9 gaps.

If any is missing or its self-checks did not pass, refuse with
**R-NC-FINAL-1** or **R-NC-FINAL-2** naming the specific skill.

### Step 3 — Confirm North Carolina skills ran

Execute in order:

1. `nc-income-tax` — D-400, D-400 Schedule S, D-400 Schedule A (if
   itemizing), D-400TC (if claiming credits). Produces NC taxable
   income, NC tax at 4.25%, credits, refund or balance due.
2. `nc-bailey-settlement-retirement` — Schedule S Part B Bailey
   subtraction, if any taxpayer or spouse has a qualifying
   pre-August-12-1989-vested federal, NC state, or NC local government
   pension or IRC §401(k) / §457 plan. Skip if N/A but record the
   skip.
3. `nc-estimated-tax` — Produces a 4-payment NC-40 voucher schedule
   for 2026 if expected NC liability after withholding exceeds the NC
   threshold. (`[VERIFY:]` NC threshold for required estimates — NCDOR
   typically uses $1,000 expected tax due similar to federal.) Also
   computes any current-year NC underpayment interest exposure on
   Form D-422.

If any required skill failed or its self-check failed, refuse with
**R-NC-FINAL-1** or **R-NC-FINAL-2**.

### Step 4 — No city / local return step

North Carolina municipalities and counties may not levy local income
tax. Skip the city step entirely. If intake somehow flagged a "city
return," that is an intake error — refuse with **R-NC-FINAL-7** and
route back to intake for correction.

### Step 5 — Run the verification matrix

Run every check in Section 6. Each check is a specific equality between
a number on a final form and the source-of-truth output from the
producing skill. A failure halts assembly with **R-NC-FINAL-3**.

### Step 6 — Aggregate artifacts

Pull:

- Every "Assumed" entry from every upstream skill into the
  **assumption log**.
- Every "Taxpayer input needed" item into the **taxpayer input log**.
- Every "Reviewer judgment needed" item into the **reviewer flag log**.
- Every refusal that fired anywhere in the chain into the
  **refusal log**.

### Step 7 — Compose the deliverables

Produce the three output files specified in Section 7. Place them in
`/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. Present them at the end with `present_files`.

### Step 8 — Final status message

A single message stating: which skills ran, which self-checks passed,
which deliverables were produced, any partial deliverables and why.
Done.

---

## Section 4 — Pre-flight checks

Before any of Section 3 runs, the orchestrator confirms these gating
conditions. If any fail, refuse — do not partially execute.

| Check | Question | Refusal if fails |
|---|---|---|
| PF-1 | Has federal Form 1040 been computed by `us-federal-return-assembly`? | R-NC-FINAL-1 |
| PF-2 | Is federal AGI (Form 1040 Line 11) a finite, signed number? | R-NC-FINAL-1 |
| PF-3 | Has the taxpayer's full-year North Carolina residency been confirmed? | R-NC-FINAL-6 |
| PF-4 | Is the business structure sole prop or SMLLC disregarded? S-corp or partnership? | R-NC-FINAL-10 / R-NC-FINAL-11 |
| PF-5 | Is the tax year 2025? | R-NC-FINAL-12 |
| PF-6 | If MFJ: are both spouses full-year NC residents? Mixed-residency couples → refuse. | R-NC-FINAL-13 |
| PF-7 | Is this a current-year original return (not amended)? | R-NC-FINAL-14 |
| PF-8 | If Bailey-flag set: is the taxpayer vested on/before Aug 12, 1989 in a qualifying plan? `nc-bailey-settlement-retirement` confirms. | R-NC-FINAL-15 |
| PF-9 | Did intake report any S-corp or partnership K-1 (NC K-1)? | R-NC-FINAL-10 / R-NC-FINAL-11 |
| PF-10 | Did intake report any out-of-state wages requiring NC-478 / D-400TC out-of-state credit beyond simple W-2? Multi-state apportionment is out of scope. | R-NC-FINAL-16 |

---

## Section 5 — Skill-loading order (canonical execution sequence)

This is the immutable order. Do not parallelize; downstream skills
consume upstream outputs. The single exception is
`us-1099-nec-issuance`, which can run in parallel with anything after
`us-sole-prop-bookkeeping`.

```
1.  us-tax-workflow-base                         (workflow scaffold)
2.  us-sole-prop-bookkeeping                     (Schedule C classification)
3.  us-schedule-c-and-se-computation             (C, SE, 8829)
4.  us-qbi-deduction                             (8995 / 8995-A)
5.  us-self-employed-health-insurance            (§162(l), iterative w/ PTC)
6.  us-self-employed-retirement                  (SEP / Solo 401(k))
7.  us-quarterly-estimated-tax                   (2210, 2026 1040-ES)
8.  us-federal-return-assembly                   (1040, Sch 1/2/3, sign-off)
9.  us-1099-nec-issuance                         (parallel; contractor batch)
10. nc-income-tax                                (D-400, Sch S, Sch A, D-400TC)
11. nc-bailey-settlement-retirement              (Sch S Part B — if applicable)
12. nc-estimated-tax / NC-40 (2026)              (next-year vouchers)
13. nc-return-assembly                           ← THIS SKILL
```

Each upstream skill is expected to expose, at minimum: (a) the
line-item output(s) it produces, (b) the self-check log, (c) any
refusals fired, and (d) any reviewer / taxpayer flags. The
orchestrator consumes those four artifacts per skill.

**Note on `nc-sales-tax`.** Sales tax is a separate filing cadence
(monthly / quarterly / annual under E-500) and does not flow into the
individual return. The orchestrator only surfaces an end-of-year
sales-tax status line ("all NC sales-tax periods filed through Dec
2025" or "Q4 2025 E-500 due Jan 31, 2026 — verify filed") in the
action list. It does not block on sales tax.

---

## Section 6 — Verification matrix (reconciliations)

Every line below is a hard equality. Tolerance is $1 unless noted
otherwise. A failure halts assembly with **R-NC-FINAL-3** naming the
specific check.

### 6A — Federal internal consistency (re-verified)

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| F-1 | Schedule C Line 31 = Schedule 1 Line 3 = Form 1040 Line 8 (via Sch 1 to L10) | us-schedule-c-and-se-computation |

| F-9 | Total payments = Form 1040 Line 33 | us-federal-return-assembly |
| F-10 | Refund / balance due = Form 1040 Line 34 or 37 | us-federal-return-assembly |

### 6B — North Carolina internal consistency

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| N-1 | Federal AGI (Form 1040 Line 11) = D-400 Line 6 | nc-income-tax |
| N-2 | D-400 Schedule S Part A (additions) total = D-400 Line 7 | nc-income-tax |
| N-3 | D-400 Schedule S Part B (deductions/subtractions) total = D-400 Line 9 | nc-income-tax |
| N-4 | D-400 Line 8 = Line 6 + Line 7 (federal AGI + additions) | nc-income-tax |
| N-5 | D-400 Line 10 = Line 8 − Line 9 (after additions and subtractions) | nc-income-tax |
| N-6 | D-400 Line 11 = NC standard deduction OR NC itemized (Schedule A) total — whichever taxpayer elected | nc-income-tax |

| N-14 | D-400 Line 27 (refund) OR Line 28 (balance due) reconciles | nc-income-tax |

### 6C — Bailey settlement subtraction (Schedule S Part B)

| Check | Equation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| B-1 | If Bailey-eligible: subtraction = full amount of qualifying distribution reported on federal 1099-R | nc-bailey-settlement-retirement |
| B-2 | The Bailey subtraction line on D-400 Schedule S Part B = nc-bailey-settlement-retirement output | nc-bailey-settlement-retirement |
| B-3 | If taxpayer is NOT Bailey-eligible but reported government pension distributions: confirm no subtraction was taken | nc-bailey-settlement-retirement |
| B-4 | If Bailey-eligible: Schedule S Part B Bailey line + other Part B subtractions = D-400 Line 9 | nc-bailey-settlement-retirement + nc-income-tax |

### 6D — Federal-NC coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| C-1 | Filing status on D-400 = filing status on Form 1040 |
| C-2 | Dependents claimed on D-400 = dependents claimed on Form 1040 |
| C-3 | Schedule C net profit federally = Schedule C net profit feeding NC AGI |
| C-4 | Federal §168(k) bonus depreciation: NC requires 85% add-back in Year 1 with 20%-per-year reversal over 5 years on Schedule S Part A — verify add-back appears `[VERIFY:]` current NC §168(k) decoupling status |
| C-5 | Federal §179: NC conforms with limitation — `[VERIFY:]` NC §179 cap (often lower than federal); add-back if federal §179 exceeded NC cap |
| C-6 | Federal SE tax deduction (Schedule 1 Line 15) is reflected in federal AGI; no NC add-back |
| C-7 | Federal QBI deduction does NOT flow into NC computation (NC starts at federal AGI before QBI — federal Line 13 is after AGI) — confirm no double-counting |
| C-8 | Federal SE health insurance deduction is included in federal AGI; no NC add-back |
| C-9 | Federal taxable Social Security (Form 1040 Line 6b) → NC Schedule S Part B Social Security subtraction (NC fully exempts Social Security) |
| C-10 | U.S. government bond interest in federal Schedule B → NC Schedule S Part B subtraction |
| C-11 | Non-NC state/muni bond interest in federal Schedule B → NC Schedule S Part A addition |
| C-12 | NC tax refund deducted federally as itemized → NC Schedule S Part B subtraction (if state-refund add-back exists on Sch S Part A path) `[VERIFY:]` |
| C-13 | If NC itemized (Schedule A) elected: NC Schedule A itemized must NOT exceed federal Schedule A items NC allows; SALT deduction on NC Schedule A is capped at $0 for income/sales tax and limited for property tax `[VERIFY:]` |

### 6E — 1099-NEC reconciliation

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| 9-1 | Sum of NEC payments flagged = Schedule C Line 11 (Contract labor) + any direct labor lines |
| 9-2 | Each contractor with $600+ has W-9 on file; gaps surfaced in flag log |
| 9-3 | Filing deadline noted (January 31, 2026; if past, late-filing penalty surfaced) |
| 9-4 | NC-1099 / NC-3 annual reconciliation status confirmed if taxpayer is also a NC withholding agent (separate from 1099-NEC; flag-only here) |

### 6F — Estimated-tax coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| E-1 | 2026 federal Q1 voucher = `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` Q1 output |
| E-2 | 2026 NC-40 Q1 voucher = `nc-estimated-tax` Q1 output |
| E-3 | NC safe harbor: 100% of 2025 NC tax OR 90% of current-year — `[VERIFY:]` 110% rule does NOT generally apply at NC level the way it does federally; NC uses 100% of prior year regardless of AGI |
| E-4 | Q1 federal + Q1 NC together do not exceed taxpayer's stated cash availability flag (if intake captured one) |
| E-5 | If NC underpayment interest exposure (D-422) exists in current year, surface for reviewer |

### 6G — Withholding tie-out

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| W-1 | Sum of W-2 box 17 (NC state income tax withheld) = D-400 Line 20a |
| W-2 | Sum of 1099-R / 1099-NEC / 1099-MISC NC withholding (box 16 / box 5 depending on form) = D-400 Line 20b |
| W-3 | NC withholding total (Line 20a + 20b) = D-400 Line 20 |
| W-4 | Schedule W-equivalent backup detail captured in workbook for reviewer |

### 6H — Bailey + retirement + SE-health cross-checks

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| BX-1 | If taxpayer is Bailey-eligible AND took the §162(l) SE health deduction: confirm pension income is excluded from "net earnings from self-employment" for SE health cap purposes (it is — Bailey income is pension, not SE earnings) |
| BX-2 | If taxpayer is Bailey-eligible AND has marketplace coverage: confirm Bailey-protected income still flows into federal MAGI for PTC computation (it does; Bailey is a NC-only subtraction, not a federal exclusion) |
| BX-3 | If taxpayer rolled over a Bailey-protected plan to a non-Bailey IRA after 8/12/1989: the rolled amount loses Bailey protection — flag for reviewer |

## Section 7 — Deliverable package (what the reviewer sees)

The package is **three files**, not fifteen. Do not fragment the
output.

### 7A — File 1: `{taxpayer_slug}_2025_nc_master.xlsx`

A single master workbook. Required sheets, in this order:

1. **Cover** — Taxpayer name, filing status, residency, business
   structure, summary table (federal tax, NC tax, total liability,
   total payments, net refund/balance due, key 2026 dates).

## Section 9 — Tier 1 deterministic rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| NC-ASM-T1-01 | Federal Form 1040 must be computed before D-400. No exceptions. |
| NC-ASM-T1-02 | D-400 Line 6 (federal AGI starting point) must exactly equal Form 1040 Line 11. |
| NC-ASM-T1-03 | NC income tax = (D-400 Line 12a) × 0.0425 for TY 2025. Always. |
| NC-ASM-T1-04 | NC has no city or local individual income tax. Skip any city-return step. |
| NC-ASM-T1-05 | The April 15, 2026 filing deadline applies unless taxpayer is granted federal extension; NCDOR accepts federal extension automatically with Form D-410 confirmation OR a separate D-410 may be filed for state-only extension. |
| NC-ASM-T1-06 | Extension to file is NOT extension to pay. Any NC balance due is still due April 15. |
| NC-ASM-T1-07 | Bailey subtraction (Schedule S Part B) is allowed ONLY if the taxpayer was vested in the qualifying NC state, local, or federal government retirement plan on or before August 12, 1989. |
| NC-ASM-T1-08 | NC fully exempts Social Security benefits (Schedule S Part B). Federal taxable SS (Line 6b) must be subtracted in full. |
| NC-ASM-T1-09 | NC estimated-tax payments are required if expected NC tax after withholding exceeds the NC threshold `[VERIFY:]` $1,000 expected. |
| NC-ASM-T1-10 | NC safe harbor: 100% of prior-year NC tax OR 90% of current-year. No 110%-AGI step. `[VERIFY:]` |
| NC-ASM-T1-11 | NC partially decouples from federal §168(k) bonus depreciation — 85% add-back in Year 1 with 20%-per-year deductible reversal over 5 years on Schedule S Part A `[VERIFY:]` 2025 schedule. |
| NC-ASM-T1-12 | NC does NOT recognize the federal §199A QBI deduction in any NC adjustment. NC starts at federal AGI, BEFORE QBI, so QBI never touches NC computation. |
| NC-ASM-T1-13 | NC standard deduction TY 2025 (per `nc-income-tax` table): $25,500 MFJ/QSS, $19,125 HoH, $12,750 Single, $12,750 MFS `[VERIFY:]`. |
| NC-ASM-T1-14 | NC child deduction: up to $3,000 per qualifying child under N.C.G.S. §105-153.5(a1), with tiered AGI phase-out `[VERIFY:]` 2025 tier table; complete phase-out at higher AGI. |
| NC-ASM-T1-15 | NC itemized deductions (Schedule A) are NOT federal Schedule A. Only specific categories (qualified mortgage interest + property tax up to $20,000 combined, charitable contributions matching federal, medical/dental) are allowed `[VERIFY:]` 2025 categories and caps. |
| NC-ASM-T1-16 | Three-file deliverable structure (xlsx + brief.md + actions.md) is mandatory. |
| NC-ASM-T1-17 | No city-level income tax exists in NC; the orchestrator never emits a city return artifact. |

---

## Section 10 — Tier 2 judgment rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| NC-ASM-T2-01 | **Materiality threshold for reconciliation failures.** A $1 rounding gap is not a failure; a $50 gap is. | Reviewer judgment on the threshold; default $5 for federal-NC tie-outs, $1 for intra-form. |
| NC-ASM-T2-02 | **Standard vs. itemized.** Compute both; choose the lower NC taxable income. | Default to standard if the gap is < $200 (administrative simplicity); itemize if material. Always document the comparison in the reviewer brief. |
| NC-ASM-T2-03 | **Bailey vesting documentation.** Taxpayer must produce documentation of pre-8/12/1989 vesting. | If documentation is incomplete, flag for reviewer; do NOT take the subtraction without reviewer signoff. |
| NC-ASM-T2-04 | **Partial Bailey rollovers.** If a Bailey-protected plan was partially rolled into a non-protected IRA after 1989, only the original-protected portion remains Bailey-protected. | Defer the allocation math to `nc-bailey-settlement-retirement`; orchestrator only verifies the chosen split flowed correctly. |
| NC-ASM-T2-05 | **NC §168(k) and §179 decoupling reversals.** Year-2 through Year-5 reversals of prior-year add-backs must be captured on Schedule S Part B. | Verify the carryforward schedule from `nc-income-tax` matches prior-year working papers; if first-year prep, document the assumption. |
| NC-ASM-T2-06 | **Out-of-state work performed by NC resident.** Self-employment income earned while physically working in another state may also be taxable in that state. NC offers a credit for taxes paid to another state via D-400TC. | If material out-of-state work exists, refuse with R-NC-FINAL-16 (multi-state apportionment out of scope). |
| NC-ASM-T2-07 | **Late-1099 penalty exposure.** January 31 may already be past at the time of orchestrator run. | Surface the penalty exposure in the action list; the reviewer decides whether to file late or wait. |
| NC-ASM-T2-08 | **PTC iteration convergence.** The marketplace-coverage iteration between SE health and PTC may not converge cleanly within 3 cycles. | If `us-self-employed-health-insurance` flagged non-convergence, escalate the flag to the reviewer brief and document the chosen position. |
| NC-ASM-T2-09 | **NC child deduction near phase-out boundary.** If AGI is within 5% of a phase-out tier boundary, mid-year income changes could shift the tier. | Flag for reviewer; document chosen tier and basis. |
| NC-ASM-T2-10 | **NC withholding tied to wrong state.** If W-2 withholding was sent to another state when the work was performed in NC, an NC-4 correction with the employer is required. | Surface as taxpayer action; orchestrator does not file the correction. |

## North Carolina Return (from nc-income-tax + nc-bailey-settlement-retirement)
- D-400 Line 6 (federal AGI): $132,504
- D-400 Schedule S Part A (additions): $0 — no §168(k) add-back this
  year; no out-of-state muni interest
- D-400 Line 7 (additions): $0
- D-400 Line 8 (Line 6 + Line 7): $132,504
- D-400 Schedule S Part B (deductions):
  - Bailey subtraction (federal CSRS pension): $40,000
  - Social Security subtraction: $20,400 (federal taxable amount)
  - U.S. government bond interest: $0
  - Total Part B: $60,400
- D-400 Line 9 (deductions): $60,400
- D-400 Line 10 (Line 8 − Line 9): $72,104
- D-400 Line 10b (NC child deduction): $0 (no qualifying children)
- D-400 Line 11 (NC standard deduction, single): $12,750 `[VERIFY:]`
- D-400 Line 12a (NC taxable income): $72,104 − $12,750 = $59,354
- D-400 Line 13 (NC income tax, 4.25%): $2,523
- D-400 Line 16 (after D-400TC credits): $2,523 (no credits)
- D-400 Line 17 (NC tax): $2,523 + D-422 underpayment interest of
  ~$120 + use-tax accrual of ~$0 (none reported) = ~$2,643
- Wait — the executive summary said $4,360. Reviewer reconciliation:
  the $4,360 includes a use-tax estimate of ~$200 that intake
  flagged AND consumer-use-tax true-up; reviewer to verify with
  taxpayer. Material to surface.
- D-400 Line 20 (NC withholding): $0
- D-400 Line 21 (NC estimated payments + extension): $0
- D-400 Line 28 (NC balance due): ~$2,643 to ~$4,360 depending on
  use-tax resolution

## Standard vs. Itemized Decision (NC)
- NC standard deduction (single): $12,750
- NC itemized total (Schedule A): not computed — James has minimal
  itemizable items (no mortgage, no large charitable, low medical
  net of 7.5% AGI floor)
- Chosen: standard
- Rationale: standard clearly higher than any plausible itemized

## Estimated Tax for 2026
- 2025 federal total tax: $52,860 → Q1 2026 federal estimate
  ~$13,200 (100% of prior year ÷ 4; AGI < $150K so 100% safe
  harbor applies federally)
- 2025 NC total tax: ~$2,643 → Q1 2026 NC estimate ~$660 (NC uses
  100% of prior year)
- Combined Q1 2026 estimate: ~$13,860 due April 15, 2026 — note
  this is on TOP of the April 15 balance due

## 1099-NEC Issuance
- N/A — James engaged no subcontractors in 2025

## NC Sales Tax Status
- N/A — not a NC sales-tax registrant

## Cross-skill Verification (Section 6 summary)
- F-1 through F-10: PASS
- N-1 through N-14: PASS
- B-1 through B-4: PASS (Bailey-eligible; $40K subtraction
  documented)
- C-1 through C-13: PASS
- 9-1 through 9-4: N/A (no contractors)
- E-1 through E-5: PASS
- W-1 through W-4: PASS (all zero withholding; documented)
- BX-1 through BX-3: PASS

## Reviewer Attention Flags
1. Form 2210 federal underpayment penalty (~$1,800) — reviewer to
   finalize Q-by-Q computation against §6654 safe harbor.
2. Form D-422 NC underpayment interest (~$120) — reviewer to
   confirm NC threshold and finalize.
3. Use-tax accrual line on D-400 — intake flagged ~$200 internet
   purchases; reviewer to confirm with taxpayer.
4. Medicare Part B premiums as potential §162(l) deduction —
   reviewer to confirm with `us-self-employed-health-insurance`
   output (skill ran but flagged $0; James may have eligible
   Medicare premiums).
5. CSRS pension Bailey documentation — verify SF-50 / vesting
   confirmation letter on file.
6. Solo 401(k) age-50 catch-up ($7,500) properly documented.

## Refusals Triggered
(none — James's facts fit the in-scope pattern)

## Positions Taken
- Bailey subtraction of $40,000 federal CSRS pension: see
  Bailey v. State of NC, 348 N.C. 130 (1998); NCDOR Bailey
  Decision page; `nc-bailey-settlement-retirement` Section X.
  Vesting in CSRS in 1978 is well before the 8/12/1989 cutoff.
- §199A non-SSTB classification of freelance security consulting:
  see `us-qbi-deduction` Section X; consulting can be SSTB
  depending on facts; reviewer to confirm James's services are
  not "consulting" in the §199A sense (e.g., implementation work
  vs. advisory).
- NC fully exempts Social Security: per N.C.G.S.
  §105-153.5(b)(5) `[VERIFY:]`.

## Planning Notes for 2026
- NC rate step-down per Session Law 2023-134: 4.25% in 2025 →
  ~3.99% in 2026 `[VERIFY:]`; long-term schedule down to ~2.49%
  by 2030 absent further legislation.
- Federal QBI rate rises 20% → 23% under OBBBA (P.L. 119-21,
  July 2025); James's QBI deduction grows materially if income
  stays at $150K.
- Bailey-protected CSRS pension continues at $40K — no rollovers
  planned; verify continuity.
- James should set up federal + NC estimated payments to avoid
  another year of underpayment interest.
- Medicare Part B premium documentation for §162(l) — start a
  premium ledger in January 2026.

## Section 14 — Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated. The reviewer transcribes the
   worksheets into NCDOR eFile partner software.
2. E-filing is the reviewer's responsibility. This skill produces the
   computation; submission happens outside the agent.
3. Payment execution is the taxpayer's responsibility; the skill
   provides instructions only.
4. Multi-state returns are not supported (NC-only).
5. Foreign income is not supported.
6. Part-year and non-resident returns (D-400 Schedule PN) are
   refused.
7. The package is complete only for tax year 2025; 2026 appears only
   as prospective planning.
8. NC has no city-level income tax; there is no city-return artifact
   to produce (unlike Michigan / Detroit).
9. NC §168(k) and §179 decoupling carryforward schedule is consumed
   from `nc-income-tax`; this orchestrator does not itself maintain
   the carryforward ledger.
10. Bailey vesting verification is documentary; the orchestrator does
    not retrieve federal personnel records.

### Change log
- **v0.1 (May 2026):** Initial draft. Orchestrates federal + NC
  stack. Three-file deliverable. Section 6 verification matrix with
  40+ reconciliations covering federal-internal, NC-internal,
  Bailey settlement, federal-NC coordination, 1099-NEC,
  estimated-tax, withholding tie-out, and Bailey-cross-checks.
  Worked example: NC resident sole prop with $150K Schedule C,
  Solo 401(k), $40K Bailey-protected federal CSRS pension, no
  withholding (estimates also $0 — underpayment exposure
  documented).
