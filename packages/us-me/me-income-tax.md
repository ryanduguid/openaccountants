## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Maine taxable income begins with **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Additions** — Add back items Maine does not exclude (e.g., interest on non-Maine state/municipal bonds).
2. **Subtractions** — Subtract items Maine excludes (e.g., Social Security benefits included in federal AGI, U.S. government pension income, Maine public pension income).
3. **Maine adjusted gross income** — Federal AGI + additions − subtractions.
4. **Standard or itemized deduction** — Maine conforms to the federal standard deduction amounts (with phase-out at higher incomes) or allows Maine itemized deductions.
5. **Personal exemption** — $5,300 per qualifying person (2026).
6. **Maine taxable income** — Maine AGI − deduction − exemptions.
7. **Tax** — Apply graduated rates to Maine taxable income.
8. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits (child care, earned income, property tax fairness, etc.).

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** flows through federal Schedule C → federal AGI → Maine AGI. No separate Maine schedule for self-employment income is required.
2. **Federal SE tax deduction** — The 50% self-employment tax deduction is already reflected in federal AGI. Maine begins from federal AGI, so this deduction carries through automatically.
3. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments (Form 1040ES-ME) if they expect to owe $1,000 or more after withholding and credits. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
4. **Business equipment depreciation** — Maine generally conforms to federal depreciation rules, including IRC § 179 expensing. Maine does NOT conform to 100% federal bonus depreciation under IRC § 168(k); check the current conformity date for partial adjustments.
5. **Home office deduction** — Flows through federal Schedule C; no separate Maine adjustment needed.
6. **Health insurance deduction** — The self-employed health insurance deduction is included in federal AGI. No Maine add-back required.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| ME-T2-01 | **Residency determination** — Maine uses a domicile + permanent place of abode test. A taxpayer who maintains a permanent home in Maine and spends more than 183 days there is a statutory resident. | If the taxpayer has homes in multiple states, flag for professional review. |
| ME-T2-02 | **Bonus depreciation conformity** — Maine selectively conforms to IRC § 168(k). Check the current conformity date; partial add-backs may be required. | Compare Maine conformity date to federal asset placed-in-service date. |
| ME-T2-03 | **Standard deduction phase-out** — Computation requires interpolation when AGI is in the phase-out range. | If AGI is near the threshold, compute the reduced deduction carefully. |
| ME-T2-04 | **Credit for taxes paid to other states** — Non-refundable credit to prevent double taxation on income earned in another state. | Requires the other state's return to compute; flag if multi-state. |
| ME-T2-05 | **Maine itemized deductions** — If the taxpayer itemizes, Maine generally conforms to federal itemized deductions with some modifications (e.g., Maine caps the medical expense threshold). | Compare federal Schedule A to Maine allowable amounts. |
