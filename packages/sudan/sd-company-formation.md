# Sudan Company Formation & Entity Choice Skill

## Sudan Company Formation & Entity Choice Skill v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

> **Currency note:** All figures are in Sudanese Pounds (SDG — ج.س). Sudan has undergone multiple currency redenominations; verify current SDG values before filing.
> **YMYL — verify before relying.** Sudan's company registration framework operates under disrupted conditions since the October 2021 military takeover and the conflict since April 2023. Registration timelines vary widely. Where this skill says "verify current value," re-confirm against the Sudan Taxation Chamber (tax.gov.sd), the Commercial Registrar, or a Sudan-qualified formation agent before acting.

## Section 3 — Entity types, capital and incorporation

### Common entity types

**Common entity types**  _(Companies Act)_

| Entity type | Key features | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Limited Liability Company (LLC) — شركة ذات مسؤولية محدودة** | 1+ shareholder; 1+ director; any nationality; limited liability; most common for SMEs | Companies Act |
| **Public Joint-Stock Company — شركة مساهمة عامة** | Larger capital; shares publicly tradable; suitable for large enterprises | Companies Act |
| **Private Joint-Stock Company — شركة مساهمة خاصة** | Private shares; shares not publicly tradable | Companies Act |
| **Branch of a Foreign Company — فرع شركة أجنبية** | Foreign company opens a branch; representative required; subject to approval | Companies Act |
| **Partnership — شركة تضامن / شركة توصية بسيطة** | General partnerships (تضامن) with unlimited joint liability; limited partnerships (توصية) with mixed liability | Companies Act |
| **Sole Proprietorship — مؤسسة فردية** | Single owner; unlimited liability; simplest form | Commercial Registrations |

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Source uncertain between Companies Act 2015 (per chandrawatpartners) and Companies Act 2017 (per Scribd reference). Verify against the **official Commercial Registrar / gazette publication** before incorporation.

## Section 4 — Registration procedure

### Incorporation steps (typical LLC)

1. **Reserve company name** at the Commercial (Trade) Registrar — verify availability
2. **Prepare Memorandum of Association (MOA)** — includes objectives, capital, members
3. **Prepare Articles of Association (AOA)** — internal governance rules
4. **Submit documents to the Commercial Registrar:**
   - Memorandum of Association
   - Articles of Association
   - Proof of registered address (utility bill or tenancy agreement)
   - Identification documents (passport or national ID) of shareholders and directors
   - Application form
5. **Obtain Commercial Registration certificate**
6. **Register with Sudan Taxation Chamber** for tax purposes and obtain TRN
7. **Register for VAT** if turnover at/above SDG 1,200,000 threshold (or if importing/exporting)
8. **Register with NSIF** if hiring employees for social insurance
9. **Sectoral licensing** where required (banking, oil, telecom — see Section 7)

### Typical timeline

**Typical timeline**

| Step | Typical duration |
| --- | --- |
| Name reservation | 1-3 business days |
| MOA/AOA preparation | 3-7 days |
| Commercial Registrar filing | 1-4 weeks (varies significantly) |
| Tax registration with Taxation Chamber | 1-2 weeks |
| VAT registration (if applicable) | 1-2 weeks |
| NSIF registration | 3 stages (employer, employee enrollment) |
| Sectoral licensing | Varies — banking and petroleum can take 3-6 months |

**Total: typically 4-12 weeks** for a straightforward LLC; significantly longer for sector-licensed industries.

## Section 5 — Capital requirements

**Capital requirements**

| Entity type | Minimum capital | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **LLC** | No fixed statutory minimum; capital varies by activity | Companies Act |
| **Public Joint-Stock Company** | Higher minimum — verify (commonly higher) | Companies Act |
| **Private Joint-Stock Company** | Mid-range minimum — verify | Companies Act |
| **Branch of foreign company** | No separate capital — relies on parent | Companies Act |
| **Free zone company** | Investment minimum defined by Free Zones Authority per sector | Free Zones Act |

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** The "no fixed statutory minimum" for LLC is widely reported but must be cross-checked against any current Ministerial decree or sector-specific requirement. Capital adequacy is fundamental for banking and petroleum applications.

### Initial depreciation and investment incentives

- **Newly purchased machinery and equipment initial depreciation** — 20% initial depreciation of purchase price after being put into production %  _(Investment Incentive Law 2021)_
- **Qualifying investment projects CIT exemption** — Corporate income tax exemption starting from commercial production date, period not exceeding 5 years (see `sd-corporate-income-tax`)  _(Investment Incentive Law 2021)_

## Section 6 — Tax registrations

### Income tax registration (Tax Authority)

- Every company must register with the Sudan Taxation Chamber
- Tax Registration Number (TRN) is assigned
- Self-assessment system applies — return filed and tax paid at time of submission

### VAT registration (if applicable)

- Required when:
  - Industrial producer, trader, or service provider with turnover ≥ SDG 1,200,000
  - Importer or exporter (regardless of turnover)
  - Voluntary registration available (subject to 2-year minimum commitment)
- Requires filing Form 1 with the local tax office
- Registration Certificate issued (Form 2) — must be displayed at all branches
- See `sd-vat-gst` for full VAT mechanics

- **VAT registration turnover threshold** — SDG 1,200,000 SDG (Industrial producer, trader, or service provider with turnover ≥ SDG 1,200,000; importers/exporters regardless of turnover)

### Social insurance registration (NSIF / NHIF)

**Social insurance registration (NSIF / NHIF)**

| Item | Authority | Mandatory for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National Pensions and Social Insurance Fund (NSIF) | Ministry of Insurance and Social Development | All employers with employees |
| National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) | Federal Ministry of Health | All employers with employees |

See `sd-payroll-social` for full contribution mechanics.

## Section 7 — Sectoral licensing

Different sectors require specific pre-registration approvals:

**Sectoral licensing**

| Sector | Approving body | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Banking and Finance** | Central Bank of Sudan (Bank of Sudan) | Banking license; capital adequacy requirements; subject to specific contribution rates under Central Bank supervision |
| **Oil and Gas / Petroleum** | Ministry of Petroleum and Gas | Production Sharing Agreement (PSA); BPT 30% statutory; specific PSA terms per concession |
| **Telecommunications** | National Telecommunications Commission | Special VAT rate (40%) applies |
| **Insurance** | Ministry of Insurance and Social Development / Insurance Supervisory Authority | Insurance Supervisory Board approval |
| **Manufacturing / Industrial** | Ministry of Industry and Trade | Industrial license |
| **Agriculture** | Ministry of Agriculture | Agricultural land use approval |
| **Mining / Minerals** | Ministry of Minerals | Special mineral production sharing regimes |
| **Pharmaceuticals / Healthcare** | Federal Ministry of Health, National Medicines and Poisons Board | Medical professional licensing |
| **Education / Professional services** | Relevant ministry | Professional licensing per specialty |
| **Free Zones** | Sudan Free Zones Authority | Free Zones Act 2001 |
| **Charitable / NGO** | Humanitarian Affairs Commission | Registration for tax-exempt charitable bodies |

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Sectoral licensing often precedes Commercial Registrartion for foreign-owned entities. Application timelines for banking and petroleum sectors commonly take 3-6 months.

## Section 8 — Free Zones

### Free Zones Act / framework

- Free zones established under the Free Zones Authority / Investment Incentive Law 2021
- Free Trade Zones and Industrial Free Zones are the two main categories
- Multiple zones operational in Sudan (Port Sudan, several inland sites)

### Key incentives

- **Customs exemptions** on imports of capital equipment, raw materials for export production
- **Corporate income tax exemption** up to 5 years from commercial production date
- **VAT exemption** on capital equipment (list approved by Ministry of Investment and International Cooperation)
- Streamlined administrative procedures
- Cap on land allocation for projects

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Exemption is time-limited. Track the commercial production start date — the cap applies from there, not from registration.

See `sd-corporate-income-tax` for full free zone tax treatment.

## Section 9 — Annual obligations

### Annual return and renewal

**Annual return and renewal**

| Obligation | Frequency | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Commercial Registry renewal | Annual | Companies Act / Commercial Registration Law |
| Tax return filing | Annual (BPT, capital gains, etc.) | Income Tax Act 1986, Art 38 |
| VAT return filing | Monthly (Form 3) | VAT Regulations 2017 |
| PAYE remittance | Monthly | Income Tax Act 1986 |
| NSIF contribution remittance | Monthly | Social Insurance Act 2016 |
| Audited financial statements | Annual | Companies Act; required for "most companies" |
| Books and records retention | 6 years minimum | Income Tax Act 1986, Art 39(3-5) |

### Audit requirement

Most companies must have financial statements audited by a licensed Sudanese chartered accountant. Audit and submit with the annual return within the prescribed period.

*(Income Tax Act 1986, Art 38/39)*

### Charter requirements

A chartered accountant for tax purposes must be:
- Authorized in writing by the Minister to act as a chartered accountant for the Income Tax law
- Persons leaving Taxation Chamber positions may engage in consulting after 15+ years of service and a university degree *(Income Tax Act 1986)*

## Section 10 — Refusal catalogue

For the formation agent / accountant reviewing the engagement:

- **R-SD-FORM-1** — Do not advise on formation for any sanctioned industry or restricted activity without first confirming it is permitted in Sudan.
- **R-SD-FORM-2** — Do not promise specific timelines for sector-licensed industries (banking, petroleum, telecom).
- **R-SD-FORM-3** — Do not recommend a particular entity type without considering both sector and ownership structure (foreign vs local).
- **R-SD-FORM-4** — Do not assume the SDG 1,200,000 VAT threshold applies to current-period filings without currency-redenomination verification.
- **R-SD-FORM-5** — Do not prepare documents (MOA, AOA) without signed engagement and receipt of all shareholder ID documentation.
- **R-SD-FORM-6** — Do not assume LLC "no minimum capital" applies in practice — some banks require minimum paid-in capital for opening corporate accounts.
