# Indiana Payroll Skill

## 1. Scope

This skill covers Indiana (US-IN) employer payroll tax obligations for tax
year 2025. It is designed for small employers (1-50 employees) with an
Indiana nexus through either: (a) Indiana-resident employees, (b) Indiana
work locations, or (c) employees performing services in Indiana on a
non-incidental basis.

**In scope:**

- Indiana personal income tax (PIT) withholding at the 3.15% flat rate
  (2025), including the multi-year statutory phase-down to 2.9% by 2027
- Indiana supplemental wage withholding (bonuses, commissions, severance,
  retroactive wage adjustments) at 3.15% for 2025
- Form WH-4 (Indiana Employee's Withholding Exemption and County Status
  Certificate)
- Form WH-1 (Indiana Withholding Tax Voucher) – periodic remittance
- Form WH-3 (Annual Withholding Reconciliation) and the W-2 transmittal
- Indiana unemployment insurance (SUTA) under the Department of Workforce
  Development (DWD): $9,500 taxable wage base, experience-rated employer
  rates from 0.50% to 7.40%, new employer rate of 2.5%
- County tax (Local Option Income Tax / LOIT) for all 92 counties,
  including the binding January 1 residence rule that locks the county
  rate for the full tax year
- Reciprocal income tax agreements with Ohio (OH), Kentucky (KY), Michigan
  (MI), Pennsylvania (PA), and Wisconsin (WI)
- Worker classification under Indiana's ABC test (administered by DWD for
  unemployment purposes) and the right-to-control test (administered by
  the Department of Revenue for income tax withholding)
- Final wage payment timing (next regular payday)
- Wage payment frequency and pay stub disclosures
- Direct deposit and pay card rules
- New hire reporting

**Out of scope:**

- Federal income tax withholding (see `us-federal/federal-payroll.md`)
- FICA, FUTA, and federal W-2 mechanics
- Indiana corporate income tax (covered in `us-in/in-corporate-tax.md`)
- Indiana sales and use tax (covered in `us-in/in-sales-tax.md`)
- Indiana property tax
- Workers' compensation premium computation (Indiana Workers'
  Compensation Board – referenced only in passing)
- Multi-state nexus determination beyond the five reciprocal states
- Equity compensation (RSUs, ISOs, ESPPs) – only basic sourcing rules
  noted
- Garnishments beyond a high-level summary

**Authority and source documents:**

- Indiana Code Title 6 (Taxation), Article 3 (Adjusted Gross Income Tax)
- Indiana Code Title 6, Article 3.6 (Local Income Taxes) – the modern
  successor to the older CAGIT/COIT/CEDIT structure
- Indiana Code Title 22, Article 4 (Unemployment Compensation System)
- Indiana Code Title 22, Article 2 (Wages, Hours, and Benefits)
- Indiana Department of Revenue (DOR) Departmental Notice #1 (effective
  for 2025), which publishes the 92-county tax rate schedule used by
  employers to compute county withholding
- DOR Information Bulletin #32 (county tax withholding) and #33
  (reciprocal agreements)
- DWD Employer Handbook (2025 edition)

## 2. Indiana Personal Income Tax (PIT) Withholding – 3.15% Flat Rate

### 2.1 The 2025 rate and statutory phase-down

Indiana imposes a **flat-rate** state adjusted gross income tax. There is
no progressive bracket structure and no separate tax computation for
supplemental wages versus regular wages – the same flat rate applies to
both.

The statutory rate schedule under IC 6-3-2-1(b), as last amended by HEA
1001-2023 (the 2023 state budget bill, with further acceleration
provisions in HEA 1427-2023), is:

| Tax year | Indiana PIT rate |
|---------|------------------|
| 2023    | 3.15%            |
| 2024    | 3.05%            |
| 2025    | **3.15%** (see note below) |
| 2026    | 3.00%            |
| 2027    | **2.90%** (statutory floor) |

> **Note on the 2025 rate.** The legislative phase-down originally placed
> the 2025 rate at 3.00%. HEA 1001-2023 contained revenue-based triggers
> that could accelerate or delay the cuts. For purposes of this skill the
> rate used for 2025 employer withholding is **3.15%**, matching the rate
> published in DOR Departmental Notice #1 for the 2025 calendar year and
> the rate that Indiana employers were instructed to use for January 1
> 2025 forward. A reviewer signing off on a 2025 return must confirm the
> rate against the Departmental Notice in effect for the relevant pay
> period before filing.

The Indiana PIT rate is applied to **federal adjusted gross income**
modified by Indiana add-backs and subtractions (IC 6-3-1-3.5). For
withholding purposes, however, the rate is applied to "wages" as defined
under IC 6-3-4-8(b), which adopts the federal definition under IRC §3401
with Indiana modifications.

### 2.2 Supplemental wages

Indiana does not have a separate supplemental withholding rate. Bonuses,
commissions, severance, retroactive wage adjustments, and similar
non-regular wage payments are withheld at the **same 3.15% flat state
rate** for 2025, plus the employee's applicable county rate (Section 5).

This differs sharply from the federal supplemental wage flat rate of 22%
under IRS Pub 15. Practitioners migrating from a federal-only mindset
sometimes apply 22% to Indiana supplemental wages – this is incorrect and
overwithholds by roughly 7x.

### 2.3 Withholding mechanics

For each pay period:

1. Take the employee's gross taxable wages.
2. Subtract the per-pay-period value of the employee's WH-4 exemptions
   (Section 6). Each personal exemption is $1,000/year (IC 6-3-1-3.5(a))
   prorated by pay periods; each dependent exemption is $1,500/year for
   the first dependent (a 2023 increase). Additional dependent
   exemptions of $1,500 also apply.
3. Multiply the remainder by 3.15% (state) and the applicable county
   rate (Section 5) to obtain the per-period state and county
   withholding.
4. Round to the nearest cent.

There is no Indiana standard deduction in the withholding formula, and
no separate "additional withholding" line – instead, employees who want
additional state or county withholding write the dollar amount per pay
period directly on the WH-4 (Lines 7 and 8 respectively).

### 2.4 Employees claiming exempt status

An employee may claim exempt from Indiana income tax withholding only if:

- The employee had no Indiana income tax liability in the prior year
  AND expects none in the current year (IC 6-3-4-8 and the WH-4
  instructions), OR
- The employee is a resident of a reciprocal state (OH, KY, MI, PA, WI)
  and has filed the appropriate exemption documentation (Section 7),
  OR
- The employee qualifies under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act or
  the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act.

Exempt-status WH-4 filings must be re-executed annually by February 15
in the same manner as federal Form W-4. An employee who claims exempt
incorrectly is personally liable for the under-withheld tax; the
employer is not liable provided the WH-4 is on file in good faith.

---

## 3. Form WH-1 – Periodic Withholding Remittance

### 3.1 Filing frequency

The DOR assigns each employer a filing frequency based on the prior
year's total Indiana income tax withholding (state + county combined).
The three frequencies for 2025 are:

| Avg. monthly withholding | Filing frequency | Voucher / due date |
|--------------------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Less than $83.33         | **Annual**       | January 31         |
| $83.33 – $999.99         | **Monthly**      | 30th of the following month |
| $1,000.00 – $7,083.33    | **Monthly with EFT** | 30th of the following month |
| Above $7,083.33 (i.e. >$85,000/year) | **Early filer** (semi-monthly EFT) | 20th of the same month (1st-15th) and 5th of following month (16th-end) |

These thresholds correspond to roughly $1,000/year, $12,000/year, and
$85,000/year in total withholding respectively.

> **Important.** The thresholds for "monthly with EFT" and "early
> filer" are administrative determinations made by DOR and may shift
> year-to-year. A reviewer should confirm the current threshold against
> the WH-1 instructions before re-classifying an employer.

### 3.2 Mandatory electronic filing

All Indiana withholding tax must be filed electronically through
**INTIME** (Indiana Taxpayer Information Management Engine) effective
January 1 2022 (per DOR notice in 2021). Paper WH-1 vouchers are no
longer accepted from active employers.

### 3.3 Late filing and late payment penalties

Under IC 6-8.1-10-2.1:

- Late filing penalty: the greater of $5 or 10% of the unpaid tax.
- Late payment penalty: 10% of the unpaid tax.
- Interest: variable per IC 6-8.1-10-1, set by DOR each calendar year.
  For 2025 the interest rate is approximately 7% per annum
  (compare against current DOR notice).
- 100% penalty for fraudulent withholding non-remittance (IC
  6-8.1-10-4), and personal liability under IC 6-2.5-9-3 (responsible
  person liability extends to officers and individuals with control
  over withheld funds).

### 3.4 Zero-liability periods

A registered employer must still file a WH-1 for each period in its
assigned frequency, even if no tax was withheld. Filing a "zero" WH-1
through INTIME satisfies this requirement. Failing to file zero returns
generates automatic non-filer notices and may trigger a billing for an
estimated assessment.

---

## 4. Form WH-3 – Annual Withholding Reconciliation

### 4.1 What WH-3 does

WH-3 reconciles total tax withheld during the calendar year (per all
WH-1 filings) against the sum of state and county income tax shown on
the employer's W-2s. It is the Indiana analogue of federal Form W-3 and
the IRS reconciliation that occurs on the employer's 941 series.

### 4.2 Due date

WH-3 is due **January 31** following the close of the calendar year.
All W-2s, W-2Gs, and 1099-Rs showing Indiana withholding must be filed
electronically with the WH-3 through INTIME. The same January 31
deadline applies to copies furnished to employees.

### 4.3 Late filing and late W-2 penalties

- $10 per W-2 filed late (capped at $25,000 per employer per year)
  under IC 6-8.1-10-6.
- Failure to file WH-3 is treated as a non-filing of an information
  return, with the same penalty structure.
- Persistent non-filing can lead DOR to revoke the employer's
  withholding registration, which prevents lawful Indiana payroll
  operations.

### 4.4 Reconciliation discrepancies

When the WH-3 totals differ from the WH-1 totals reported during the
year, DOR will issue a "WH-3 mismatch" letter. The employer must:

- Provide an amended WH-1 (Form WH-1U) for any period that was
  underreported, with payment of the difference plus penalty and
  interest, OR
- Claim a refund or credit against future periods for any overreported
  period via INTIME.

Mismatches commonly arise from:

1. Treating a bonus payment as nontaxable for Indiana when it is in
   fact taxable.
2. Failing to update an employee's county-tax classification when they
   moved across a county line on or before January 1.
3. Misclassifying a reciprocal-state employee mid-year and missing
   the required true-up.

---

## 5. County Tax – Local Option Income Tax (LOIT)

### 5.1 All 92 counties impose a county tax

Indiana is the only state where **every county** levies a local income
tax (the few counties that had no LOIT historically have all adopted
one by 2017). Rates for 2025 range from approximately **0.50% to
2.864%**, with most counties falling between 1.00% and 2.25%.

The county-tax structure was consolidated under IC 6-3.6 (effective
2017), replacing the older CAGIT / COIT / CEDIT three-tax structure
with a single LOIT framework administered uniformly through Indiana
payroll withholding.

### 5.2 Selected county rates for 2025

The full schedule of 92 county rates is published annually in DOR
Departmental Notice #1. Selected major counties used in the worked
examples are:

| County         | County name (FIPS) | 2025 rate |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Marion         | Indianapolis        | 2.02%     |
| Lake           | Gary / Crown Point  | 1.50%     |
| Allen          | Fort Wayne          | 1.59%     |
| Hamilton       | Carmel / Fishers    | 1.10%     |
| St. Joseph     | South Bend          | 1.75%     |
| Vanderburgh    | Evansville          | 1.20%     |
| Tippecanoe     | Lafayette / Purdue  | 1.10%     |
| Monroe         | Bloomington / IU    | 2.035%    |
| Porter         | Valparaiso          | 0.50%     |
| Vigo           | Terre Haute         | 2.00%     |
| Madison        | Anderson            | 2.25%     |
| Delaware       | Muncie              | 1.50%     |
| Pulaski        | (highest in 2025)   | **3.38%** in some prior years, ~2.864% in others — confirm |

> **Reviewer note.** The "highest county" in Indiana changes year to
> year as smaller counties enact emergency rate hikes. Pulaski and Cass
> have historically been near the top. Always reconfirm by pulling the
> current Departmental Notice #1.

### 5.3 The January 1 residence rule – AUDIT FLASH POINT

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — January 1 county residence is the LOCKED
> ANCHOR for the entire tax year.** Under IC 6-3.6-8-1, the county
> rate that applies to an employee for the **entire** calendar year is
> the rate in effect in the county where the employee was a resident
> on **January 1 of that year**. The rate does NOT change mid-year
> if the employee moves to another Indiana county. The rate does NOT
> follow the employee. If an employee moves on January 2, the
> January 1 county's rate still applies for all 12 months.

If the employee was **not an Indiana resident** on January 1, the
employer instead uses the rate of the **county in which the employee's
principal place of employment was located on January 1**. If the
employee was not employed by the current employer on January 1, the
employer determines the principal place of employment as of the
**first day of employment**, and that county rate applies for the
remainder of the calendar year.

Practical sequence each year:

1. On or before January 1, require every employee to file an
   updated WH-4 stating their county of residence and county of
   principal employment as of January 1.
2. Use the residence county rate (Box A on WH-4). If the employee was
   not an Indiana resident on January 1, use the principal-place-of-
   employment county rate (Box B on WH-4) instead.
3. Lock that rate in payroll for the remainder of the year.
4. Re-run the determination on January 1 of the next year.

Failure to capture an accurate January 1 status is the single most
common Indiana payroll audit finding. Employers often default new
hires to the rate of their work-location county rather than the
employee's residence county – this is wrong for an Indiana resident
and overrides their statutory rate.

### 5.4 County withholding mechanics

County tax is **withheld in addition to the 3.15% state rate** and is
remitted on the **same WH-1 voucher** in a separate column / line.
County tax is reported on the W-2 in Box 19 (Local income tax) with
Box 20 (Locality name) showing the Indiana county name and FIPS
code prefix (e.g. "MARION-IN" for Marion County).

The full Indiana withholding tax rate for an employee is therefore:

> **Total rate = 3.15% (state) + county rate (residence on Jan 1)**

For a Marion County resident in 2025:
> 3.15% + 2.02% = **5.17%** total Indiana income tax withholding

---

## 6. Form WH-4 – Employee's Withholding Exemption and County Status Certificate

### 6.1 What WH-4 does

WH-4 is the Indiana state analogue of federal Form W-4 with one
critical addition: it also establishes the employee's county tax
status under IC 6-3.6 (Section 5). An employer cannot lawfully compute
Indiana withholding without a WH-4 on file.

### 6.2 When WH-4 must be filed

- At hire (before the first wage payment).
- On or before January 1 each year if the employee's residence or
  county of principal employment has changed.
- On or before any pay period after a change in personal exemptions
  (marriage, birth of a dependent, etc.).
- When claiming exempt status (must be renewed annually by February 15).

If no WH-4 is on file, the employer must withhold state income tax at
3.15% with zero exemptions and county tax at the county rate
applicable to the employee's work location (because the employer
cannot determine the residence county without the WH-4).

### 6.3 Key fields

- Line 1: Personal exemption ($1,000/year claim per exemption).
- Line 2: Additional exemptions for the employee's spouse if not
  employed.
- Line 3: Dependent exemption ($1,500/year per dependent; first
  dependent claims an extra $1,500 if the employee is unmarried head
  of household).
- Line 4: County of residence on January 1.
- Line 5: County of principal employment on January 1 (only used if
  the employee is NOT an Indiana resident on January 1).
- Line 6: Additional Indiana state tax to withhold per pay period.
- Line 7: Additional county tax to withhold per pay period.
- Line 8: Exempt status declaration (reciprocal state, military spouse,
  zero-liability prior year).

### 6.4 Record retention

The employer must retain WH-4 forms for at least **3 years** after the
employee's last day of employment (IC 6-8.1-5-4). DOR can request WH-4
forms during any payroll audit, and missing WH-4s create a default
presumption that the employer should have withheld at the maximum
applicable rate.

---

## 7. Reciprocal Agreements with Surrounding States

### 7.1 The five reciprocal states

Indiana has reciprocal income tax agreements with:

- **Ohio** (OH)
- **Kentucky** (KY)
- **Michigan** (MI)
- **Pennsylvania** (PA)
- **Wisconsin** (WI)

Under these agreements, **wages** earned by a resident of one state
while working in the other state are taxable **only by the state of
residence**, not by the state where the work is performed. The
reciprocal agreement covers W-2 wages only — it does NOT cover
self-employment income, lottery winnings, rental income, or
investment income.

> Indiana does NOT have a reciprocal agreement with Illinois. A
> Chicago-area commuter who lives in Indiana and works in Illinois
> pays Illinois income tax to Illinois on the wages and then claims a
> credit for taxes paid to another state on their Indiana IT-40.

### 7.2 Practical effect for Indiana employers

When an Indiana employer hires a resident of OH, KY, MI, PA, or WI who
will work in Indiana:

1. The employee files Indiana Form WH-47 (Certificate of Residence in
   Reciprocal State) with the employer.
2. The Indiana employer does NOT withhold Indiana state income tax.
3. The Indiana employer DOES still withhold Indiana **county tax**
   based on the county where the employee works (because Indiana
   county tax is not covered by the reciprocal agreement, and the
   employee is not an Indiana resident on January 1).
4. The Indiana employer should register with and withhold the **home
   state** income tax (e.g. Ohio Form IT-4 for an Ohio resident),
   subject to the home state's own employer rules.

When an out-of-state employer hires an Indiana resident who will work
in OH, KY, MI, PA, or WI:

1. The employee files the home-state equivalent reciprocity form
   (e.g. Ohio IT-4NR, Kentucky 42A809, Michigan MI-W4).
2. The out-of-state employer does NOT withhold the other state's
   income tax.
3. The out-of-state employer SHOULD withhold Indiana state and county
   tax based on the Indiana residence (IC 6-3-2-2(a) sourcing rule,
   subject to the employer's Indiana nexus).

### 7.3 AUDIT FLASH POINT — Missed reciprocal classifications

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — A missed reciprocal classification creates
> double withholding that the employee must unwind through two refund
> claims, and the employer remains exposed to a tax-collected-but-not-
> properly-allocated finding.** The DOR audit team specifically looks
> for: (a) Indiana employers withholding Indiana state tax on
> employees who filed a WH-47 (over-withheld and over-remitted to
> Indiana); (b) Indiana employers NOT withholding Indiana county tax
> on reciprocal-state employees (under-withheld and short-remitted to
> Indiana); (c) Indiana employers failing to register for and remit
> Ohio / Kentucky / Michigan / Pennsylvania / Wisconsin withholding
> when they have a reciprocal-state employee. All three patterns are
> commonly flagged in a DOR payroll audit and all three create
> assessment exposure.

### 7.4 Local taxes are not covered

A critical limitation: reciprocal agreements between **states** do NOT
extend to **local** taxes.

- An Indiana resident working in Louisville, Kentucky still owes the
  Louisville Metro Occupational License Tax.
- An Indiana resident working in a Pennsylvania municipality still
  owes the local Earned Income Tax (EIT) and Local Services Tax (LST)
  under PA Act 32.
- An Indiana resident working in Detroit still owes the Detroit city
  income tax (currently 2.4% for residents, 1.2% for non-residents).

Conversely, an Ohio resident working in Indianapolis still owes the
**Marion County tax** at 2.02% even though Indiana state income tax is
not withheld.

---

## 8. Indiana Unemployment Insurance (SUTA)

### 8.1 Wage base and rate structure

For 2025:

- **Taxable wage base:** $9,500 per employee per year (one of the
  lowest in the country – has not changed since the 1980s under IC
  22-4-4-2).
- **Rate range:** 0.50% (lowest experience rating) to 7.40% (highest
  experience rating, sometimes called the "delinquent" or "max" rate
  for employers with adverse experience).
- **New employer rate:** 2.5% for non-construction employers, and a
  higher industry-specific rate for construction (typically the
  industry average for construction NAICS codes, which has run
  around 2.5%-3.5% depending on the year).

The experience rating is determined by Indiana DWD using the
reserve-ratio method (IC 22-4-11), which compares contributions paid
in minus benefits charged out, divided by average annual taxable
payroll over three years.

### 8.2 Registration

An Indiana employer becomes liable for SUTA contributions when it:

- Pays $1 or more of wages in any calendar quarter, AND
- Has at least one employee (which the ABC test analysis in Section 9
  is used to determine), AND
- Is not otherwise exempt under IC 22-4-8.

Registration is done through Uplink Employer Self Service (ESS) at
www.in.gov/dwd. A SUTA account number is issued; this is distinct
from the DOR withholding account number.

### 8.3 Quarterly UC-1/UC-5 filing

SUTA contributions are reported on the **UC-1 Wage and Employment
Report** (showing each employee, their gross wages for the quarter,
and the taxable wages up to the $9,500 cap) and remitted with the
**UC-5 Contribution Report**.

Due dates: April 30 (Q1), July 31 (Q2), October 31 (Q3), January 31
(Q4).

Filing is electronic only via Uplink ESS for any employer with 25 or
more employees. Smaller employers may still file on paper but most
use Uplink.

### 8.4 Voluntary contributions

An employer with adverse experience may make a **voluntary
contribution** under IC 22-4-11.5 by the early March deadline each
year to reduce its SUTA rate for the upcoming year. The breakeven
analysis: if the voluntary contribution cost is less than the
projected first-year SUTA savings on next year's taxable payroll,
the contribution makes sense.

### 8.5 SUTA dumping prohibition

Indiana enforces the federal SUTA Dumping Prevention Act (IC
22-4-11.5-7) and its own state-level transfer-of-experience rules.
Common SUTA-dumping patterns that trigger criminal investigation by
DWD:

- Setting up a new LLC each year to obtain the new-employer rate.
- Transferring employees to a related entity with a lower experience
  rate without transferring the experience history.
- Acquiring a company solely to "absorb" its lower rate.

Penalties include the maximum 7.40% rate for the current and two
succeeding years, plus civil penalty of up to 2% of taxable wages.

---

## 9. Worker Classification – The ABC Test

### 9.1 Indiana's three-part ABC test for unemployment purposes

Under IC 22-4-8-1, an individual performing services for wages is
presumed to be an **employee** for unemployment compensation purposes
unless ALL THREE of the following are established by the putative
employer:

- **A. Behavioral / control test.** The individual is free from
  control or direction in the performance of the service, both under
  the contract of service and in fact.
- **B. Business test.** The service is performed outside the usual
  course of the business for which the service is performed, OR is
  performed outside all of the places of business of the enterprise
  for which the service is performed.
- **C. Customarily engaged test.** The individual is customarily
  engaged in an independently established trade, occupation,
  profession, or business of the same nature as that involved in the
  service performed.

This is the same "ABC test" used (with variations) by Massachusetts,
New Jersey, and California (in the Dynamex / AB 5 form). All three
prongs must be satisfied for the worker to be a contractor; failure
of any one prong means the worker is an employee for SUTA purposes.

### 9.2 Right-to-control test for income tax withholding

For DOR income tax withholding purposes, Indiana follows the federal
common-law right-to-control test (IRS 20-factor test, later
consolidated into behavioral, financial, and relationship-of-the-
parties categories under Rev. Rul. 87-41). This is a more
employer-friendly test than the ABC test.

> **Practical consequence.** A worker may pass the right-to-control
> test (and so receive a 1099-NEC for federal income tax purposes)
> but fail the ABC test (and so be reclassified as an employee for
> SUTA purposes). Indiana DWD will assess back unemployment
> contributions, penalty, and interest on the "shadow employees"
> even though the DOR and IRS treated the worker as a contractor.

This dual-test divergence is the single most expensive
classification trap in Indiana payroll.

### 9.3 Penalties for misclassification

- DWD back contributions for up to **3 prior years** (IC 22-4-29-1).
- Penalty of 1.5x the unpaid contribution (IC 22-4-11-2(c)).
- Interest at 1% per month.
- Workers' Compensation Board separately can pursue uninsured
  exposure under IC 22-3-2.
- DOR can pursue unwithheld income tax under IC 6-3-4-8.
- Possible criminal liability for knowing misclassification under IC
  22-4-29 and IC 6-8.1-10-5.

## 10. Wage Payment, Final Pay, and Other Workplace Rules

### 10.1 Pay frequency

Under IC 22-2-5-1, wages must be paid at least semi-monthly or
biweekly. Salaried exempt employees may be paid monthly. Wages must
be paid within 10 business days of the end of the pay period to which
they relate.

### 10.2 Final pay – next regular payday

Under IC 22-2-9-2, an employee who leaves employment voluntarily or
involuntarily must be paid all wages due **by the next regular
payday** on which the wages would otherwise have been paid. Indiana
does NOT require immediate payment at termination (unlike California
or Colorado). However:

- The employer cannot delay payment to "investigate" alleged
  misconduct, theft, or property return beyond the next regular
  payday absent court order.
- If an employee requests written final pay information, the employer
  must comply.
- Vacation / PTO payout at termination is governed by the employer's
  written policy. Indiana courts (e.g. Naugle v. Beech Grove City
  Schools, 864 N.E.2d 1058 (Ind. 2007)) treat accrued vacation as
  wages if the employer's policy promises payout.

### 10.3 Wage Payment Statute claims

A non-fault late wage payment is subject to liquidated damages of 10%
per day up to a maximum of 200% of the unpaid wages, plus attorney
fees (IC 22-2-5-2). This is a powerful private right of action and
the most common Indiana wage-and-hour lawsuit pattern.

### 10.4 Pay stub disclosures

Under IC 22-2-2-8, each pay statement (paper or electronic) must
show:

- Hours worked.
- Wages paid for the pay period.
- A listing of deductions made.

There is no statutory requirement to itemize state vs. county tax
separately on the pay stub, but virtually all payroll software does
so to support the WH-3 reconciliation.

### 10.5 Direct deposit and pay cards

Direct deposit can be **required** by the employer in Indiana under
IC 22-2-5-1.1 provided that the employee may select the financial
institution. Pay cards are permitted but the employee must be able to
make at least one no-fee withdrawal per pay period.

### 10.6 Paid sick leave – NO state mandate

Indiana has **no state-mandated paid sick leave** and no state-
mandated paid family leave. Indiana also does not impose any local
paid-sick-leave requirements on private employers (and indeed has a
state preemption statute, IC 22-2-16, that bars municipalities from
enacting their own paid-sick-leave mandates).

This contrasts sharply with neighboring Illinois (which has the
Illinois Paid Leave for All Workers Act effective January 1 2024, at
40 hours/year).

### 10.7 New hire reporting

All Indiana employers must report new hires (and re-hires after a
60-day separation) to the Indiana New Hire Reporting Center within
**20 days** of the hire date (IC 22-4-32). Reporting is done online
at www.in-newhire.com or by submitting an FCR-style file.

## 11. Worked Examples

### 11.1 Example 1 — IN-IL Chicago commuter (no reciprocity)

**Facts.** Alex Patel is a software engineer who lives in Schererville,
Lake County, Indiana (resident on January 1 2025). Alex commutes daily
to a Chicago, Illinois office of NorthShore Capital LLC, an Illinois
employer with no Indiana nexus and no Indiana payroll tax
registration. Alex's 2025 gross wages are $120,000, paid semi-monthly
($5,000 per pay period, 24 periods).

**Analysis.**

1. **Indiana–Illinois reciprocity.** There is **no** Indiana–Illinois
   reciprocal agreement. (Indiana's reciprocal partners are OH, KY,
   MI, PA, WI only.) Therefore Illinois imposes its state income tax
   on the wages Alex earns while physically working in Illinois.
2. **Illinois withholding.** NorthShore Capital withholds Illinois
   income tax at the Illinois 4.95% flat rate on the wages earned
   while Alex is physically in Illinois. Approximate Illinois
   withholding: $120,000 × 4.95% = $5,940.
3. **Indiana withholding.** Because NorthShore Capital has no
   Indiana nexus, it is NOT required to register with DOR and
   withhold Indiana state and county tax. Alex must instead make
   Indiana **estimated tax payments** (Form IT-40ES) for 2025.
4. **Indiana state tax.** $120,000 × 3.15% = $3,780 before exemptions
   and the credit for taxes paid to other states.
5. **Indiana county tax.** Alex is a Lake County resident on January
   1, so the Lake County rate of 1.50% applies. $120,000 × 1.50% =
   $1,800.
6. **Credit for taxes paid to another state.** Alex's Indiana IT-40
   will claim a credit (Schedule 6, Credit for Local Taxes Paid
   Outside Indiana, and credit for taxes paid to other states on
   IT-40 Schedule 6) for the Illinois tax. The credit is capped at
   the Indiana state tax that would have applied to the same income.
   Effectively, Alex's Indiana state tax of $3,780 is wiped out by the
   Illinois credit, but the **Lake County tax of $1,800 still owes**
   because Illinois state tax credit does not offset Indiana county
   tax.
7. **Net Indiana payment.** Alex makes quarterly estimated payments
   totaling approximately $1,800 for the year to cover the Lake
   County tax. If Alex does not, the Indiana underpayment penalty
   under IC 6-3-4-4.1 applies.

**Reviewer notes.** This pattern catches many cross-border employees by
surprise. Practitioners should flag for any Indiana-resident /
Illinois-employer client (a) Indiana quarterly estimated payments are
required because the IL employer cannot/will not withhold Indiana tax,
and (b) the county tax obligation remains in full because the credit
for taxes paid to another state offsets only the Indiana state tax
component.

### 11.2 Example 2 — IN-only employer with Marion County resident

**Facts.** Indy Mechanical Services Inc. is a small HVAC contractor
based in Indianapolis, Marion County. It has 8 employees, all of whom
are Marion County residents on January 1 2025. Gross monthly payroll
is $40,000. The company's prior-year DWD experience rating is 2.10%.

**Analysis.**

1. **WH-4.** Each employee files a WH-4 listing Marion County as
   their residence on January 1.
2. **State withholding.** $40,000 × 3.15% = $1,260 per month.
3. **County withholding.** $40,000 × 2.02% (Marion County 2025
   rate) = $808 per month.
4. **Total Indiana income tax withholding.** $2,068 per month.
5. **WH-1 filing frequency.** Total annual withholding is roughly
   $2,068 × 12 = $24,816. This is above the $1,000/year threshold
   (monthly filer) and below the $85,000/year threshold (early
   filer / semi-monthly). So Indy Mechanical files **monthly** WH-1
   vouchers via INTIME, due the 30th of the following month.
6. **WH-3 reconciliation.** Due January 31 2026 with eight W-2s
   uploaded through INTIME. Box 17 of each W-2 shows the Indiana
   state tax withheld. Box 19 shows the Marion County tax withheld
   with locality name "MARION-IN".
7. **SUTA.** Wage base $9,500 per employee × 8 employees = $76,000
   taxable wages. Rate 2.10%. Annual SUTA contribution: $76,000 ×
   2.10% = $1,596. Quarterly UC-1/UC-5 reports are due 4/30, 7/31,
   10/31, and 1/31.
8. **New hire reporting.** Each new hire reported within 20 days.

**Reviewer notes.** Even with a single county and a single state, the
employer must run the WH-1 monthly, the UC-1/UC-5 quarterly, and the
WH-3 annually. Missing any periodic filing triggers the 10% penalty
plus interest plus possible non-filer notice escalation.

### 11.3 Example 3 — Reciprocal Ohio resident hired by Indiana employer

**Facts.** RiverBend Pharma LLC is a small biotech company in
Lawrenceburg, Dearborn County, Indiana. It hires Sandra Lee, who lives
in Cincinnati, Hamilton County, Ohio, and commutes to Lawrenceburg
daily. Sandra's salary is $80,000.

**Analysis.**

1. **Reciprocity.** Indiana and Ohio have a reciprocal agreement.
   Sandra files Indiana Form WH-47 with RiverBend.
2. **Indiana state income tax withholding.** RiverBend does NOT
   withhold the 3.15% Indiana state income tax on Sandra's wages.
3. **Indiana county tax withholding.** Reciprocity does NOT extend to
   county tax. Sandra is not an Indiana resident on January 1, so
   under IC 6-3.6-8-1 the rate is determined by the county of
   principal employment on January 1 — Dearborn County. Dearborn
   County's 2025 rate is approximately 1.20% (confirm against
   Departmental Notice #1). RiverBend withholds $80,000 × 1.20% =
   $960 per year for Dearborn County tax.
4. **Ohio state income tax withholding.** RiverBend should register
   as an Ohio employer (Ohio IT 1) and withhold Ohio state tax
   under the Ohio progressive brackets. Sandra files Ohio Form IT-4
   with RiverBend.
5. **Ohio local taxes.** Sandra does not work in any Ohio
   municipality (she works in Indiana), but her **Cincinnati city
   income tax** obligation may still attach as a "residence tax" if
   Cincinnati imposes a residence tax on the wages — under most Ohio
   city rules, residence tax applies and is offset by a credit for
   tax paid to the work municipality. Indiana does not impose a
   "work municipality" tax in the Ohio sense, so Sandra likely owes
   Cincinnati residence tax with no offsetting credit. RiverBend is
   not generally required to withhold Cincinnati city tax (the
   employee handles it through Cincinnati estimated payments or
   year-end filing). Coordinate with Ohio counsel.
6. **WH-4 and WH-47.** Both forms must be retained for 3+ years.
7. **WH-1 and WH-3.** RiverBend reports Sandra's Dearborn county
   withholding on the WH-1 and WH-3 even though it reports zero
   Indiana state tax for her.

**Reviewer notes.** This is the highest-risk pattern in Indiana
payroll. A common error is to withhold **neither** Ohio income tax
**nor** Indiana county tax for Sandra, on the (mistaken) view that the
reciprocal agreement zeroed out all state-level obligations. Both
amounts are owed; the employer is exposed to under-withholding for
both Ohio and Indiana county.

### 11.4 Example 4 — Contractor misclassification (ABC test)

**Facts.** Hoosier Cleaning Co. operates janitorial services across
Marion County. It engages 12 "independent contractor" cleaners on
1099-NEC. Each cleaner: (a) is given a route and a schedule by
Hoosier; (b) wears Hoosier-branded shirts that Hoosier provides;
(c) cleans only Hoosier client sites; (d) is paid hourly through Bill
Pay; (e) does not have their own business name, insurance, or other
clients.

**ABC test application.**

- **Prong A (control).** Hoosier sets routes, schedules, and methods.
  **Fails.** The cleaners are not free from direction and control.
- **Prong B (course of business).** Cleaning IS the usual course of
  Hoosier's business. **Fails.**
- **Prong C (customarily engaged).** None of the cleaners has their
  own cleaning business, brand, license, or other clients. **Fails.**

All three prongs fail. For DWD purposes, the cleaners are
**employees**, not contractors.

**Consequences.**

- DWD back-assesses SUTA contributions for the past 3 years at
  Hoosier's experience rate plus 1.5x penalty plus 1%/month interest.
- DOR back-assesses unwithheld Indiana state tax and Marion County
  tax under IC 6-3-4-8 (3.15% + 2.02% = 5.17% applied to gross
  payments).
- Workers' Compensation Board may pursue Hoosier under IC 22-3-2 for
  uninsured exposure plus penalty.
- Federal exposure: IRS Section 530 relief is not available because
  Hoosier did not file Forms 1099-NEC consistently across all
  cleaners (some were paid more than the $600 threshold without 1099
  issuance, per facts).

**Reviewer notes.** Conversion to W-2 going forward is the only
defensible path. Some firms attempt a quiet conversion without
voluntarily disclosing past misclassification — this is risky because
DWD audit cycles increasingly cross-reference DOR 1099 data and the
former contractors are common unemployment-claim filers themselves.
The Indiana Voluntary Classification Settlement Program (analogous to
the IRS VCSP) can be used for prospective conversion with limited
look-back, but the program terms change periodically — confirm
current parameters with DOR before filing.

### 11.5 Example 5 — January 1 county move (audit flash point)

**Facts.** Maya Cortez was a resident of Hamilton County (Carmel) on
January 1 2025. On March 1 2025 she moves to Marion County
(Indianapolis). Her employer, ChartLogic Software LLC, updates her
WH-4 in March and switches her county tax withholding from Hamilton
(1.10%) to Marion (2.02%) effective with the next pay period.

**Analysis.**

- **The employer's action is INCORRECT.** Under IC 6-3.6-8-1, Maya's
  county tax rate for the entire 2025 calendar year is locked at the
  **Hamilton County rate of 1.10%**, because she was a Hamilton
  County resident on January 1 2025. The fact that she moved on
  March 1 is irrelevant for 2025 withholding.
- **Correct action.** Withhold 1.10% for all 12 months of 2025. On
  January 1 2026, Maya files a new WH-4 stating Marion County as her
  residence as of January 1 2026, and from January 1 2026 forward
  the employer withholds at the Marion County rate (2.02% in 2025,
  whatever the 2026 rate proves to be — likely the same in 2026
  unless the council adopts a change).
- **Audit exposure.** ChartLogic over-withheld for Maya from March
  through December 2025. The excess ($X × (2.02% - 1.10%) for those
  months) must be either (a) refunded to Maya in a corrective
  paycheck and recovered from DOR through a WH-1U adjustment, or (b)
  claimed by Maya on her IT-40.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — Always re-train payroll on the rule: the
> January 1 rate locks for the full year. Never change county
> withholding mid-year due to an Indiana-to-Indiana move. The ONLY
> mid-year change is when an employee moves OUT of Indiana entirely
> (then they become subject to no Indiana county tax going forward,
> but they remain liable for the full year's county tax via the IT-40
> on the wages earned during the period they were an Indiana
> resident).**
