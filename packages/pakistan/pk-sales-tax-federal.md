# Pakistan — Federal Sales Tax on Goods (FBR) — Skill v2.0

> **Scope.** This skill covers the **federal sales tax on goods** administered by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) under the Sales Tax Act 1990 (STA 1990) as amended by the Finance Act 2024 and the Finance Act 2025. It applies to manufacturers, importers, wholesalers, distributors, retailers (including Tier-1 retailers with mandatory POS integration), and other persons making **taxable supplies of goods** in or to Pakistan.
>
> **Out of scope.** Provincial sales tax on **services** (Sindh Revenue Board / SRB, Punjab Revenue Authority / PRA, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority / KPRA, Balochistan Revenue Authority / BRA, and Islamabad Capital Territory services tax administered by FBR) is handled by the companion skill `pk-sales-tax-services`. Federal Excise Duty (FED), customs duty, and income tax / withholding tax are also out of scope.

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the tax period (HBL, UBL, MCB, Allied, Bank Alfalah, Meezan, Standard Chartered Pakistan, Bank Al-Habib, Faysal, JS, Soneri, Askari, Habib Metro, Silk Bank, Summit; mobile wallets JazzCash, Easypaisa, NayaPay, SadaPay also acceptable). Client's NTN and STRN. Confirmation of registration status (manufacturer, importer, wholesaler, retailer Tier-1 / Tier-2, distributor, exporter).

**Recommended** — sales invoices (issued and received) showing supplier STRN, IRIS Annex-A pre-filled by FBR (the "purchase data" auto-loaded from counterparties' Annex-C), GDs (Goods Declarations) for imports/exports, POS data extract for Tier-1 retailers, prior period credit carry-forward statement, withholding sales tax certificates received.

**Ideal** — full sales/purchase ledgers in IRIS-ready format (CSV), bonded warehouse / EOU documentation if applicable, SROs being relied upon (with reference number and date), stock movement records, customs documents (Goods Declaration, Bill of Lading, Mate Receipt) for imports/exports, copies of withholding tax challans, debit/credit note register.

**Refusal if minimum missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement = hard stop. "Federal sales tax input credit requires the supplier invoice to appear in your Annex-A (auto-populated from the supplier's Annex-C filed on IRIS). Until verified on IRIS, all input credits in this working paper are provisional. Output tax must be reported regardless of supplier behaviour."

### Refusal catalogue

**R-PK-F-1 — Multiple tax authorities / split goods–services business.** "Federal sales tax (this skill) covers goods only. If the same business also supplies services in Sindh / Punjab / KP / Balochistan / ICT, those services require provincial filing via the companion skill `pk-sales-tax-services`. This skill will compute the federal portion only and flag service items for the provincial workflow."

**R-PK-F-2 — SRO-based manufacturing exemption / concessionary regime.** "Reduced rates and exemptions under SROs (Statutory Regulatory Orders) — e.g., textile zero-rating SROs, dairy SROs, pharma SROs, mobile phone CKD SROs — require gazette-level verification with the current text of the SRO at the date of supply. The skill will flag and compute under standard 18% unless the user provides the active SRO reference. Escalate to a Pakistani Chartered Accountant for definitive SRO interpretation."

**R-PK-F-3 — Withholding sales tax agent obligations.** "Designated withholding agents (federal/provincial government departments, autonomous bodies, public-sector companies, listed companies, distributors of specified sectors) must withhold sales tax at prescribed rates under the Sales Tax Special Procedure (Withholding) Rules 2007 and the Eleventh Schedule. Out of scope unless you provide the withholding register, SRO 660(I)/2007 applicability confirmation, and the list of suppliers from whom withholding has been deducted. Escalate."

**R-PK-F-4 — Export refund (Annex-H / FASTER / ERS).** "Export refund claims via Annex-H, FASTER (Fully Automated Sales Tax e-Refund), or the older Expeditious Refund System (ERS) require complete shipping documentation (GD, BL, mate receipt, e-form, foreign inward remittance), input invoice matching with Annex-A, and stock reconciliation. Refund computation and claim submission is out of scope — escalate. The skill can report zero-rated turnover in Annex-D and flag pending refund."

**R-PK-F-5 — Partial exemption / mixed taxable + exempt supplies.** "Where a person makes both taxable and exempt supplies (e.g., a manufacturer producing both pharma-exempt and taxable medical devices), input tax must be apportioned per §8(2) and the Apportionment of Input Tax Rules 1996. Requires full-year data to compute the residual input ratio. Out of scope — escalate."

**R-PK-F-6 — Tier-1 POS non-integration / penalty assessment.** "Persons meeting Tier-1 retailer thresholds (§2(43A) STA 1990) who are not integrated with FBR's POS system face turnover-based penalties and disallowance of input tax. Assessment of penalty exposure and remediation is out of scope. Escalate."

**R-PK-F-7 — Imported services reverse charge / digital services.** "Federal sales tax under STA 1990 is on **goods only**. Imported services (Google Ads, AWS, Meta, etc.) attract **provincial** sales tax on services (e.g., SRB has a reverse-charge rule) or federal **withholding tax on payments to non-residents** under the Income Tax Ordinance 2001. Neither is covered by this skill. Refer to `pk-sales-tax-services` and the income tax skill."

**R-PK-F-8 — Federal Excise Duty (FED) overlap.** "Certain goods (cement, sugar, aerated waters, tobacco, services in 'FED in VAT mode' regime) attract Federal Excise Duty in addition to or instead of sales tax. FED is out of scope — escalate to FED specialist."

**R-PK-F-9 — Combined / aggregated audits, scrutiny notices, show-cause notices.** "Responding to FBR audit / scrutiny / show-cause notices, RAU (Risk-Based Audit Unit) selections, post-refund audits, or DRAP-related inspections is professional advisory work — out of scope. Provide the client's correspondence to a licensed tax practitioner."

## Section 3 — Tier 1 — Registered persons, taxable supplies, input/output

### 3.1 Who must register

Mandatory registration under §14 STA 1990 and the Sales Tax Rules 2006:

- **Manufacturers** — no turnover threshold (any manufacturer is registrable).
- **Importers** — any person importing goods (registered automatically via WeBOC / PSW for customs purposes; STA registration also required for input/output reporting).
- **Wholesalers, dealers, distributors** — of taxable goods.
- **Tier-1 retailers** — see §2(43A): retailer falling in any of these categories: operating as a national/international chain ≥ specified outlets; located in air-conditioned mall, plaza or centre (excluding kiosks); electricity bill > PKR 1.2M / year in last 12 months; wholesaler-cum-retailer engaged in bulk import and supply of consumer goods; whose shop measures ≥1,000 sq ft (or 2,000 sq ft for furniture); or any other category notified by FBR.
- **Persons with annual turnover > PKR 10 million** (small retailers below this and below the Tier-1 thresholds may qualify for the Final Tax Regime via electricity bill — see Tenth Schedule).
- **Persons engaged in zero-rated supplies / exports** (registration enables refund).
- **Persons specifically notified by FBR** under SROs.

Voluntary registration is permitted for businesses below threshold who want to claim input credit on inputs sold onward to registered customers.

### 3.2 Taxable supply — what is in scope

Per §2(33) and §2(41) STA 1990, a "taxable supply" is a supply of taxable goods made by an importer, manufacturer, wholesaler, distributor, or retailer (other than a supply of goods exempt under §13 / Sixth Schedule) in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity. "Goods" include every kind of movable property other than actionable claims, money, stocks, shares and securities (§2(12)). It does **not** include services (covered by the provincial regime).

### 3.3 Time and value of supply

- **Time of supply** (§2(44)): the earlier of (a) delivery of goods; (b) issuance of invoice; (c) receipt of payment. For continuous supplies (e.g., electricity, gas), the time is the date specified on the bill.
- **Value of supply** (§2(46)): consideration in money received, including all federal/provincial duties and taxes excluding sales tax itself. Where consideration is non-monetary, the open-market value. For supplies between associated persons, the open-market value. Trade discounts allowed if shown on the invoice and in line with normal business practice.

### 3.4 Standard rate — 18%

Applies to all taxable supplies not falling under a reduced rate (Eighth Schedule), zero rate (Fifth Schedule), or exemption (Sixth Schedule). Increased from 17% to 18% by Finance Act 2024 effective 1 July 2024; retained at 18% by Finance Act 2025.

### 3.5 Output tax

Tax charged on outward supplies. Computed as:

`Output tax = Value of supply (excluding ST) × applicable rate`

If price is "inclusive of sales tax":

`Net value = Gross / (1 + rate)`
`Output tax = Gross − Net`

Output tax is reported invoice-wise in **Annex-C** of the STR.

### 3.6 Input tax and credit eligibility

Input tax under §7 STA 1990 may be deducted from output tax in the same tax period if **all** the following are met:

1. Purchase is for **taxable activity** (or zero-rated activity).
2. Invoice is from a **registered** supplier showing the supplier's **STRN**, the buyer's STRN, invoice serial, date, description, quantity, value, rate, and tax amount.
3. Invoice appears in the buyer's **Annex-A** as auto-populated from the supplier's filed Annex-C (or where Annex-A pre-population is overridden, the supplier's CPR is verifiable on IRIS).
4. Claim is made within **six (6) tax periods** from the issuance of the tax invoice (§7(1) proviso — limit may change by Finance Act; verify before each filing).
5. Input is **not blocked** (see §3.7 below).
6. For imports, the **Goods Declaration** is filed and customs duty + ST paid via PSW.

**Section 8B cap.** Adjustable input tax is capped at **90% of output tax** in any tax period (§8B STA 1990). Any excess input tax is carried forward to the next period. Specified sectors (e.g., certain registered manufacturers under SRO 1190(I)/2019) are exempt from §8B — check current SRO list.

### 3.7 Blocked input — non-creditable

Per §8 STA 1990, input tax is NOT allowed on:

- Goods used or consumed for **non-taxable** activities (private, exempt, etc.).
- Goods on which **extra tax** or **further tax** is paid (cannot be cascaded as input).
- **Passenger road vehicles** (except commercial vehicles for hire / transport of goods).
- **Building materials** used in immovable property construction (other than for sale of the building as a taxable supply by a registered builder).
- **Fake invoices** or invoices issued by **suspended / blacklisted** suppliers (Active Taxpayer List — ATL — check on IRIS before claiming).
- **Entertainment, food, beverages** consumed by employees / management (not for resale).
- Goods purchased from **unregistered persons** (no STRN, no invoice on IRIS).
- Goods not deposited in the **declared business premises** / stock register mismatched.

### 3.8 Invoice requirements (§23 STA 1990)

A "tax invoice" must show:

- Name, address, STRN of the supplier
- Name, address, STRN (if registered) of the buyer
- Date of issue
- Serial number (chronological, sequential)
- Description of goods, quantity, unit
- Value exclusive of tax
- Rate of tax (18%, 15%, 5%, etc.)
- Amount of tax
- Total invoice value
- For supplies to unregistered persons: the name and CNIC of the buyer (per §23(1)(b) for invoices > PKR 100,000 — threshold may vary by Finance Act)

Tier-1 retailers must issue **POS-integrated invoices** with QR code linking to FBR (real-time transmission).

### 3.9 Filing — monthly Sales Tax Return (STR)

Filed via IRIS by the **18th of the month** following the tax period (calendar month). Payment via CPR (Computerised Payment Receipt) typically by the **15th**, with the return filed by the 18th. Exact deadlines for any given period are published by FBR via SOP / circular — verify before each filing.

A nil return is required even if there are no transactions in the period (failure to file penalises the taxpayer and moves them off the Active Taxpayer List).

### 3.10 Penalties (Section 33 STA 1990 — summary)

| Default | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to file return on time | PKR 10,000 (or PKR 200/day, whichever higher) |
| Failure to issue tax invoice | PKR 10,000 or 5% of value, whichever higher |
| Failure to deposit tax due | PKR 10,000 or 5% of tax, whichever higher, + default surcharge |
| Default surcharge (interest) | **KIBOR + 3%** per annum on unpaid tax (§34) |
| Issuance of fake/flying invoice | PKR 25,000 or 100% of tax, + criminal liability (§37A) |
| Tier-1 retailer not POS-integrated | Disallowance of 60% input tax + monetary penalty |
| Failure to register | PKR 10,000 + 100% of tax sought to be evaded |
| Failure to file refund claim correctly | Refund delayed; no specific monetary penalty |

## Section 4 — Tier 2 — Tier-1 POS integration, Schedules, further/extra tax

### 4.1 Tier-1 retailers and POS integration

Since 2019/2020 (notified by FBR via SROs and Chapter XIV-AA of the Sales Tax Rules 2006), **Tier-1 retailers** as defined in §2(43A) STA 1990 must integrate their point-of-sale (POS) systems with FBR's real-time invoicing system.

**Definition of Tier-1 retailer (§2(43A))** — meets any one:
- Part of a national or international chain.
- Operates in air-conditioned mall, plaza, or centre (excluding kiosks).
- Cumulative electricity bill > **PKR 1.2 million / year**.
- Wholesaler-cum-retailer engaged in bulk import.
- Shop ≥ **1,000 sq ft** (or 2,000 sq ft for furniture).
- Other categories notified by FBR.

**Integration requirements:**
- Each sales invoice issued by a Tier-1 retailer must be transmitted in real time to FBR's POS server.
- Invoice must carry a **QR code** and **invoice number** generated by FBR.
- Customer can verify the invoice at FBR's "Tax Asaan" app or the FBR website.
- Customers receive a **5% prize / discount** under FBR's Prize Scheme on POS-verified invoices (subject to ongoing notification).

**Reduced rate for integrated Tier-1 retailers (selected items).** Per the Eighth Schedule and successive SROs, certain finished goods (e.g., specified textiles, leather articles) supplied by integrated Tier-1 retailers carry a reduced rate (historically **12%**, then **15%**; the rate has fluctuated — verify the current SRO at the date of supply). Non-integrated Tier-1 retailers do NOT qualify for the reduced rate and face input tax disallowance of **60%** of admissible input.

### 4.2 Fifth Schedule — Zero-rated supplies

Per §4 STA 1990 read with the **Fifth Schedule**, the following are charged at **0%** (allowing full input tax recovery / refund):

- Exports of goods (with shipping bill / GD evidence).
- Supplies to diplomats, diplomatic missions, privileged persons.
- Supplies of stores / provisions for consumption aboard conveyances proceeding outside Pakistan.
- Locally manufactured plant and machinery (where notified).
- Supplies to duty-free shops.
- Other items as listed and amended periodically by Finance Acts and SROs (e.g., previously included raw materials for export-oriented sectors — textile, leather, carpets, surgical, sports goods — this "zero-rating" was withdrawn in 2019 for domestic sales and is now confined to actual exports).

Zero-rating means the supplier charges 0% output tax, claims input credit on related purchases, and is entitled to a **refund** of net input tax via Annex-H / FASTER / ERS.

### 4.3 Sixth Schedule — Exempt supplies

Per §13 STA 1990 read with the **Sixth Schedule**, exempt items include:

- **Basic foodstuffs**: unprocessed wheat, rice, pulses, vegetables, fruits, fresh meat, fish, eggs, milk, edible oils where specified.
- **Pharmaceuticals**: many active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished medicines (subject to changes by Finance Acts; from 2024 some pharma went from zero-rated to exempt, restricting input credit recovery).
- **Agricultural inputs**: certain pesticides, seeds, tractors (where notified).
- **Educational items**: textbooks, exercise books, stationery (specified).
- **Health equipment**: certain medical devices, supplies for charitable hospitals.
- **Newsprint**: as notified.
- **Goods imported by international organisations** and diplomatic missions (Table-2).
- **Renewable energy items** (solar panels, wind turbines, batteries — coverage has varied; Finance Act 2024 brought some solar items back into the tax net; Finance Act 2025 again altered the position — verify current law before classification).

**Effect of exemption.** No output tax. **No input credit** on inputs attributable to exempt supplies. Where a person makes mixed taxable + exempt supplies, input is apportioned per the Apportionment of Input Tax Rules 1996.

### 4.4 Eighth Schedule — Reduced and concessionary rates

Per §3(2)(aa) STA 1990, the **Eighth Schedule** lists items taxed at rates other than 18%. Common reduced-rate items (rates change frequently — verify):

- **Mobile phones (CKD components / completely built up)** — fixed PKR amounts depending on value brackets.
- **Sugar (industrial use)** — 8% or other reduced rate.
- **Soybean meal, oilcake** — 10% or other.
- **Re-meltable iron / steel scrap** — fixed PKR / metric ton.
- **Locally manufactured electric vehicles** — concessionary rate.
- **Specified pharma raw materials** where re-classified out of exempt.
- **Certain dairy and milk products** — variable.

The Eighth Schedule is amended **every Finance Act**. Always consult the current consolidated Schedule on FBR's website before applying a reduced rate.

### 4.5 Ninth Schedule — Specified electronics / mobile phones (fixed tax)

The **Ninth Schedule** prescribes **fixed tax** in PKR per unit on imports / supplies of cellular mobile phones, computed by reference to the C&F value brackets. Tax is collected at import (by Customs) and at registration (by PTA / cellular operator). This is in addition to or in lieu of standard sales tax for these items.

### 4.6 Tenth Schedule — Retailer regime (small retailers)

Small retailers not falling within Tier-1 may opt into a **simplified regime** based on the monthly electricity bill, paying sales tax via the electricity bill collection mechanism (typically 5% or 7.5% of the electricity bill, capped at specified PKR amounts). This regime was introduced by Finance Act 2019/2020 and revised multiple times — verify the current rate slabs.

### 4.7 Further tax — 4% on supplies to unregistered persons (§3(1A))

Where a registered person makes a taxable supply to an **unregistered person**, the registered person must charge **further tax at 4%** in addition to the standard 18% (so effective 22% on the supply). Purpose: incentivise the buyer to register.

- **Not creditable** by anyone — it is a final tax on the supply chain.
- Shown on invoice as a separate line.
- Reported in the STR main return under "further tax payable".
- Not applicable to supplies to: government departments, exempt entities, end consumers below specified thresholds (verify current SRO exclusions).

### 4.8 Extra tax — Specified consumer goods to unregistered retailers

Per SROs (e.g., SRO 297(I)/2023 and successors), an **extra tax** (commonly 2% or 3%) applies on specified electrical home appliances, electronic goods, batteries, lubricant oils, and similar consumer items supplied to **unregistered retailers** by manufacturers / importers / commercial importers. This is in addition to standard ST and further tax. The rates and item lists are SRO-driven and change — verify before applying.

### 4.9 Withholding sales tax (Eleventh Schedule)

Designated withholding agents (federal/provincial government, autonomous bodies, public-sector companies, listed companies, and others notified) must withhold a portion of sales tax on payments to suppliers under the Sales Tax Special Procedure (Withholding) Rules 2007. Withheld amounts are deposited via CPR and credited to the supplier's STRN. The supplier accounts for full output tax and offsets the withheld amount in the STR.

Rates of withholding vary by category of supplier and goods (commonly 1/5th of the tax, 1/10th, or 100% — verify the Eleventh Schedule and current SRO).

### 4.10 Refund mechanisms (exporters and zero-rated)

- **FASTER** (Fully Automated Sales Tax e-Refund) — for **textile, leather, carpets, sports goods, surgical goods** — the "Five Zero-Rated Sectors". Refund processed automatically based on Annex-H data and Annex-A matching with suppliers' Annex-C.
- **ERS** — older system, still used for non-FASTER claims.
- **Annex-H** — refund claim filed monthly alongside the STR.
- **Time limit** — refund claim must be filed within **one year** of the date of payment of tax (§66 STA 1990).
- **Conditions** — input invoices verified, GD / BL / e-form confirmed, foreign inward remittance encashed, stock reconciliation OK.

### 4.11 Active Taxpayer List (ATL)

FBR publishes a weekly **Active Taxpayer List** (sales tax). Buying from a supplier **not on the ATL** disallows input credit. Always verify supplier ATL status before claiming input. Re-instatement on the ATL requires filing all overdue returns and payment of the "Surcharge for ATL" (a fixed amount currently PKR 20,000 for companies, PKR 10,000 for AOPs, PKR 1,000 for individuals — verify current Finance Act).

---

## Section 5 — Worked example

**Scenario.** A registered manufacturer of cotton garments in Karachi (Sindh) makes the following supplies in May 2026. Federal sales tax on goods is being computed (the business does not provide services, so no provincial filing is needed). The manufacturer is on the ATL and has been since 2022. Not a Tier-1 retailer (sells B2B and B2 manufactured-export).

### 5.1 Transactions for May 2026

| # | Date | Description | Counterparty | Counterparty status | Gross (PKR) | Direction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 03/05/2026 | Sale of cotton T-shirts | RETAILER A (Tier-1, registered, STRN 1234567-8) | Registered | 5,900,000 | Outflow → them |
| 2 | 07/05/2026 | Sale of cotton T-shirts | KIRYANA STORE B | Unregistered | 1,100,000 | Outflow → them |
| 3 | 12/05/2026 | Export of T-shirts to US importer (GD #KHI-EXP-2026-3344) | ACME USA INC | Foreign | 8,000,000 (USD inward) | Outflow → them |
| 4 | 15/05/2026 | Purchase of cotton yarn | YARN MILLS LTD (registered, STRN 7654321-2) | Registered | 4,720,000 | Inflow ← them |
| 5 | 18/05/2026 | Purchase of dyes & chemicals (imported) | Customs GD #KHI-IMP-2026-9988 | Customs | 1,180,000 ST paid at import | Inflow ← them |
| 6 | 20/05/2026 | Electricity bill (K-Electric) | K-ELECTRIC | Registered | 590,000 | Inflow ← them |
| 7 | 22/05/2026 | Purchase from a supplier later found suspended on ATL | XYZ TRADERS | Suspended | 944,000 | Inflow ← them |
| 8 | 28/05/2026 | Sale of fabric scrap | UNREGISTERED RECYCLER | Unregistered | 220,000 | Outflow → them |

### 5.2 Reasoning — line by line

**1. Sale to RETAILER A (registered):** Standard 18%. Gross PKR 5,900,000 includes ST. Net DPP = 5,900,000 / 1.18 = **5,000,000**. Output ST = **900,000**. No further tax (buyer registered). Reported in Annex-C with buyer's STRN.

**2. Sale to KIRYANA STORE B (unregistered):** Standard 18% + **further tax 4%** (total 22%). Gross PKR 1,100,000 includes both ST + further tax. Net DPP = 1,100,000 / 1.22 = **901,639.34**. Output ST (18%) = **162,295.08**. Further tax (4%) = **36,065.57**. Reported in Annex-C with buyer's CNIC (since gross > PKR 100,000); further tax shown separately in the main return. CNIC of buyer is mandatory for invoices > PKR 100,000 to unregistered persons (§23(1)(b)).

**3. Export to ACME USA INC:** Zero-rated under Fifth Schedule. Output ST = **0**. Reported in Annex-D with GD reference, BL, and inward remittance details. Input tax attributable to this supply is refundable via FASTER (textile is one of the five zero-rated sectors).

**4. Purchase of cotton yarn from YARN MILLS LTD (registered):** Standard 18%. Gross PKR 4,720,000 includes ST. Net = 4,720,000 / 1.18 = **4,000,000**. Input ST = **720,000**. Provided YARN MILLS LTD is on ATL and the invoice appears in Annex-A (pulled from YARN's Annex-C), input is claimable. Reported in Annex-A.

**5. Import of dyes & chemicals (PSW / Customs GD):** Sales tax paid at import via PSW. ST paid PKR 1,180,000. Net DPP at import = 1,180,000 / 0.18 = 6,555,556 (i.e., the DPP on which 18% gives 1,180,000 — but in this scenario the PKR 1,180,000 IS the ST paid, not the invoice gross; clarifying assumption: customs valuation gross PKR 6,555,556 + 18% ST PKR 1,180,000). Input ST = **1,180,000**. Provided GD is reflected in PSW/IRIS, fully claimable. Reported in Annex-A (imports section).

**6. Electricity bill (K-Electric, registered):** Standard 18%. Gross PKR 590,000 includes ST. Net = 590,000 / 1.18 = **500,000**. Input ST = **90,000**. K-Electric is registered (utility) and issues a tax invoice via the bill; appears in Annex-A. Reported in Annex-A.

**7. Purchase from XYZ TRADERS (later suspended on ATL):** Although an invoice was received, XYZ TRADERS is suspended on the ATL. Input tax of PKR 944,000 × 18/118 = PKR 144,000 is **disallowed** under §8(1)(ca) STA 1990 (purchase from non-active supplier). Treat as input = **0**. Flag the line in the working paper for the client to follow up with the supplier or the FBR.

**8. Sale of fabric scrap to UNREGISTERED RECYCLER:** Standard 18% + further tax 4%. Gross PKR 220,000 includes ST + further tax. Net = 220,000 / 1.22 = **180,327.87**. Output ST = **32,459.02**. Further tax = **7,213.11**. CNIC of buyer mandatory if gross > PKR 100,000 → mandatory here. Reported in Annex-C.

## Section 6 — Filing and payment

### 6.1 Filing channel — IRIS

All federal sales tax returns are filed via **IRIS** at https://iris.fbr.gov.pk. IRIS is FBR's integrated e-filing system (replaced earlier eFBR and standalone Sales Tax e-Filing portals). Login is via the registered NTN/STRN and IRIS password (with 2FA via SMS on the registered mobile number / iris-token app).

The monthly STR flow:

1. **Open Sales Tax Return → New return → Period (May 2026).**
2. **Annex-A** is auto-pre-populated with purchase invoices uploaded by the user's suppliers in their Annex-C. Reconcile differences (missing invoices, mismatched amounts, suspended suppliers).
3. **Annex-C** — upload sales invoices (manually, via CSV/Excel template, or via API for ERP-integrated taxpayers). Tier-1 retailers' POS-integrated invoices flow automatically into Annex-C.
4. **Annex-D** — exports (with GD details).
5. **Annex-B / Annex-I** — debit and credit notes.
6. **Annex-F** — stock statement (manufacturers — if FBR requires it for the period).
7. **Annex-H** — refund claim (zero-rated suppliers).
8. **Main return** — system computes output, input, §8B cap, further tax, extra tax, withholding adjustments, payable / carry-forward.
9. **Generate CPR** (Computerised Payment Receipt) for the net payable amount.
10. **Pay** via authorised bank (1-Link / over-the-counter / online banking) by the payment deadline.
11. **Submit return** via IRIS by the **18th of the following month**.

### 6.2 Payment instruments

- Online banking (1-Link member banks: HBL, UBL, MCB, Allied, Alfalah, Meezan, etc.) — generate CPR on IRIS, pay via Internet banking using the PSID (Payment Slip ID).
- ATM (1-Link enabled).
- Mobile banking apps (JazzCash, Easypaisa now also offer FBR payment for retail amounts).
- Over-the-counter at any authorised branch.

### 6.3 Late filing / late payment

- **Late filing penalty**: PKR 10,000 or PKR 200/day, whichever is higher.
- **Default surcharge** on unpaid tax: **KIBOR + 3%** per annum (§34 STA 1990).
- **Removal from ATL**: failure to file the STR by the due date moves the taxpayer off the next weekly ATL — buyers will lose input credit on purchases from this taxpayer until they re-register.
- **Re-instatement on ATL**: file all overdue returns + pay surcharge + ATL re-activation fee.

### 6.4 Revised returns

A revised return can be filed within **120 days** of the original filing date with **Commissioner Inland Revenue's approval** (§26(3) STA 1990). After 120 days, only the Commissioner can authorise revisions on application.

### 6.5 Coordination with provincial filings

If the taxpayer also supplies services (a separate business activity from goods), monthly provincial returns are filed in parallel:

- **Sindh**: SRB e-portal — by 15th–18th (varies).
- **Punjab**: PRA e-portal.
- **KP**: KPRA e-portal.
- **Balochistan**: BRA e-portal.
- **ICT (Islamabad)**: Federal — services tax in ICT is administered by FBR via a separate return (the ICT (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001 read with Finance Act). Sometimes filed alongside the federal goods STR.

See companion skill `pk-sales-tax-services` for provincial workflows.

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Counterparty registration unknown | Treat buyer as **unregistered** (apply further tax 4%); treat supplier as **unregistered** (no input credit) | Aligns with FBR's penal stance on input claims from unverified suppliers |
| Goods vs services unclear | Federal goods if tangible and movable; flag to `pk-sales-tax-services` if intangible / labour-based | Federal scope is strictly goods (§2(12)) |
| Rate unclear (could be Eighth Schedule reduced) | Apply **18%** standard | Eighth Schedule reductions require SRO confirmation; conservative is higher rate |
| Zero-rate (export) unconfirmed | Apply **18%** domestic | Export requires GD + BL + foreign inward remittance evidence |
| Exempt (Sixth Schedule) unconfirmed | Apply **18%** taxable | Sixth Schedule item lists are detailed and change; default to taxable |
| Tier-1 retailer status unclear | Treat as **Tier-1** if any §2(43A) marker present | Penalty for missed Tier-1 obligations (60% input disallowance) is severe |
| Eighth Schedule reduced-rate item not explicitly listed | Apply **18%** | Reduced rates are exhaustive per item |
| Further tax applicability unclear (buyer registration unknown) | Apply **further tax 4%** | Conservative; better to over-collect and refund than under-collect and face audit |
| Input invoice not visible on Annex-A | **No input credit** this period; claim only when invoice appears in Annex-A | §7 STA 1990 + IRIS protocol |
| Supplier ATL status unverified | **No input credit** | §8(1)(ca) blocks input from non-ATL suppliers |
| §8B 90% cap — sector exemption unclear | Apply the cap (deduct only 90%) | Sector-specific SRO exemptions are narrow; default to general rule |
| Refund eligibility unclear | Do not claim refund; carry input forward | Refund claims trigger audit; only claim with full documentation |
| Withholding sales tax — agent status unclear | Treat as non-withholding agent | Wrong withholding triggers default surcharge |
| Reverse-charge for imported services | Out of scope — refer to provincial / income tax | Federal STA 1990 does not have a reverse charge mechanism for services |

**Default count limit.** If more than **5 conservative defaults** are applied in a single STR working paper, flag the whole filing as MEDIUM risk and obtain explicit client confirmation before submission.

## Section 9 — Note on provincial sales tax on services (separate skill)

Sales tax on **services** in Pakistan is **NOT** within federal jurisdiction. Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment (2010), the power to tax services devolved to the provinces. Each province has its own legislation, authority, portal, rates, and return:

| Jurisdiction | Authority | Statute | Standard rate | Portal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sindh | SRB (Sindh Revenue Board) | Sindh Sales Tax on Services Act 2011 | 13% (some categories 8%, 10%, 15%) | https://e.srb.gos.pk |
| Punjab | PRA (Punjab Revenue Authority) | Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act 2012 | 16% (with reduced rates for some categories) | https://e.pra.punjab.gov.pk |
| KP | KPRA (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Revenue Authority) | KP Finance Act 2013, Second Schedule | 15% (varies) | https://kpra.kp.gov.pk |
| Balochistan | BRA (Balochistan Revenue Authority) | Balochistan Sales Tax on Services Act 2015 | 15% | https://bra.gob.pk |
| Islamabad Capital Territory | FBR (federal as agent for ICT) | ICT (Tax on Services) Ordinance 2001 | 16% (varies — aligned with PRA in practice) | IRIS (FBR portal) |

If a single business supplies **both goods and services**, it must file:
- The **federal STR** (this skill, `pk-sales-tax-federal`) for the goods leg, **and**
- The **applicable provincial return(s)** for the services leg (handled by `pk-sales-tax-services`).

Input tax cross-credit between federal goods ST and provincial services ST is **available** under various bilateral arrangements (FBR-SRB, FBR-PRA, etc.) but the mechanics differ by jurisdiction and require careful tracking. The companion skill covers this.

## Prohibitions

- NEVER claim input credit from a supplier whose STRN is **not on the ATL** at the date of supply (§8(1)(ca) STA 1990).
- NEVER apply the **17% rate** — current standard rate is **18%** since 1 July 2024.
- NEVER skip the **further tax 4%** when supplying to unregistered buyers (§3(1A) STA 1990).
- NEVER claim input credit without the invoice appearing in the buyer's **Annex-A** (auto-populated from supplier's Annex-C on IRIS).
- NEVER apply a **reduced rate** without confirming the current Eighth Schedule entry and any active SRO at the date of supply.
- NEVER treat a Tier-1 retailer's supplies as eligible for the integrated-retailer reduced rate **unless** POS integration is verified with FBR.
- NEVER assume **export zero-rating** without GD, BL, e-form, and foreign inward remittance evidence.
- NEVER ignore the **§8B 90% input cap** unless the taxpayer is in a sector specifically exempted by an active SRO.
- NEVER mix **federal goods ST** computations with **provincial services ST** — they are distinct returns to distinct authorities.
- NEVER present this skill's output as definitive — all returns must be reviewed and signed off by a Pakistan-registered Chartered Accountant or licensed tax practitioner before filing.
