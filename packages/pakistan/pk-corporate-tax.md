## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 2.1 Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — Full-year audited (or draft) financial statements (income statement, balance sheet), prior-year income tax return, computation of turnover and accounting income, confirmation of (i) company size status, (ii) sector (banking / non-banking), (iii) PSEB registration status if claiming IT exports concession, (iv) any group-relief / group-taxation election.

**Recommended** — General ledger, fixed-asset register and depreciation schedule per Third Schedule, related-party transactions schedule, withholding tax credit certificates (CPRs), prior-year tax-loss carry-forward schedule, prior-year minimum tax carry-forward (Section 113(2)(c)) and ACT carry-forward (Section 113C) schedules, advance tax payment receipts.

**Ideal** — Audited statements signed by an ICAP-registered audit firm, complete tax computation with reconciliation between accounting profit and taxable income, transfer-pricing disclosures (Schedule of related-party transactions and Section 108 statement), NTN and STRN certificates, board resolutions for material elections.

**HARD STOP if minimum is missing.** Without financial statements and the prior-year return, no corporate computation may be produced.

### 2.2 Refusal Catalogue

**R-PK-CT-1 — Non-resident companies / branches / PE.** Branches and PEs of non-resident companies are subject to attribution rules under Sections 105–107 and treaty interactions. Out of scope — escalate to a Pakistani tax adviser.

**R-PK-CT-2 — Sector-specific regimes.** Banking and insurance carry separate computational rules (Seventh Schedule for banking, Fourth Schedule for insurance). Oil & gas exploration and production (Fifth Schedule), mineral extraction, modarabas, mutual funds, REITs — all out of scope.

**R-PK-CT-3 — Group consolidated returns / group taxation under Section 59B.** Election under Section 59B (designated income group) requires SECP and FBR pre-approval; out of scope for this skill. Section 59AA (group relief — surrender of losses within a 100%-owned group) is discussed at Tier 2 but requires reviewer sign-off.

**R-PK-CT-4 — AOPs, individuals, NPOs, trusts.** Different rate schedules and computation rules. Out of scope — the company-specific First Schedule Part I Division II rules do not apply.

**R-PK-CT-5 — Special Economic Zones (SEZ) / Export Processing Zones (EPZ).** Sector and zone-specific exemptions under the SEZ Act 2012 and EPZ Ordinance. Out of scope.

**R-PK-CT-6 — Active assessment / audit / appellate proceedings.** If the company is in a Section 122 amendment, Section 177 audit, ATIR appeal, or High Court reference — escalate. Do not produce numbers that pre-empt the dispute.

**R-PK-CT-7 — Transfer pricing controversy.** Active MAP or APA proceedings, or Section 108 / Rule 20–27D disputes. Out of scope.

**R-PK-CT-8 — Cross-skill scope.** Sales tax and FED → `pakistan-sales-tax`. Withholding on payments (Section 149–158) is touched only insofar as it affects CIT credits — for compliance refer to a withholding-specific skill (TBD).

**R-PK-CT-9 — FA 2025 ambiguity.** Where the Finance Act 2025 text is uncertain on a specific point (rates, thresholds, schedule amendments), flag as **TBC** and decline to commit to a number without reviewer verification of the gazetted Act.

---

## Section 3 — Tier 1 — Rates by Company Size and Sector

### 3.1 Standard CIT Rate — 29%

**Legislation:** First Schedule, Part I, Division II, ITO 2001 as amended by Finance Act 2024 and Finance Act 2025.

The standard corporate income tax rate for **companies other than banking companies and small companies** is **29% of taxable income**.

```
CIT = 29% × Taxable Income
```

This is the default rate that applies unless the company qualifies for the small-company rate, falls within the banking rate, or is subject to a sector-specific schedule (insurance, oil & gas, etc.) — those are out of scope.

### 3.2 Banking Companies — 39%

**Legislation:** First Schedule, Part I, Division II, ITO 2001; Seventh Schedule (computation rules for banking).

Banking companies are taxed at **39%** on taxable income computed under the Seventh Schedule (Finance Act 2024). FA 2025 confirmation — **TBC**; reviewer should verify the gazetted FA 2025 text before applying.

The Seventh Schedule overrides much of the general computational framework — different rules for provisioning, bad debts, and certain receipts. The banking sector is largely out of scope for this skill (R-PK-CT-2); the 39% rate is referenced here only for completeness.

### 3.3 Small Companies — 20%

**Legislation:** Section 2(59A) ITO 2001 (definition); First Schedule, Part I, Division II (rate).

A **"small company"** means a company that satisfies **all** of the following conditions:

| Condition | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Paid-up capital plus undistributed reserves | ≤ Rs 50,000,000 |
| Annual turnover | ≤ Rs 250,000,000 |
| Number of employees | ≤ 250 (any time during the year) |
| Not formed by splitting up or reconstitution of an existing business | Section 2(59A)(d) |
| Not a subsidiary, holding, or associate of a company that is not itself a small company | Section 2(59A)(e) |
| Not engaged in certain excluded businesses | Per Section 2(59A) provisos (e.g., professional services with specific carve-outs) |

If **all** conditions are met, the rate is **20%**. If **any** condition fails — even by one rupee of turnover — the standard 29% applies for the entire tax year.

```
Small company CIT = 20% × Taxable Income
```

**Important:** The small-company test is applied each tax year on a fresh basis. A company exiting the band loses the rate for that entire year. The test is **all-or-nothing** — there is no sliding scale.

### 3.4 PSEB-Registered IT / ITeS Exports — 1% Final Tax (TBC under FA 2025)

**Legislation:** Historically Clause (133) of Part I of the Second Schedule and SROs concerning IT/ITeS export receipts; concessional 1% final tax on remittance of export proceeds through normal banking channels, conditional on PSEB (Pakistan Software Export Board) registration and IT/ITeS classification.

The IT/ITeS exports regime has changed multiple times. As of the most recent settled position (FA 2024), PSEB-registered IT and IT-enabled service exporters receive a **concessional 1% final tax** on export proceeds, contingent on:

- Active PSEB registration covering the tax year;
- Export proceeds remitted to Pakistan through normal banking channels and supported by Bank Credit Advices;
- Activities falling within the FBR/PSEB-defined IT/ITeS scope.

**FA 2025 status:** **TBC** — verify whether FA 2025 has amended the rate, scope, or the final-vs-minimum tax characterisation. Flag for reviewer.

**Conservative default:** Apply 29% on the gross profit attributable to IT exports until PSEB registration and applicable SRO/Clause text for the relevant tax year are verified. The 1% concession should be applied only after reviewer confirms (a) current-year PSEB certificate, (b) banking-channel inward remittance, and (c) the relevant Clause/SRO is still in force for TY 2025-26.

### 3.5 Taxable Income

```
Taxable Income = Total Income (Section 10) − Deductions (Sections 20–31) − Tax losses b/f (Sections 56–59)
```

**Heads of income** for companies — primarily *Income from Business* (Section 18). Other heads (capital gains, income from property, other sources) apply where relevant.

**Tax losses** may be carried forward for **6 tax years** from the year the loss arose (Section 57); **unabsorbed depreciation** can be carried forward indefinitely. Carry-back is not available.

**Depreciation** is governed by the Third Schedule — straight-line and reducing-balance rates per asset class; initial allowance under Section 23 applies in the first year for qualifying plant and machinery.

---

## Section 4 — Tier 2 — Super Tax, Minimum Tax, ACT, Group Taxation

### 4.1 Super Tax — Section 4C ITO 2001

**Legislation:** Section 4C ITO 2001 as inserted/amended; rates set in Division IIB of Part I of the First Schedule; current schedule per FA 2024 (and FA 2025 — **TBC**).

Super tax under Section 4C is an additional tax on **"income"** as defined for Section 4C purposes (broadly, income chargeable to tax under heads excluding certain exempt items — refer to the precise statutory definition). It is computed in **progressive bands** above Rs 150M:

| Income Band | Super Tax Rate (post-FA 2024) |
|---|---|
| Up to Rs 150,000,000 | **0%** |
| Rs 150,000,001 — Rs 200,000,000 | 1% |
| Rs 200,000,001 — Rs 250,000,000 | 2% |
| Rs 250,000,001 — Rs 300,000,000 | 3% |
| Rs 300,000,001 — Rs 350,000,000 | 4% |
| Rs 350,000,001 — Rs 400,000,000 | 6% |
| Rs 400,000,001 — Rs 500,000,000 | 8% |
| Above Rs 500,000,000 | **10%** |

*(Reviewer: confirm the band schedule against the current Finance Act for TY 2025-26 — slight band recalibrations occur each year. Flag as **TBC** if FA 2025 has shifted any threshold.)*

Super tax is **in addition to** the normal corporate tax and any minimum tax or ACT. It is **not creditable** against normal CIT and does not generate a carry-forward.

```
Super Tax = Σ (band rate × income within that band)
```

**Conservative default:** Apply the highest applicable band based on best-available income estimate. Do not net super tax against tax credits or losses unless the statutory language expressly permits it (it generally does not).

### 4.2 Minimum Tax on Turnover — Section 113

**Legislation:** Section 113 ITO 2001; rate currently **1.25%** of turnover for companies (post-FA 2024); certain sectors carry reduced rates per Division IX of Part I of the First Schedule.

Where a company's normal tax liability for a tax year is **less than 1.25% of turnover** — including where the company is in a tax-loss position — the company must pay **minimum tax at 1.25% of turnover** (Section 113(1)).

```
Minimum Tax = 1.25% × Turnover (where normal CIT < this floor)
```

**"Turnover"** for Section 113 means gross receipts (Section 113(3) definition) — generally gross sales and gross receipts from services and other business activities, **excluding** sales tax, FED, and refunds/discounts. Verify the precise inclusions per the current Section 113(3) text.

**Carry-forward:** Excess of minimum tax over normal tax is **carried forward up to 5 tax years** and adjustable against normal tax liability in those years (Section 113(2)(c)).

**Sector variations:** Some sectors (e.g., distributors of certain goods, refineries, oil marketing companies) have reduced rates under Division IX — flag to reviewer if the company is in a Division IX listed sector.

**Conservative default:** Compute both normal tax and minimum tax; pay the higher. Track minimum tax excess as a 5-year carry-forward.

### 4.3 Alternative Corporate Tax (ACT) — Section 113C

**Legislation:** Section 113C ITO 2001; ACT rate **17% of accounting income** (post-FA 2024 — confirm FA 2025 as **TBC**).

A company's tax liability for a tax year is the **higher of**:

1. **Corporate Tax** — normal CIT at the applicable rate (29% / 20% / 39%); or
2. **Alternative Corporate Tax (ACT)** — **17% of accounting income** (accounting income as defined in Section 113C, broadly profit before tax as per the financial statements with prescribed adjustments).

```
Liability = max ( Corporate Tax, 17% × Accounting Income )
```

**Definition nuance:** "Accounting income" for Section 113C is defined with carve-outs (e.g., exempt income, income subject to final tax regimes, share of profit from AOPs already taxed). The precise adjustment list is in Section 113C — apply it carefully, do not equate "accounting income" with raw PBT.

**Carry-forward:** Excess of ACT over normal corporate tax is **carried forward up to 10 tax years** and adjustable against normal CIT in those years.

**Interaction:** ACT does not displace Section 113 minimum tax — both regimes can apply. The company pays the highest of (normal CIT, Section 113 minimum tax, Section 113C ACT). Super tax under Section 4C is then added on top.

**Conservative default:** Compute all three (normal CIT, Section 113 minimum, Section 113C ACT) for every corporate engagement and pay the highest, then add Section 4C super tax.

### 4.4 Group Relief — Section 59AA

**Legislation:** Section 59AA ITO 2001.

A company that is a **wholly-owned subsidiary** (100% holding) within a designated group may **surrender its tax losses** to a parent or another 100%-owned company in the group for set-off against the recipient's taxable income, subject to:

- Both companies are resident in Pakistan;
- The holding is direct and 100% for the relevant tax year;
- The group is designated and the election is made within the statutory window;
- Continuity-of-business and continuity-of-ownership tests are met (per Section 59AA conditions and the related Rules);
- The surrendering company has no minimum-tax carry-forward issues that conflict with the surrender.

**Conservative default:** Treat companies as standalone (no group relief) unless the election and 100% ownership are documented and reviewer confirms compliance with Section 59AA.

### 4.5 Group Taxation — Section 59B

**Legislation:** Section 59B ITO 2001 and Group Taxation Rules.

A "designated income group" of 100%-owned companies may file a **single consolidated return** with intra-group transactions disregarded, subject to:

- Pre-approval by FBR;
- SECP and tax-authority designation as a group;
- All members are 100% owned (directly or through wholly-owned chain);
- Audited accounts in compliance with prescribed standards.

**Out of scope (R-PK-CT-3):** Section 59B election is complex and requires specialist advice; this skill does not produce group-taxation computations.

## Section 5 — Worked Examples

### 5.1 Pvt Ltd at Standard Rate

**Facts:** Brightline (Pvt) Ltd. Resident Pakistani company. Tax year 2025-26 (1 Jul 2025 – 30 Jun 2026).
- Turnover: Rs 1,200,000,000.
- Accounting profit before tax (per audited FS): Rs 220,000,000.
- Add-backs (depreciation accounting vs Third Schedule difference + non-deductible donations + accounting provisions reversed): + Rs 30,000,000.
- Deductions (initial allowance under Section 23): − Rs 20,000,000.
- Taxable income: Rs 230,000,000.
- Withholding tax credits (Bank profit, contract receipts WHT): Rs 12,000,000.
- Advance tax paid under Section 147 across four quarters: Rs 55,000,000.

**5.1.1 Normal CIT.** Brightline is **not a small company** (turnover Rs 1.2B exceeds Rs 250M). Standard 29% applies.
```
Normal CIT = 29% × 230,000,000 = Rs 66,700,000
```

**5.1.2 Section 113 Minimum Tax.**
```
Minimum Tax = 1.25% × 1,200,000,000 = Rs 15,000,000
```
Normal CIT (Rs 66.7M) > minimum tax (Rs 15M). Pay normal CIT. No minimum-tax excess to carry forward.

**5.1.3 Section 113C ACT.**
```
ACT = 17% × Accounting Income (Rs 220,000,000) = Rs 37,400,000
```
Normal CIT (Rs 66.7M) > ACT (Rs 37.4M). Pay normal CIT. No ACT excess to carry forward.

**5.1.4 Section 4C Super Tax.** Income for Section 4C is Rs 230M (within the Rs 200M–Rs 250M band).
```
Super tax on Rs 150,000,000             = 0%  × 150,000,000  = Rs 0
Super tax on Rs 50,000,000 (150M–200M)  = 1%  ×  50,000,000  = Rs 500,000
Super tax on Rs 30,000,000 (200M–230M)  = 2%  ×  30,000,000  = Rs 600,000
                                                                ─────────────
Total Section 4C Super Tax                                    = Rs 1,100,000
```

**5.1.5 Total liability.**
```
Normal CIT          Rs 66,700,000
Super Tax (4C)      Rs  1,100,000
                    ──────────────
Total              Rs 67,800,000

Less: WHT credits        Rs 12,000,000
Less: Advance tax paid   Rs 55,000,000
                    ──────────────
Payable at filing  Rs   800,000
```

Payable with the IRIS return by **31 December 2026**.

### 5.2 Small Company

**Facts:** TechSouk (SMC-Pvt) Ltd. All Section 2(59A) conditions met (paid-up + reserves Rs 30M; turnover Rs 180M; 80 employees; not a split-off; not a subsidiary).
- Turnover Rs 180,000,000.
- Taxable income Rs 22,000,000.

**5.2.1 Normal CIT at small-company rate.**
```
Normal CIT = 20% × 22,000,000 = Rs 4,400,000
```

**5.2.2 Section 113 Minimum.**
```
Minimum Tax = 1.25% × 180,000,000 = Rs 2,250,000
```
Normal CIT (Rs 4.4M) > minimum tax. Pay normal CIT.

**5.2.3 Section 113C ACT.** If accounting income = Rs 25M:
```
ACT = 17% × 25,000,000 = Rs 4,250,000
```
Normal CIT (Rs 4.4M) > ACT (Rs 4.25M). Pay normal CIT.

**5.2.4 Super Tax.** Income Rs 22M is below Rs 150M threshold — **no Section 4C liability**.

**Total liability: Rs 4,400,000** before WHT credits / advance tax.

### 5.3 PSEB-Registered IT Exporter (Conservative Default)

**Facts:** CodeKarachi (Pvt) Ltd. Claims PSEB-registered IT services exporter for TY 2025-26.
- IT export receipts (banking-channel remittance with BCAs): Rs 500,000,000.
- Domestic services receipts: Rs 50,000,000.
- Total turnover: Rs 550,000,000.

**Approach — Conservative.** Until reviewer verifies (i) current PSEB certificate for TY 2025-26 and (ii) the precise FA 2025 text on the 1% concession (**TBC**), apply the standard 29% to the full taxable income.

**If reviewer confirms the 1% concession applies** (final-tax basis on export remittances under the relevant Clause/SRO for TY 2025-26):

```
Tax on export receipts (final tax)  = 1% × 500,000,000 = Rs 5,000,000
Domestic income — taxed at normal CIT (29%) on attributable taxable income
```

Reviewer must confirm (a) the export receipts qualify as "IT/ITeS exports" per the PSEB/FBR list, (b) banking-channel remittance evidenced, (c) the Clause/SRO is in force for TY 2025-26, and (d) whether the 1% is **final** (no further tax on those proceeds) or **minimum** (top-up if normal tax is higher). The historical position is final tax — **TBC under FA 2025**.

### 5.4 Banking Company (Reference Only — Out of Scope)

**Facts:** AlphaBank Ltd. Taxable income (Seventh Schedule basis) Rs 8,000,000,000.

```
Banking CIT = 39% × 8,000,000,000 = Rs 3,120,000,000
```

Plus applicable super tax under Section 4C (banking-sector specific bands may apply — **verify**). Beyond this rate reference, banking is **out of scope (R-PK-CT-2)**.

---

## Section 6 — Filing and Payment Mechanics

### 6.1 Annual Return — IRIS

**Form:** Income Tax Return for Companies — filed electronically via **IRIS** (iris.fbr.gov.pk).

**Required schedules** (typical, non-exhaustive):

| Schedule | Content |
|---|---|
| Main return | Computation of taxable income; tax payable |
| Wealth statement | N/A for companies (applies to individuals) |
| Schedule of business income | Section 18 computation |
| Schedule of depreciation | Third Schedule rates per asset class |
| Schedule of tax credits | WHT credits, foreign tax credit, advance tax |
| Schedule of related-party transactions (Section 108) | Disclosures for transfer-pricing purposes |
| Schedule of minimum tax / ACT | Section 113 / 113C computations and carry-forwards |
| Schedule of super tax (Section 4C) | Band computation |
| Audited financial statements | Attached |

### 6.2 Filing Deadlines

| Item | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Annual return (companies with normal tax year) | **31 December** following tax year-end (e.g., 31 Dec 2026 for TY 2025-26) |
| Special tax year return | 30 September following the special tax year-end, **unless** the Commissioner specifies otherwise — verify |
| Extension request | Application under Section 119 to the Commissioner; not automatic |
| Section 147 advance tax — Q1 | **25 September** |
| Section 147 advance tax — Q2 | **25 December** |
| Section 147 advance tax — Q3 | **25 March** |
| Section 147 advance tax — Q4 | **15 June** (note the earlier date in the fourth quarter) |
| Annual tax payable balance | Due with the annual return (i.e., by 31 December) |
| Section 108 statement (related-party) | Filed with the annual return |

### 6.3 Section 147 Advance Tax

**Legislation:** Section 147 ITO 2001.

Companies pay **quarterly advance tax** computed on the basis of the **latest assessed taxable income** (Section 147(4)) divided by four, less applicable credits:

```
Quarterly advance tax = (Latest assessed taxable income × applicable CIT rate) / 4 − WHT credits attributable to that quarter
```

If the company estimates that current-year liability will be **materially lower** than the prior assessed basis, it may file an **estimate under Section 147(6)** and pay on that lower figure — but Section 147 contains **default-surcharge mechanics** if the year-end liability exceeds the estimate. Conservative default: pay on the latest-assessed basis.

**Late or short advance payment** triggers default surcharge under Section 205 (current rate per the Act / FBR — typically KIBOR-plus or a flat 12%/year-equivalent — verify against current Section 205 text).

### 6.4 Withholding Tax Credits

WHT collected against the company under Sections 149–158 (e.g., contract payments, services, bank profit, rent) is **creditable against the annual CIT liability**, subject to the CPR (Computerised Payment Receipt) evidence and matching in IRIS.

**Some WHT regimes are "final tax"** (e.g., certain export receipts under Section 154, dividend tax under Section 150) — those receipts are **excluded** from the normal CIT computation entirely, and the WHT is **not creditable** against other income. Verify the head and the relevant clause / Division for each receipt before crediting.

### 6.5 Audit, Assessment, and Statute of Limitations

- **Self-assessment** under Section 120 — return as filed becomes the assessment unless selected for audit.
- **Audit selection** under Section 177 / 214C — Commissioner may select; risk-based or parametric.
- **Amendment of assessment** under Section 122 — up to **5 years** from end of the financial year in which the original assessment was made (extendable in cases of concealment).
- **Appeals** — Commissioner (Appeals) → Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) → High Court reference → Supreme Court appeal.

### 6.6 Common Penalty Headings (Section 182 and others)

| Infraction | Sanction |
|---|---|
| Failure to file return on time | 0.1% of tax payable per day, min Rs 40,000, max 50% of tax payable (Section 182, item 1) |
| Failure to maintain records | Rs 25,000 / 10% of tax — verify current schedule |
| Failure to file Section 108 statement | Per Section 182 schedule |
| Concealment of income | Up to 100% of tax sought to be evaded |
| Late payment of tax / advance tax | Default surcharge under Section 205 (verify current rate) |
| Wilful tax evasion | Prosecution under Sections 191–194 + financial penalties |

**Conservative default:** File and pay on time. Penalty figures above are illustrative — confirm against the current Section 182 table and any FA 2025 amendments before quoting to a client.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the small-company rate (20%) without confirming **all** Section 2(59A) conditions are met for the relevant tax year.
- NEVER apply the 1% PSEB IT-exports concession without (a) current PSEB registration for the tax year, (b) banking-channel remittance evidence, and (c) reviewer verification that the Clause/SRO is in force for TY 2025-26.
- NEVER skip the Section 113 minimum-tax computation — it applies even in tax-loss years.
- NEVER skip the Section 113C ACT computation — accounting income can exceed taxable income materially.
- NEVER omit Section 4C super tax where income exceeds Rs 150M.
- NEVER credit "final-tax" WHT against normal CIT — separate it out.
- NEVER use current-year forecast as Section 147 basis without filing a formal Section 147(6) estimate; default to the latest-assessed basis.
- NEVER advise late filing or late payment of tax / advance tax — Section 205 default surcharge and Section 182 penalties are severe.
- NEVER apply group relief (Section 59AA) without confirming 100% ownership, residency, and the statutory continuity tests.
- NEVER produce a group-consolidated computation under Section 59B (R-PK-CT-3).
- NEVER quote FA 2025 specifics without verifying the gazetted text — mark **TBC** where uncertain.
- NEVER ignore the four advance-tax due dates (25 Sep, 25 Dec, 25 Mar, **15 Jun**); note that Q4 falls earlier than the quarter-end pattern.
- NEVER treat WHT, super tax, minimum tax, and ACT as alternatives without computing each — the liability is normal CIT vs (max of minimum tax, ACT), **plus** Section 4C, **less** creditable WHT and advance tax.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — always label as estimates pending reviewer sign-off by an ICAP CA / ICMA Pakistan member.
