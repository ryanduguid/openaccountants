## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Who Must Comply

**B2G (Business-to-Government):**
All suppliers to Romanian public institutions must issue e-invoices via RO e-Factura. Mandatory since November 2021 for voluntary adoption, compulsory since July 2022.

**B2B (Business-to-Business):**
All taxable persons established in Romania (VAT-registered or not) must transmit invoices through RO e-Factura for domestic supplies of goods and services with place of supply in Romania. Non-resident entities registered for VAT in Romania must also comply. Since July 2024, this operates as a centralised exchange clearance model -- an invoice is not legally valid until ANAF validates it.

**B2C (Business-to-Consumer):**
Mandatory from 1 January 2025 for Romanian-established taxpayers. Simplified invoices under Art. 319(12) of the Fiscal Code are exempt. Grace period for penalties ran until 31 March 2025. Certain entities (small taxpayers, non-profits, farmers under special regimes) had until 1 July 2025 to comply.

### Thresholds and Exemptions

- No turnover threshold -- all taxable persons established in Romania must comply.
- Exempt: invoices for intra-community supplies, exports, services taxed outside Romania.
- Exempt: transactions within the OSS (One-Stop Shop) regime.
- Simplified invoices issued via electronic cash registers are exempt from RO e-Factura but require fiscal memory compliance.

### Timeline Phases

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| November 2021 | RO e-Factura launched for B2G and voluntary B2B |
| July 2022 | B2G and high-risk B2B (fruit, vegetables, alcohol, mineral water, construction, new buildings) mandatory |
| January 2024 | All B2B reporting mandatory (5 working day submission window) |
| July 2024 | B2B clearance model active -- invoice legally valid only after ANAF validation |
| January 2025 | B2C e-invoicing mandatory for established taxpayers |
| July 2025 | Remaining B2C exemptions expire (non-profits, small farmers) |

---

## Section 3 -- Technical Format

### Invoice Format

Romania follows the European standard EN 16931 and accepts two syntaxes:
- **UBL 2.1** (OASIS Universal Business Language) -- the primary and most common format
- **CII** (UN/CEFACT Cross-Industry Invoice) -- accepted but rarely used

### National CIUS

**CIUS-RO** (Core Invoice Usage Specification -- Romania) defines national business rules on top of EN 16931. Current version: **ro16931-ubl-1.0.9** (effective from 5 June 2024).

CIUS-RO specifies:
- Mandatory Romanian fiscal identifiers (CUI/CIF)
- Romanian-specific tax category codes
- National validation schematrons (operational rules + VAT rules + code list rules)
- Required document type codes for invoices and credit notes

### Schema and Namespaces

| Component | Value |
|---|---|
| UBL 2.1 Invoice schema | `UBL-Invoice-2.1.xsd` |
| UBL 2.1 CreditNote schema | `UBL-CreditNote-2.1.xsd` |
| EN 16931 schematron | CEN/TC 434 base rules |
| CIUS-RO schematron | `ro16931-ubl-1.0.9.sch` |
| Primary namespace | `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:Invoice-2` |
| Common components | `urn:oasis:names:specification:ubl:schema:xsd:CommonBasicComponents-2` |

## Section 4 -- Mandatory Fields

### Fields Required by CIUS-RO (Beyond EN 16931 Baseline)

| Field | UBL Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Supplier tax ID (CUI/CIF) | `cac:AccountingSupplierParty/cac:Party/cac:PartyTaxScheme/cbc:CompanyID` | Must be valid Romanian CUI or CIF |

| Invoice number | `cbc:ID` | Unique, sequential |
| Issue date | `cbc:IssueDate` | ISO 8601 format |
| Due date | `cbc:DueDate` | Required if applicable |
| Invoice type code | `cbc:InvoiceTypeCode` | 380 (invoice), 381 (credit note), 389 (self-billed) |
| Currency code | `cbc:DocumentCurrencyCode` | RON or EUR; if non-RON, must include exchange rate |
| Tax point date | `cbc:TaxPointDate` | Date of supply |
| Supplier name and address | `cac:AccountingSupplierParty/cac:Party/cac:PostalAddress` | Full legal address |

### B2C-Specific Fields

For B2C e-reporting (from 2025), the buyer identification uses a unique identifier. On the test/production platform, a dedicated B2C upload endpoint is used (mandatory since 31 March 2025).

---

## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### RO e-Factura Platform (SPV)

| Channel | Detail |
|---|---|
| SPV web portal | Manual upload of XML invoices at anaf.ro → Factura electronică → Trimitere Factură |
| REST API | Automated submission via ANAF web services; separate endpoints for B2B/B2G and B2C |
| Authentication | Qualified digital certificate (semnătură electronică calificată) registered in SPV |
| Submission deadline | 5 calendar days from invoice issuance (but no later than 5 calendar days from the legal deadline for issuance under Art. 319(16) Fiscal Code) |
| Recipient download | Buyer must download validated invoice within 60 days |
| Download availability | Validated XML available for download for 60 days; after that, archived and available on request |

### API Workflow

1. **Authenticate** with qualified digital certificate via SPV
2. **Upload** XML invoice to the appropriate endpoint (B2B/B2G or B2C)
3. **Receive** upload confirmation with upload index ID
4. **ANAF validates** the invoice (schema + CIUS-RO + business rules)
5. **Download** validation result: status = "ok" (validated) or "nok" (rejected with error codes)
6. **For B2B clearance (post-July 2024):** validated invoice = legally issued invoice; buyer retrieves from RO e-Factura

### API Rate Limits

ANAF enforces API call limits. Consult the current "Limite Apeluri API" documentation on the MF technical page for throttling thresholds.

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### ANAF Validation Process

Upon upload, ANAF performs:
1. **XML schema validation** against UBL 2.1 or CII XSD
2. **EN 16931 base rule validation** (CEN/TC 434 schematrons)
3. **CIUS-RO rule validation** (national schematrons for operational rules, VAT rules, code lists)
4. **Business rule validation** (NIF/CUI validity, duplicate check, date consistency)
5. **Return status**: validated (with download ID for buyer) or rejected (with error details)

### Pre-Submission Checks

- Validate XML locally against UBL 2.1 XSD and CIUS-RO schematron before uploading
- Verify CUI/CIF validity using ANAF's public API
- Ensure invoice number uniqueness within your series
- Confirm tax point date and issue date are consistent
- Verify VAT rates match current Romanian rates

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Detail |
|---|---|
| Schema violation | XML does not conform to UBL 2.1 XSD |
| CIUS-RO rule failure | National business rule violation (e.g., missing Romanian tax ID format) |
| Invalid CUI/CIF | Tax identification number fails ANAF validation |
| Duplicate invoice | Invoice number already submitted for the same supplier |
| Invalid tax category | Tax code does not match VAT treatment |
| Missing mandatory field | Required element absent or empty |
| Date inconsistency | Issue date after upload date, or tax point date mismatch |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates (2026)

| Rate | Percentage | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 19% | Most goods and services |
| Reduced 1 | 9% | Foodstuffs, water supply, medicines, hotel accommodation, restaurant services |
| Reduced 2 | 5% | Social housing (under thresholds), cultural events, certain children's products |
| Exempt with credit | 0% | Intra-community supplies, exports |
| Exempt without credit | 0% | Financial services, insurance, education, healthcare |

### Rounding Rules

- VAT amounts calculated per line, rounded to 2 decimal places (RON bani or EUR cents).
- Line totals summed; total VAT is the sum of rounded line-level VAT amounts.
- For multi-currency invoices: amounts must appear in the document currency; if not RON, the BNR (National Bank of Romania) exchange rate on the tax point date applies.

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

Each VAT rate requires a separate `cac:TaxSubtotal` element within `cac:TaxTotal`. Tax base and tax amount must be stated per rate category.

### Credit Notes

Credit notes must reference the original invoice number in `cac:BillingReference/cac:InvoiceDocumentReference/cbc:ID`. The invoice type code is 381. Negative amounts are expressed as positive values on the credit note (the document type signals the reversal).

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 10 years from the end of the fiscal year in which the invoice was issued |
| Format | Original XML as validated by ANAF (the validated XML is the legally binding document for B2B clearance) |
| Accessibility | Must be available for tax inspection on demand throughout retention period |
| ANAF download window | Validated invoices available on RO e-Factura for 60 days; after expiry, must be retrieved via archive request |
| Buyer obligation | Buyer must download and archive the validated XML within 60 days |
| Integrity | Digital certificate chain must remain verifiable; no modifications to the validated XML |
| Location | May be stored within the EU; storage outside Romania requires notification to ANAF |
| Conversion to PDF | ANAF provides XML-to-PDF conversion tools; the PDF is for human readability only and is not the legal document |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

### Late or Missing Submission Penalties

| Taxpayer Category | Fine per Incident (RON) |
|---|---|
| Large taxpayers (contribuabili mari) | 5,000 -- 10,000 |
| Medium taxpayers (contribuabili mijlocii) | 2,500 -- 5,000 |
| Small taxpayers and individuals | 1,000 -- 2,500 |

Fines apply per month in which one or more invoices miss the submission deadline. Multiple invoices in the same month = one fine.

### Additional Penalties

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Receiving/registering a B2B invoice not transmitted via RO e-Factura (buyer penalty) | 15% of the total invoice value |
| Failure to issue invoice via RO e-Factura for in-scope B2B transactions | Fine equal to the VAT amount on the invoice |
| B2C non-compliance (post-grace period) | Same graduated fines as above by taxpayer category |

### Consequences Beyond Fines

- Loss of VAT deduction rights for invoices not properly issued/received through RO e-Factura
- Increased audit risk from ANAF's risk-analysis system
- Buyer notification right: if a buyer does not receive the invoice via RO e-Factura within the legal deadline, they can notify ANAF, triggering enforcement action against the supplier

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### RO e-Factura → VAT Return (Declarația 300)

ANAF uses RO e-Factura data to pre-populate the draft VAT return (RO e-TVA initiative). From 2024, ANAF cross-references e-Factura submissions against VAT declarations. Discrepancies trigger automated notifications and potential audits.

### RO e-Factura → RO e-TVA

The RO e-TVA system provides taxpayers with a pre-filled VAT return based on RO e-Factura data, RO e-Transport data, and customs declarations. Taxpayers must review and adjust before submission.

### RO e-Factura → SAF-T (D406)

Romania also requires SAF-T reporting (Declarația 406) for large and medium taxpayers. Invoice data from RO e-Factura should be consistent with SAF-T submissions. ANAF cross-checks between the two systems.

### RO e-Transport Integration

For goods movements, RO e-Transport operates alongside RO e-Factura. Transport documents and invoices must carry consistent references. Goods in transit without matching e-Transport declarations face confiscation risk.

### Corporate Tax (Impozit pe profit)

Invoice data feeds into corporate tax assessments. ANAF uses e-Factura data to verify revenue declarations and deduction claims.
