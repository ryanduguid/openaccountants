## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- **Required inputs before computing** — Before computing, you MUST obtain: 1. Entity type -- PFA, II, or liberal profession? 2. Estimated annual net income -- determines which tier applies 3. Income type -- independent activities, intellectual property, rental, agricultural? 4. Is the client also employed? -- CAS may not be required if already paying through employment 5. Year of activity -- first year or ongoing?  _(Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue)_
- **Stop condition** — If net income estimate is unknown, STOP. The tier-based system requires knowing anticipated income.  _(Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue)_

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-RO-SOC-1 -- Multiple income source aggregation** — Trigger: client has PFA + IP + rental income and asks how they interact. Message: "Aggregation rules for multiple income categories require confirmation with consultant fiscal. Flag for reviewer."  _(Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue)_

### Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions list** — NEVER compute CAS/CASS on actual income -- the contribution base is a FIXED tier multiple of minimum wage; NEVER forget that below the 6x threshold, the client has NO health insurance coverage; NEVER confuse annual thresholds with monthly amounts; NEVER ignore that CAS and CASS are both deductible from income tax; NEVER tell a client below the CAS threshold that they have pension coverage (unless voluntary opt-in); NEVER present a single rate (e.g., "25% of income") -- CAS is 25% of the FIXED BASE; NEVER assume employment CAS exempts from self-employment CAS if self-employment income crosses the threshold  _(Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue)_

## Section 3 -- CAS (pension) tier system

- **CAS legislation citation** — Codul Fiscal, art. 148-150  _(Codul Fiscal, art. 148-150)_

**CAS (pension) tier system**  _(Codul Fiscal, art. 148-150)_

| Estimated annual net income | CAS due? | Contribution base | Annual CAS (25%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Below RON 48,600 (< 12x min wage) | Voluntary only | N/A | RON 0 (unless opt-in at RON 12,150) |
| RON 48,600 -- RON 97,200 | Mandatory | RON 48,600 | RON 12,150 |
| Above RON 97,200 (> 24x min wage) | Mandatory | RON 97,200 | RON 24,300 |

- **CAS base determination** — CAS is based on ESTIMATED net income declared in the Declarația Unică. The base is fixed at tier level, NOT at actual income.  _(Codul Fiscal, art. 148-150)_

## Section 4 -- CASS (health insurance) tier system

- **CASS legislation citation** — Codul Fiscal, art. 170-174  _(Codul Fiscal, art. 170-174)_

**CASS (health insurance) tier system**  _(Codul Fiscal, art. 170-174)_

| Estimated annual net income | CASS due? | Contribution base | Annual CASS (10%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Below RON 24,300 (< 6x min wage) | No (but no health coverage) | N/A | RON 0 |
| RON 24,300 -- RON 48,600 | Yes | RON 24,300 | RON 2,430 |
| RON 48,600 -- RON 97,200 | Yes | RON 48,600 | RON 4,860 |
| Above RON 97,200 | Yes | RON 97,200 | RON 9,720 |

## Section 5 -- Computation steps

### Step 5.1 -- Estimate annual net income

- **Net income formula** — net_income = gross_revenue - deductible_expenses  _(Section 5 -- Computation steps)_

### Step 5.2 -- Determine CAS tier

- **CAS tier determination** — IF net_income < 48,600: CAS = 0  (voluntary opt-in at RON 12,150) ELIF net_income <= 97,200: CAS = 48,600 x 25% = 12,150 ELSE: CAS = 97,200 x 25% = 24,300  _(Section 5 -- Computation steps)_

### Step 5.3 -- Determine CASS tier

- **CASS tier determination** — IF net_income < 24,300: CASS = 0  (no health coverage) ELIF net_income < 48,600: CASS = 24,300 x 10% = 2,430 ELIF net_income <= 97,200: CASS = 48,600 x 10% = 4,860 ELSE: CASS = 97,200 x 10% = 9,720  _(Section 5 -- Computation steps)_

### Step 5.4 -- Total

- **Total contribution formula** — total = CAS + CASS  _(Section 5 -- Computation steps)_

## Section 6 -- Filing, payment, and tax deductibility

### Declarația Unică

**Declarația Unică obligations**

| Obligation | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Form | Declarația Unică (Formular 212) |
| Initial filing | By 25 May of current year (estimate + prior-year reconciliation) |
| Reconciliation | Actual income in next year's filing |

### Payment schedule

**Payment schedule**

| Payment | Due date |
| --- | --- |
| Full annual CAS + CASS | By 25 May of following year |
| Optional advances | Any time (recommended) |

- **Late payment penalties** — Late payment: interest (0.01%/day) and penalties (0.01%/day).  _(Section 6 -- Filing, payment, and tax deductibility)_

### Tax deductibility

**Tax deductibility**

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Is CAS deductible? | YES -- from net income for income tax |
| Is CASS deductible? | YES |
| When deductible? | Year contributions relate to (accrual) |
| Effect | Reduces 10% income tax base |

## Section 7 -- Interaction with employment and special situations

### Employed AND self-employed

**Employed and self-employed scenarios**

| Scenario | CAS obligation | CASS obligation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SE income < 12x min wage | No additional CAS | CASS at applicable tier on SE income |
| SE income >= 12x min wage | CAS at applicable tier | CASS at applicable tier |

- **Employment CAS does not exempt SE CAS** — Employment CAS does NOT exempt from self-employment CAS if SE income crosses threshold.  _(Section 7 -- Interaction with employment and special situations)_

### Norma de venit (income norm)

- **Norma de venit threshold rule** — CAS/CASS thresholds apply to the norma de venit amount, not actual income.  _(Section 7 -- Interaction with employment and special situations)_

### First year of activity

- **First year of activity rule** — Estimated income for remaining months only. Thresholds are NOT pro-rated -- they remain annual.  _(Section 7 -- Interaction with employment and special situations)_
