# Virginia Corporate Income Tax and BPOL Local Tax

Virginia imposes a 6% flat corporate income tax under Va. Code §58.1-400, unchanged since 1972. Effective tax year 2025, Virginia uses a single sales factor for multistate apportionment (phased in 2014-2024 from a three-factor double-weighted formula; manufacturers have used single sales since 2014). A Pass-Through Entity (PTE) election at 5.75% under Va. Code §58.1-390.3 has been available since tax year 2021. Localities (counties, cities, towns) impose BPOL gross-receipts taxes ranging from $0.05 to $0.58 per $100 by classification, with annual licenses generally due by March 1. Tax year 2025.

## 1. Scope

This skill covers Virginia state-level corporate income tax under Va. Code §58.1, Chapter 3 (Articles 1-13), the elective Pass-Through Entity tax under Va. Code §58.1-390.3, and the local Business, Professional, Occupational License (BPOL) tax under Va. Code §58.1-3700 et seq. It is intended for use by Virginia-based or Virginia-doing-business C-corporations, S-corporations, partnerships, and single-member LLCs with Virginia nexus, as well as out-of-state contractors performing work in Virginia jurisdictions.

### 1.1 In scope

- Single sales factor apportionment (Schedule 500A)
- Elective consolidated returns (Form 500CR election; binding)
- PTE election under Va. Code §58.1-390.3 (Form 502PTET, refundable credit Form PTE)
- S-corporation and partnership informational filing (Form 502)
- Quarterly estimated tax (Form 500ES)
- Six-month automatic extension to file (no extension to pay)
- BPOL gross-receipts tax in all 95 counties and 38 independent cities
- Out-of-state contractor BPOL exposure (90-day rule)
- NOL conformity (20-year carryforward, no carryback, 80% post-TCJA limit)

### 1.2 Out of scope (refer out)

- Virginia individual income tax (PIT) — see `va-individual-income-tax`
- Virginia sales and use tax (5.3% statewide + 1% NoVA/Hampton Roads + 1% Hampton Roads regional + 0.7% Central Virginia) — see `va-sales-use-tax`
- Real estate tax (locally assessed)
- Machinery and Tools (M&T) tax under Va. Code §58.1-3507 (locally assessed; separate from BPOL)
- Personal property tax on business equipment
- Bank franchise tax (Va. Code §58.1-1200 et seq.)
- Insurance premiums license tax
- Utility license tax (gross receipts of public service corporations)
- Litter tax (Va. Code §58.1-1707; nominal but separate annual filing)
- Recordation tax
- Federal Schedule C, Schedule SE, federal corporate (Form 1120, 1120S) — see federal skills

### 1.3 Caller assumptions

This skill assumes:

- The reviewer holds a Virginia CPA license or equivalent professional credential
- Federal taxable income is already computed (we start from federal Line 28 / Line 21 / Line 22)
- The entity has determined its federal classification before invoking this skill
- BPOL gross receipts are gross of cost of goods sold and gross of refunds in most localities (some classifications allow deductions — see §11)
- All references are to tax year 2025 unless otherwise noted

## 2. Corporate Income Tax — Rate and Base

### 2.1 Rate

Virginia imposes a **flat 6%** corporate income tax under Va. Code §58.1-400. The rate has been unchanged since the 1972 reorganization of Title 58 (subsequently recodified as Title 58.1 in 1984). There are no brackets, no surtaxes, no AMT, and no minimum tax.

There is no franchise tax based on capital, net worth, or shares outstanding. Virginia is one of the few states without any net-worth-style component on top of the income tax.

### 2.2 Tax base — Virginia Taxable Income (VTI)

The starting point is federal taxable income before the federal NOL deduction and before the federal dividends-received deduction (Form 1120, Line 28). This is then adjusted on Schedule 500ADJ:

**Additions (Va. Code §58.1-402(B)):**

- Interest on state and local obligations of states other than Virginia
- Income taxes imposed by any state and deducted federally (Va. Code §58.1-402(B)(4))
- The federal §199A QBI deduction is **not** added back for C-corps (C-corps don't claim §199A)
- Bonus depreciation in excess of Virginia conformity (Virginia conforms to federal bonus depreciation as of the fixed-date conformity statute — see §2.5)
- §168(k) bonus depreciation excess for years where Virginia decoupled (historic)
- Excess business interest expense disallowed under §163(j) that Virginia decouples from (Virginia conforms to §163(j) for tax year 2025 — no add-back required)

**Subtractions (Va. Code §58.1-402(C)):**

- Interest on U.S. obligations
- Federal income tax refunds previously included
- Foreign-source income to the extent included federally and not subject to Virginia tax under apportionment
- Subpart F income (limited)
- GILTI — Virginia provides a 95% subtraction for GILTI effective tax year 2023+ (Va. Code §58.1-402(C)(40))
- Dividends from subsidiaries owned 50%+ that are eligible for the federal DRD (Virginia provides its own DRD mirroring federal §243 partially)

### 2.3 Apportionment to Virginia

After computing VTI on a 100% basis, apportionment to Virginia is via the **single sales factor** for tax year 2025 (see §3).

### 2.4 NOL

Virginia conforms to the federal NOL rules as modified by TCJA and CARES Act, with the following Virginia-specific features:

- **20-year carryforward** at the Virginia level (mirrors pre-TCJA federal rules — Virginia did not adopt the federal indefinite carryforward, but in practice for losses arising in tax years 2018+ Virginia follows the federal indefinite rule because the Virginia NOL is computed by reference to the federal NOL)
- **No carryback** for losses arising in tax year 2018 or later (conforms to TCJA elimination of carryback)
- **80% limitation** — Virginia conforms to the IRC §172(a)(2) 80% of taxable income limitation for NOLs arising in tax years 2018+
- Virginia NOL is computed by apportioning the federal NOL in the year it arose, using that year's Virginia apportionment factor (i.e., Virginia NOLs are "trapped" at the Virginia level using the originating year's factor)

Important: Virginia does NOT allow a separate Virginia NOL election. The entity's federal NOL position governs Virginia subject to the apportionment limitation.

### 2.5 Federal conformity — fixed date

Virginia is a **fixed-date conformity** state. Va. Code §58.1-301 sets the conformity date. For tax year 2025 returns, the conformity date is December 31, 2024 (advanced by the 2025 General Assembly conformity bill, typically passed in February of the filing year as an emergency act).

This means:
- All federal IRC provisions in effect as of December 31, 2024 are incorporated
- Any federal changes enacted in calendar 2025 (e.g., late-2025 provisions of OBBBA effective for 2025) require Virginia conformity legislation before they apply
- The 2025 Virginia General Assembly enacted HB 1099 (hypothetical citation pending — **verify with reviewer**) advancing conformity to December 31, 2024 with selective decoupling

Selective decoupling items for tax year 2025 typically include:
- Continued add-back of §199 (domestic production activities deduction — historical; no longer relevant for tax years 2018+)
- §163(j) — Virginia generally conforms to current federal version
- Bonus depreciation — Virginia conforms (no decoupling for 2025 unless General Assembly acts)

---

## 3. Apportionment and the 2025 Single Sales Factor

### 3.1 Historical phase-in

Virginia historically used a three-factor formula (property, payroll, sales) with double-weighted sales. Beginning in 2014 the General Assembly phased in single sales factor for select industries and then generally:

- **2013 — Manufacturers** (Va. Code §58.1-422): single sales factor, market-based sourcing of services
- **2014 — Retailers** (Va. Code §58.1-422.1): single sales factor
- **2018 — Motor carriers**: single mileage factor (already in place historically under §58.1-417)
- **2019-2023 — Phase-in for general corporations**: triple-weighted sales factor moving toward single sales
- **2024 — Quadruple-weighted sales factor** (transition year)
- **2025 — Single sales factor for all corporations** (Va. Code §58.1-408 as amended)

### 3.2 Single sales factor — current formula

For tax year 2025 the Virginia apportionment formula is:

```
Apportionment % = Virginia sales / Everywhere sales
```

Where "sales" includes:

- Gross receipts from sales of tangible personal property delivered to a Virginia purchaser (ultimate destination)
- Gross receipts from services (sourced under market-based sourcing — see §3.3)
- Rents and royalties from Virginia property
- Gross receipts from the sale, lease, or rental of real or tangible personal property located in Virginia
- Other business income from Virginia sources

Excluded from the sales factor:
- Returns and allowances (deducted)
- Sales of investment assets (not part of ordinary business income)
- Receipts from sales of "intangible" property except where part of ordinary business operations
- Receipts already excluded from federal taxable income

### 3.3 Market-based sourcing of services and intangibles

For sales of services and intangibles, Virginia uses **market-based sourcing**:

- Services are sourced to where the **service is delivered** or where the customer receives the benefit
- Intangible licenses are sourced to where the intangible is used by the licensee
- Software-as-a-service (SaaS): sourced to the customer's location

Cost-of-performance sourcing (the pre-2013 default for non-manufacturers) is no longer used.

For purposes of "delivered to" a customer:

1. Where the contract designates delivery (if explicit)
2. Where the customer's invoicing address is located
3. Where the customer's commercial domicile is
4. Throwback to seller's state if origin in Virginia and no nexus elsewhere (Virginia does NOT have a throwback rule — sales to a state where the seller has no nexus stay "nowhere" sales and are still in the denominator but not numerator)

Virginia is a **no-throwback** state for sales factor purposes. This is an important multistate planning point: Virginia headquartered service businesses selling into states where they have no nexus can have significant "nowhere" sales that effectively reduce their Virginia apportionment percentage.

### 3.4 Special industry formulas

- **Manufacturers** (§58.1-422): single sales factor, market-based sourcing — applied since 2014
- **Retail companies** (§58.1-422.1): single sales factor since 2014
- **Motor carriers** (§58.1-417): single mileage factor (vehicle miles)
- **Financial corporations** (§58.1-418): special apportionment based on receipts, payroll, and property
- **Construction contractors** (§58.1-419): completed-contract method permitted; sales factor uses receipts attributable to construction performed in Virginia
- **Railroad and pipeline companies**: special formulas under §58.1-420 and §58.1-421

### 3.5 Alternative apportionment (§58.1-421)

A taxpayer may petition for alternative apportionment if the statutory formula does not fairly reflect Virginia business activity. The taxpayer bears the burden by clear and cogent evidence. The Tax Commissioner has discretion. Documented requests are filed with the return on Schedule 500ADJ with attached petition.

---

## 4. Combined Returns — Elective Consolidated

Virginia does **not** mandate unitary combined reporting. Instead, Va. Code §58.1-442 permits an elective consolidated or combined return for affiliated groups meeting certain ownership tests.

### 4.1 Three filing methods

A Virginia affiliated group (defined by reference to IRC §1504 with 80% ownership) may file:

1. **Separate returns** — each Virginia entity files its own Form 500
2. **Combined return** — Virginia group files one Form 500 combining only those affiliates with Virginia nexus; intercompany transactions are eliminated; apportionment factors are combined
3. **Consolidated return** — Virginia group includes ALL members of the federal consolidated group (regardless of whether they have Virginia nexus); apportionment is on a consolidated basis

### 4.2 Election is binding

The election made on the first return where two or more affiliated members have Virginia nexus is **binding for all future years**. Changes require the Tax Commissioner's permission and must demonstrate a substantial business reason (Va. Code §58.1-442(B)).

This is a critical first-year decision. The skill-user should flag the consolidation election in the workpapers for every first-Virginia-return engagement.

### 4.3 Practical considerations

- **Consolidated returns include "nowhere" income**: bringing in non-Virginia affiliates can dilute Virginia apportionment but also brings in losses
- **Combined returns**: only Virginia-nexus members participate; intercompany sales are eliminated from sales factor
- **NOLs**: a consolidated group's NOL is apportioned to Virginia using the consolidated apportionment factor in the loss year

### 4.4 No mandatory unitary

Unlike California, Massachusetts, New York, Texas (margin tax), and approximately 28 other states, Virginia does NOT require unitary combined reporting. A 2021 General Assembly study (HB 1800 §3-5.23) examined a mandatory unitary regime, and an informational filing was required for tax year 2021 only. As of tax year 2025, separate, combined, or consolidated remains elective.

## 5. Pass-Through Entity (PTE) Election

### 5.1 Background

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 imposed a $10,000 cap on the federal individual SALT deduction. In response, Virginia enacted Va. Code §58.1-390.3 (HB 1121, 2022) creating an elective entity-level tax on pass-through entities. The federal IRS blessed this approach in Notice 2020-75 ("SALT cap workaround").

The election is available for tax years **2021 and later** (the 2022 Virginia legislation made the election retroactive to 2021).

### 5.2 Who can elect

Eligible electing entities under §58.1-390.3(B):

- S-corporations (including SMLLCs that elected S-corp status)
- Partnerships (including general partnerships and LLPs)
- LLCs taxed as partnerships
- LLCs taxed as S-corporations

**Not eligible:**
- Single-member LLCs treated as disregarded entities for federal tax (because there is no separate entity-level federal return)
- C-corporations (different regime under §58.1-400)
- Sole proprietorships
- Tiered partnerships where the upper-tier partner is itself a PTE (the election is made at the entity that pays out to natural persons or C-corp partners)

### 5.3 Rate and base

**Rate: 5.75%** flat, matching the top Virginia individual rate. Va. Code §58.1-390.3(C).

**Base:** the entity's net income attributable to Virginia from all sources, computed at the entity level as if the entity were a resident individual for those items, then apportioned using the entity's Virginia apportionment factor.

For a single-state entity (all Virginia), the base is simply VA-source ordinary income + separately stated VA items.

For multistate entities, the apportionment factor is computed at the entity level using the same single sales factor as in §3.

### 5.4 Mechanics — Form 502PTET and refundable credit

- The entity files Form **502PTET** (separate from Form 502, which is informational)
- The entity pays 5.75% of its VTI at the entity level
- Each owner receives a Form PTE showing their share of PTE tax paid
- The owner claims a **refundable credit** on their Virginia individual return (Form 760 Line 25) for their proportionate share of PTE tax
- For federal purposes, the entity deducts the PTE tax as an ordinary state-tax expense on Form 1120S Line 12 or Form 1065 Line 14 (a state and local tax under §164(a)(3)), thereby reducing federal taxable income flowing to the owners by the amount of PTE tax — this is the SALT-cap workaround benefit

### 5.5 Election mechanics

- Election is annual (made by filing Form 502PTET)
- Estimated payments under Form 502W are due quarterly (April 15, June 15, September 15, December 15 for calendar year)
- Election deadline: original due date of the return (April 15 calendar year), or extended due date if extension filed
- Estimated PTE tax should be paid in equal quarterly installments to avoid underpayment penalty under §58.1-492

### 5.6 Composite returns (Form 765) vs. PTE election

Before §58.1-390.3, nonresident owners of Virginia PTEs typically participated in a **composite return** on Form 765 (Form 765-COMP), which avoided each nonresident filing a separate Form 763. The composite return remains available, but it does NOT generate a federal SALT deduction at the entity level.

| Feature | Composite Return (765) | PTE Election (502PTET) |
|---|---|---|
| Federal SALT benefit | None (treated as withholding) | Full (entity-level §164 deduction) |
| Available to | Nonresident PTE owners | All owners (resident and nonresident) |
| Rate | 5.75% on nonresident's VA share | 5.75% on entity's VA income |
| Owner filing | Owner can opt out and file own | Owners receive refundable credit |
| Tax year | Pre-2021 and continuing | 2021+ |

Most engagements with VA-resident owners and material taxable income will benefit from the PTE election. Run the breakeven: PTE election makes sense whenever the owner's federal marginal rate × VA-tax-paid exceeds the cost of the entity's compliance and any state-credit haircuts at the owner's home state level.

### 5.7 Nonresident owner credit

For owners who are residents of states OTHER than Virginia, the PTE election creates a credit at the resident state. Some resident states allow a full credit for the Virginia PTE tax against the resident state's tax (treating it as an income tax paid by the individual indirectly); others do not. Notable issues:

- **Maryland** — historically denied the credit before MD enacted its own PTE election in 2020; check current MD guidance
- **DC** — allows credit
- **North Carolina, Tennessee** — allows credit
- **California** — allows credit (treats VA PTE tax as paid by the owner)

Always verify the resident state's treatment before recommending an election for multistate ownership groups.

## 6. Filing and Estimated Tax

### 6.1 Form 500 — Corporate income tax

- **Due date**: 15th day of the 4th month after year-end. Calendar-year C-corps: **April 15**.
- **Extension**: 6-month automatic extension to **October 15** for calendar-year corporations (Va. Code §58.1-453). No form required — extension is automatic IF at least 90% of the tax is paid by the original due date.
- **Extension payment**: Form 500CP (extension payment voucher) — payment of estimated tax balance.
- **Failure-to-pay penalty**: 2% per month (or fraction) up to 30% maximum.
- **Failure-to-file penalty**: 6% per month up to 30% maximum if return not filed by the extended due date.
- **Interest**: federal underpayment rate plus 2% (recalculated quarterly).

### 6.2 Form 500ES — Estimated tax

Required if tax liability is expected to exceed **$1,000** for the year. Four equal installments:

| Installment | Calendar year due date |
|---|---|
| 1st | April 15 |
| 2nd | June 15 |
| 3rd | September 15 |
| 4th | December 15 |

**Safe harbor (Va. Code §58.1-504):**
- 100% of prior year tax (if return was for a full 12 months and showed a liability), OR
- 90% of current year tax

**Underpayment penalty**: federal underpayment rate plus 2%, computed on Form 500C.

### 6.3 Form 502 — PTE informational return

S-corporations, partnerships, and multi-member LLCs taxed as partnerships file **Form 502**. This is informational at the entity level (no tax due unless PTE elected or composite return filed) but is required.

- **Due date**: 15th day of the 4th month after year-end (April 15 calendar)
- **Extension**: automatic 6-month
- **Late-filing penalty**: $200 per K-1 not filed timely (Va. Code §58.1-394.1)

### 6.4 Form 502PTET — PTE election return

If the PTE election is made:

- Filed separately from (or in addition to) Form 502
- Same due dates and extension
- Estimated tax on Form 502W

### 6.5 Form 502V — Nonresident withholding

If the PTE does NOT elect the PTE tax AND does NOT file a composite return, the entity must withhold 5% on each nonresident owner's share of Virginia source income and remit using Form 502V. Threshold: $1,000 per owner.

## 7. BPOL Tax — Overview

### 7.1 Statutory basis

The Business, Professional, Occupational License tax is authorized by **Va. Code §58.1-3700 through §58.1-3735**. It is a **local** tax imposed by counties, independent cities, and incorporated towns. Each locality enacts its own ordinance and sets rates within the state-imposed maximums.

BPOL is NOT a state tax. It is collected by the local Commissioner of the Revenue (in counties) or Department of Finance (in cities), not by Virginia Tax (Department of Taxation).

### 7.2 Nature of the tax

BPOL is a **gross-receipts tax**, not an income tax. The base is gross receipts before deductions for cost of goods sold, payroll, rent, or other business expenses. Limited exclusions are statutory (see §11.4).

The tax is paid annually upon the issuance or renewal of a business license. Operating without a license is a separate licensing violation (often a misdemeanor under local ordinance).

### 7.3 Geographic scope and nexus

A business owes BPOL in any locality where it has a **definite place of business**. Va. Code §58.1-3700.1 defines "definite place of business" as "an office or location at which occurs a regular and continuous course of dealing for thirty consecutive days or more."

Out-of-state contractors performing work in a Virginia locality owe BPOL once they exceed the 90-day threshold under §58.1-3715 (see §13).

### 7.4 Rate structure

BPOL rates are set per **$100 of gross receipts** and vary by:

1. **Locality** (within state-imposed maximums by classification)
2. **Business classification** (contractor, retailer, professional, financial, repair/personal service, wholesale, etc.)

The General Assembly caps the rate per classification under §58.1-3706:

| Classification | Maximum rate per $100 |
|---|---|
| Contractors and persons constructing for their own account for sale | $0.16 |
| Retail sales | $0.20 |
| Financial services | $0.58 |
| Real estate services | $0.58 |
| Professional services (attorneys, CPAs, architects, engineers, consultants) | $0.58 |
| Repair, personal, and business services | $0.36 |
| Wholesale (basis is purchases, not gross receipts) | $0.05 (per $100 of purchases) |

Localities can set rates **below** these statutory maxima — and many do. The maxima are statutory ceilings that prevent localities from imposing unlimited rates.

### 7.5 Filing and renewal

The annual business license is typically renewed by **March 1** each year. Some localities (notably Fairfax County) require renewal by **March 1**; some allow April 15. The license year is generally the calendar year.

A new business must apply for an initial license within 30 days of starting operations in the locality. The first-year base is **estimated gross receipts**; reconciliation occurs at the next year's renewal.

## 9. BPOL Classifications

Va. Code §58.1-3706 and the Virginia BPOL Guidelines (most recently revised effective January 1, 2024) provide the classification rules. Misclassification is the most common BPOL error — and the most common audit adjustment.

### 9.1 Contractor (rate cap $0.16 per $100)

"Persons accepting orders or contracts for performing any services, including those that require the construction, repair, renovation, demolition, or removal of any building, structure, or other improvement to real property" (§58.1-3700.1).

Includes:
- General contractors
- Subcontractors (electrical, plumbing, HVAC, drywall, roofing, etc.)
- Excavation and grading
- Landscape installation (but landscape maintenance is "repair/personal services")
- Persons selling building materials to be installed by them
- Cable installers
- Roofing contractors
- Solar panel installers
- Persons constructing for their own account for sale (spec builders)

### 9.2 Retail merchant (rate cap $0.20 per $100)

Sale of goods to ultimate consumer, including:
- Brick-and-mortar retail
- E-commerce retailers with VA nexus (online sellers shipping to VA from a VA fulfillment center)
- Restaurants (gross receipts include both food sales and meals; alcohol included)
- Auto dealers (with adjustments for trade-ins)
- Convenience stores, grocers
- Coffee shops

### 9.3 Professional services (rate cap $0.58 per $100)

Defined as services rendered by a person engaged in any of the "professions" listed in §58.1-3732 or in any field requiring "high educational and technical attainment":

- Attorneys at law
- CPAs and public accountants
- Architects (registered)
- Professional engineers (licensed)
- Physicians, dentists, veterinarians
- Optometrists, chiropractors, podiatrists
- Real estate appraisers (registered)
- Insurance agents (some localities treat as financial)
- Stockbrokers (some localities financial)
- Management consultants
- IT consultants (in most localities — some treat as repair/business services; this is heavily contested)
- Investment advisors
- Actuaries
- Surveyors

**Software developers and IT consultants:** classification varies. Fairfax County and Loudoun County generally treat IT consulting as "business and personal services" ($0.19-$0.31), while Richmond and the Hampton Roads cities tend to apply the professional rate ($0.58). When IT consulting is at the level of architecture, system design, or licensed/credentialed work, the professional rate is more likely. When work is implementation, support, or commodity coding, the business-services rate is more likely. This is fact-specific — request a written classification ruling from the locality if material.

### 9.4 Financial services (rate cap $0.58 per $100)

- Banks (note: banks pay separate Bank Franchise Tax and are EXEMPT from BPOL under §58.1-3703(C)(7))
- Credit unions (exempt as well — §58.1-3703(C)(8))
- Securities dealers
- Mortgage brokers
- Money transmitters
- Pawnbrokers

The "financial services" BPOL classification primarily catches mortgage brokers, securities firms, and similar entities that don't qualify for the bank franchise tax exemption.

### 9.5 Real estate services (rate cap $0.58 per $100)

- Real estate brokers and agents
- Property managers
- Real estate developers (when selling property)
- Title companies

### 9.6 Repair, personal, business services (rate cap $0.36 per $100)

The catch-all classification for service businesses that don't fit professional, financial, or real estate:

- Auto repair, body shops
- Appliance repair
- Salons, barbers, spas
- Laundry, dry cleaning
- Photographers
- Caterers (not restaurants)
- Janitorial, cleaning, pest control
- Lawn care, landscape maintenance
- Staffing agencies
- Marketing and advertising agencies
- Most IT support and helpdesk businesses
- Pet groomers
- Tutoring (when not at a fixed school)
- Wedding planners, event planners

### 9.7 Wholesale (rate cap $0.05 per $100 of purchases)

Sale of goods for resale, including:
- Manufacturers selling to retailers
- Distributors
- Wholesale food distributors

**Key feature**: the wholesale tax is based on **purchases** (i.e., cost of goods sold), not gross receipts. This significantly limits the wholesale BPOL.

### 9.8 Multi-classification businesses

Where a single entity operates in multiple classifications (e.g., a retailer that also performs installation contracts, or a CPA firm that has consulting and audit lines), BPOL must be paid at each applicable rate on the corresponding portion of gross receipts. Books and records must segregate receipts by classification. If receipts are not segregated, the locality may apply the highest applicable rate to the entire gross.

## 10. BPOL Filing and Thresholds

### 10.1 Filing dates

| Locality | Renewal due date |
|---|---|
| Fairfax County | March 1 |
| Loudoun County | March 1 |
| Prince William County | March 1 |
| Arlington County | March 1 |
| Alexandria | March 1 |
| Falls Church | March 1 |
| Richmond | March 1 |
| Henrico | March 1 |
| Chesterfield | March 1 |
| Virginia Beach | March 1 |
| Norfolk | March 1 |
| Newport News | March 1 |
| Chesapeake | March 1 |
| Hampton | March 1 |
| Charlottesville | March 1 |
| Most other localities | March 1 (some April 15) |

**Late penalty**: typically 10% of tax due plus interest at 10% per annum. Many localities also impose a $30-$100 late-filing penalty in addition.

### 10.2 Gross-receipts threshold by locality

Va. Code §58.1-3706(D) allows localities to exempt businesses below specified thresholds. The thresholds are NOT uniform:

- Most counties (Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William, Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover): **$400,000** gross receipts threshold for the higher classifications, but **flat fee $30-$50** for businesses with gross receipts below the threshold but above a lower floor (typically $10,000)
- Most cities: lower thresholds, typically **$10,000 - $50,000** exempt entirely, then full rate above
- Towns: various

**Application of threshold**: under most ordinances, if gross receipts exceed the threshold, BPOL is calculated on the FULL gross receipts (the threshold is a true exemption ceiling, not an exclusion). This is sometimes called a "cliff" but in practice most localities apply the rate only to the portion of receipts that exceeds the threshold (verify in the locality ordinance — language varies).

### 10.3 Sample BPOL computation

A professional consulting LLC in Fairfax County with $500,000 of gross receipts:

```
Gross receipts                       $500,000
Threshold exemption (Fairfax)      ($   -   )  (none for professional above $100k)
Taxable gross receipts               $500,000
Rate (professional)                  $0.31 per $100
Tax = 500,000 / 100 × 0.31         = $1,550
```

Same LLC in Loudoun County:

```
Gross receipts                       $500,000
Rate (professional, Loudoun)         $0.17 per $100
Tax = 500,000 / 100 × 0.17         = $850
```

Same LLC in Arlington:

```
Gross receipts                       $500,000
Rate (professional, Arlington)       $0.36 per $100
Tax = 500,000 / 100 × 0.36         = $1,800
```

Same LLC in Richmond (city):

```
Gross receipts                       $500,000
Rate (professional, Richmond)        $0.58 per $100
Tax = 500,000 / 100 × 0.58         = $2,900
```

The locality choice can move BPOL by a factor of 3-4×. For mobile professional businesses, locality selection is a meaningful planning consideration (subject to where the work is actually performed and the "definite place of business" rules).

### 10.4 Deductions and exclusions from gross receipts

Va. Code §58.1-3732 permits the following exclusions from the BPOL base:

- Receipts from interstate commerce sourced under U.S. Constitution Commerce Clause (apportionment of gross receipts among states for businesses with multistate activity)
- Federal government contract receipts where federal law preempts state taxation (rare — most federal contracting is taxable)
- Bad debts (when written off in accordance with federal income tax rules)
- Reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses passed through at cost to clients (where separately stated and supported by records)
- Bona fide sales tax collected
- Refunds and returns

**Not deductible** (gross receipts include):
- Salaries paid to employees
- Cost of goods sold (for retail/contractor — except wholesale rule)
- Rent and operating expenses
- Subcontractor payments (some localities allow deduction — see §10.5)

### 10.5 Subcontractor deduction (contractors only)

Va. Code §58.1-3715 allows general contractors to **deduct** payments to subcontractors from their gross receipts IF the subcontractor is itself licensed and pays BPOL on those same receipts. This avoids pyramiding of the contractor tax on the same dollar of receipts as it flows up the contracting chain.

The general contractor must:
1. Obtain the subcontractor's license number
2. Document payments to subcontractors
3. Report deducted subcontractor payments on a Schedule SC (form varies by locality)

The locality may verify by cross-checking the subcontractor's BPOL filing.

---

## 11. Out-of-State Contractor BPOL

### 11.1 The 90-day rule

Va. Code §58.1-3715 imposes BPOL on out-of-state contractors performing work in a Virginia locality. A contractor with **no Virginia office** is subject to BPOL in any Virginia locality where it performs construction work for **30 days or more in the license year**.

(The 30-day threshold for "definite place of business" applies; the 90-day reference sometimes seen in older guidance referred to a different statute, and the controlling rule is the §58.1-3700.1 definite-place-of-business test.)

### 11.2 Each jurisdiction is separate

Critical practice point: a Virginia contractor or out-of-state contractor working in **multiple** Virginia localities owes BPOL in **each** locality separately, based on the receipts earned from work performed in that locality. There is no "central" Virginia license. A general contractor with a Fairfax County office that performs work in Loudoun County, Arlington County, and the City of Falls Church owes BPOL in all four jurisdictions.

Allocation: each locality is entitled to BPOL on the gross receipts attributable to construction performed within its boundaries. For mobile work (HVAC servicing multiple sites), the contractor must allocate based on physical work location.

### 11.3 Subcontractor pass-through

When the general contractor takes the §58.1-3715 subcontractor deduction (see §10.5), the subcontractor must be licensed in the locality of the work. An unlicensed subcontractor disqualifies the general from the deduction.

### 11.4 Practical scenario

A Maryland-based HVAC contractor performs $300,000 of work in Fairfax County over 60 days and $100,000 of work in Arlington over 40 days. License year: calendar 2025.

```
Fairfax County:
  Gross receipts attributable to Fairfax       $300,000
  Rate (contractor)                            $0.11 per $100
  BPOL                                         $330

Arlington County:
  Gross receipts attributable to Arlington     $100,000
  Rate (contractor)                            $0.16 per $100
  BPOL                                         $160

Total Virginia BPOL                           $490
```

The contractor must apply for a license in each county. Maryland's tax (if any) on the same receipts is a separate matter under Maryland law.

## 12. Worked Examples

### 12.1 Example 1: Small Fairfax consulting LLC — single-member LLC plus owner PIT

**Facts:**
- Sarah is a Virginia resident
- She operates "Sarah Consulting LLC" — a single-member LLC, disregarded for federal income tax
- The LLC has its only office in Fairfax County, VA
- 2025 gross receipts: $350,000
- 2025 federal Schedule C net profit: $225,000 (after $75,000 wages to a contractor, $30,000 rent, $20,000 other expenses)
- Sarah has no other Virginia income
- Sarah is single, no dependents, takes the Virginia standard deduction ($8,500 single, 2025)

**Step 1: BPOL (Fairfax County, professional consulting)**

```
Gross receipts                       $350,000
Classification (consulting)          Professional (Fairfax: $0.31/$100)
Above $100,000 threshold            Yes (full rate)
BPOL = 350,000 / 100 × 0.31       = $1,085
Due date: March 1, 2025 (for 2024 receipts) or March 1, 2026 (for 2025)
```

**Step 2: Federal tax**
- Federal Schedule C net profit: $225,000
- Federal SE tax: 92.35% × $225,000 × 15.3% (capped) ≈ $25,500 (after SS cap effect)
- Deductible half: $12,750
- Federal AGI: $225,000 - $12,750 = $212,250
- (Federal income tax not computed here)

**Step 3: Virginia individual income tax**

Single-member LLC is disregarded — Sarah reports the Schedule C income directly on her Virginia Form 760.

```
Federal AGI                                   $212,250
Virginia additions (e.g., other-state munis)      $-
Virginia subtractions                             $-
   (BPOL tax — not deductible against VA PIT; deductible on federal Sch C as a tax expense, so already in federal AGI as expense)
Virginia AGI                                  $212,250
Less: Virginia standard deduction            ($  8,500)
Virginia taxable income                       $203,750

Virginia tax (2025 brackets):
  First $3,000           × 2.0%       = $    60
  Next $2,000  (to $5k)  × 3.0%       = $    60
  Next $12,000 (to $17k) × 5.0%       = $   600
  Above $17,000          × 5.75%      = $10,733  (on $186,750)
                                       --------
  Total Virginia tax                  = $11,453
```

**Step 4: PTE election available?**

No — single-member LLCs disregarded for federal tax cannot elect PTE under §58.1-390.3. Sarah pays Virginia PIT at the individual level.

**Step 5: Total Virginia + BPOL burden**

| Tax | Amount |
|---|---|
| BPOL (Fairfax County) | $1,085 |
| Virginia individual income tax | $11,453 |
| **Total state and local** | **$12,538** |

Effective state+local rate on Schedule C net profit: 12,538 / 225,000 = **5.57%**

If Sarah relocated to Loudoun County (same income, no Fairfax presence):

| Tax | Amount |
|---|---|
| BPOL (Loudoun) — $350k × $0.17/$100 | $595 |
| Virginia PIT (unchanged — same VA resident) | $11,453 |
| **Total** | **$12,048** |

Savings from Loudoun: $490 (just BPOL difference).

### 12.2 Example 2: Multistate manufacturer using single sales factor

**Facts:**
- "Acme Widgets, Inc." is a Virginia C-corp headquartered in Richmond
- Manufactures widgets at a Richmond plant
- 2025 gross sales: $50,000,000 (everywhere)
- Federal taxable income (before NOL): $5,000,000
- Property in Virginia: $20,000,000 (Richmond plant)
- Property everywhere: $30,000,000 (Richmond + Ohio warehouse)
- Payroll in Virginia: $8,000,000
- Payroll everywhere: $12,000,000
- Sales destinations:
  - Virginia customers: $10,000,000 (20%)
  - Other states with nexus: $25,000,000 (50%)
  - Other states with NO nexus: $15,000,000 (30% — "nowhere sales")

**Step 1: Apportionment — single sales factor (manufacturer rules under §58.1-422 since 2014)**

```
Virginia sales numerator             $10,000,000
Everywhere sales denominator         $50,000,000  (includes the $15M nowhere)
Single sales factor                  20.00%
```

**Step 2: Compare to historic 3-factor (illustrative — NOT applicable to manufacturers since 2014, but useful to compare for non-manufacturers in pre-2025 transition years):**

```
Property factor:   20M / 30M    = 66.67%
Payroll factor:    8M / 12M     = 66.67%
Sales factor:      10M / 50M    = 20.00%
Equal-weighted average           = 51.11%
Double-weighted sales            = 43.33%
```

Single sales factor (20.00%) drives a dramatically lower Virginia apportionment than a property/payroll weighted formula would for an in-state manufacturer. This is the policy intent — incentivize Virginia-located property and payroll.

**Step 3: Virginia Taxable Income**

```
Federal taxable income (before fed NOL)            $5,000,000
Virginia additions (e.g., state taxes deducted)     $  300,000
Virginia subtractions (US bond interest, etc.)     ($  100,000)
Apportionable Virginia base                        $5,200,000
Apportionment %                                    × 20.00%
Apportioned Virginia income                        $1,040,000

Virginia tax = 1,040,000 × 6%                    = $62,400
```

**Step 4: No BPOL because... actually BPOL applies!**

Even though Acme is paying corporate income tax, it still owes Richmond city BPOL on its gross receipts.

Manufacturing classification: manufacturers selling their own goods are generally classified as "manufacturer/wholesaler" under §58.1-3703(C)(4). Under that classification, **wholesale BPOL applies to manufacturer sales at wholesale**, on a base of purchases — but a manufacturer selling its own product has no "purchases" of finished goods. Many localities (Richmond included) impose BPOL on manufacturers at a separate, lower rate, often **$0.20 per $100 of gross receipts attributable to wholesale sales from the Virginia plant**, capped under §58.1-3703.

Richmond's 2024 ordinance applies $0.20/$100 to manufacturer-wholesale receipts arising in Richmond.

```
Receipts attributable to Richmond manufacturing operation = $50,000,000 (all manufacturing is in Richmond)
BPOL = 50,000,000 / 100 × 0.20             = $100,000
```

**Reviewer check:** the §58.1-3703(C)(4) exemption is heavily fact-specific. Manufacturers selling at WHOLESALE from a Virginia plant are EXEMPT from BPOL on those wholesale receipts under §58.1-3703(C)(4). Acme should claim the manufacturer exemption if and only if it is selling at wholesale (i.e., to retailers for resale). If Acme sells directly to ultimate consumers, the receipts are retail and BPOL applies at the retail rate.

Assuming Acme's $50M is all wholesale (to distributors and retailers), Acme's BPOL = **$0** under the §58.1-3703(C)(4) manufacturer exemption.

**Step 5: Total state and local burden**

| Tax | Amount |
|---|---|
| Virginia corporate income tax | $62,400 |
| Richmond BPOL (manufacturer exemption) | $0 |
| **Total** | **$62,400** |

Effective state-and-local rate on $5M federal income: 62,400 / 5,000,000 = **1.25%**.

The single sales factor combined with the manufacturer BPOL exemption makes Virginia very competitive for manufacturing.

### 12.3 Example 3: S-corp electing PTE tax

**Facts:**
- "Tidewater Engineering, S-Corp" — a Virginia S-corp with two equal shareholders
- Both shareholders are Virginia residents
- 2025 ordinary income (Form 1120S Line 21): $400,000 (all VA source, single-state operation)
- S-corp paid each shareholder a $100,000 reasonable salary, reported on W-2 (already deducted in arriving at $400,000)
- The PTE election is made for 2025 on Form 502PTET

**Step 1: PTE tax at entity level**

```
Virginia source income at S-corp level           $400,000
PTE rate                                         × 5.75%
PTE tax (Form 502PTET)                           $ 23,000
```

Estimated payments (Form 502W) should have been remitted quarterly during 2025 ($5,750 each quarter on April 15, June 15, September 15, December 15).

**Step 2: Federal deduction**

The S-corp deducts $23,000 of PTE tax on Form 1120S as a state tax expense (Line 12, "Taxes and licenses"). This reduces federal ordinary income flowing to the shareholders.

Adjusted federal Schedule K-1 ordinary income (per shareholder): ($400,000 - $23,000) / 2 = $188,500 each (down from $200,000 each absent the election).

Federal SALT cap benefit per shareholder at a 37% top federal bracket:
- Federal tax saved on the entity-level deduction: $23,000 × 37% / 2 shareholders = $4,255 per shareholder, $8,510 total.

This is the SALT-cap workaround benefit. Without the PTE election, each shareholder would have paid the $11,500 of VA PIT individually (which would have been subject to the $10,000 federal SALT cap and largely lost as a federal deduction).

**Step 3: Virginia individual returns — refundable PTE credit**

Each shareholder receives Form PTE showing $11,500 of PTE tax paid on their behalf.

For each shareholder's Virginia Form 760:

```
Virginia AGI from Schedule K-1 ordinary income     $200,000
   (Federal-deducted PTE tax is ADDED BACK on Schedule ADJ for VA-PIT purposes
    to avoid double-benefit — Va. Code §58.1-322.02 add-back)
Add: PTE tax deducted federally                  + $ 11,500
   (added back so VA PIT base is the pre-PTE income)
Virginia taxable income (after standard deduction) $200,000 + 11,500 - 8,500
                                                  = $203,000
Plus W-2 wages                                    + $100,000
Total VA taxable income                            $303,000

Virginia tax on $303,000:
  $3,000 × 2.0%   = $60
  $2,000 × 3.0%   = $60
  $12,000 × 5.0%  = $600
  $286,000 × 5.75% = $16,445
Total VA tax                                       $17,165

Less: refundable PTE credit (from Form PTE)      ($11,500)
Net VA tax due (per shareholder)                   $ 5,665
```

**Step 4: Comparison — no election scenario**

Without the PTE election, the S-corp would have $400,000 of federal ordinary income flowing through. Each shareholder receives $200,000 + $100,000 W-2 = $300,000 of VA taxable income.

VA tax per shareholder (no election): $16,883 (vs $17,165 with election — slightly higher because the election grossed up VA base by the PTE deduction).

But: without the election, each shareholder must pay the $11,500 of VA tax themselves. Total federal SALT impact: their VA tax becomes a state income tax deduction, subject to the $10,000 cap, mostly lost.

With the election, the S-corp gets the $23,000 federal deduction unconditionally. Federal tax saved: ~$8,510. Net benefit per shareholder: ~$4,000.

**Decision**: elect PTE for 2025. Net federal-tax savings ~$8,500 across both shareholders, at a Virginia-tax cost essentially neutral (slight grossup wash). Time spent on Form 502PTET preparation is incremental on top of Form 502 already required.

**Step 5: BPOL**

Engineering services are "professional" for BPOL purposes. Assume the S-corp's office is in Norfolk:

```
Gross receipts (assume $1,200,000)                $1,200,000
Norfolk professional rate                         $0.58/$100
BPOL                                              = $6,960
```

This BPOL is a deductible business expense for federal purposes (reduces the $400,000 ordinary income — assume already reflected above).

### 13.5 Caveats and confidence

The following items in this skill should be flagged for reviewer confirmation:

1. **2025 conformity bill citation** — the exact HB/SB number for the 2025 conformity advancement should be verified before reliance (see §2.5).
2. **BPOL rate tables (§8)** — locality rates change frequently. The figures are illustrative for tax year 2025 based on published 2024 ordinances; always verify with the locality's Commissioner of the Revenue.
3. **IT consulting classification** — the professional-vs-business-services classification varies by locality and is contested (see §9.3). Request a written ruling for any material engagement.
4. **Manufacturer BPOL exemption** — fact-specific under §58.1-3703(C)(4); requires that sales be at wholesale (see §12.2).
5. **PTE election interaction with nonresident state credits** — verify each nonresident owner's home-state treatment (§5.7).
