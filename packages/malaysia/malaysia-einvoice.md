## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### IRBM Validation Checks

2. **Mandatory field completeness** — All 55 required fields present
3. **Digital signature verification** — Valid certificate from approved authority
4. **TIN validation** — Both supplier and buyer TIN must be valid and active
5. **BRN/NRIC consistency** — Must match IRBM records
6. **Tax calculation** — Tax amounts must equal rate × base (within tolerance)
7. **Code table validation** — MSIC codes, state codes, currency codes, tax types must be from valid lists
8. **Duplicate check** — Same document ID from same supplier not accepted twice
9. **Date/time validation** — Must be in UTC; not future-dated beyond tolerance

### Validation Statuses

| Valid | Passed all checks; legally valid e-invoice |

| Cancelled | Cancelled by supplier (within permitted window) |

| Invalid digital signature | Certificate expired or unrecognized | Renew certificate from approved CA |

### Applicable Taxes

| Tax Type | Code | Rate | Applicable To |

- Total Including Tax = Total Excluding Tax + Total Tax Amount
- Multiple tax types can appear on same invoice (different lines)

### Multi-Rate Invoice

- Each line item carries its own Tax Type and Tax Rate
- Invoice totals aggregate across all tax types

- Charges (e.g., freight, handling) added as separate line items or invoice-level charges
- Tax calculated on net amount (after discount, before charges where applicable)

### Foreign Currency

- If DocumentCurrencyCode ≠ MYR, include exchange rate
- Tax amounts may need to be expressed in MYR for SST purposes
- Use Bank Negara Malaysia published rates
