## Section 3 -- CP500 (Self-Employed Instalments)

### 3.1 What Is CP500

CP500 is the instalment tax payment system for individuals with business or non-employment income. LHDN issues a CP500 notice specifying the amounts and due dates.

### 3.2 Who Receives CP500

| Category | Obligation |
|---|---|
| Sole proprietors (business income) | Mandatory |
| Partners in partnerships | Mandatory (based on share of partnership income) |
| Individuals with rental income | May receive CP500 |
| Individuals with investment income | May receive CP500 if significant |
| First-year businesses | May not receive CP500 until first Form B is filed |

### 3.3 Basis of CP500

LHDN calculates CP500 based on:

| Basis | Detail |
|---|---|
| Prior year tax liability | LHDN uses the latest assessed or estimated tax from the prior Form B |
| Standard uplift | LHDN may increase by 5-10% to account for expected income growth |
| New businesses | Based on estimated income declared in Form B or registration |

### 3.4 Payment Schedule

CP500 is payable in **6 bimonthly instalments**:

| Instalment | Month | Due Date |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | March | 15 March |
| 2nd | May | 15 May |
| 3rd | July | 15 July |
| 4th | September | 15 September |
| 5th | November | 15 November |
| 6th | January (following year) | 15 January |

The due date is the **15th of the instalment month**. If the 15th falls on a weekend or public holiday, the next business day applies.

### 3.5 Payment Methods

| Online banking (FPX) | Via MyTax portal or ByrHASiL |
| Bank counter | Using CP500 payment slip with reference number |
| ATM / CDM | Selected banks |

## Section 4 -- Revising CP500

### 4.1 When to Revise

- Business income significantly higher or lower than LHDN's estimate
- Business started or ceased mid-year
- Major change in expenses or deductions

### 4.2 How to Revise

| Portal | Submit via MyTax or LHDN branch |
| Effect | LHDN revises remaining instalments; amounts already paid are credited |

### 4.3 Revision Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Underestimation penalty | If revised estimate is >30% below actual tax, a 10% penalty applies on the difference (Section 107B(3)) |
| Cannot revise after 30 June | Remaining instalments must be paid as per last revision |

## Section 6 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Sole Proprietor CP500

**Situation:** Graphic designer, YA 2024 tax liability was RM8,400. LHDN issues CP500 for YA 2025 based on this amount.

**CP500 schedule:** 6 × RM1,400 = RM8,400 total
- 15 Mar: RM1,400
- 15 May: RM1,400
- 15 Jul: RM1,400
- 15 Sep: RM1,400
- 15 Nov: RM1,400
- 15 Jan 2026: RM1,400

**Actual YA 2025 tax liability:** RM10,200. Balance of RM1,800 due upon filing Form B (30 June 2026).

### Example 2 -- CP500 Revision

**Situation:** Consultant expects income to drop significantly. Revised estimate: RM4,500 tax for the year.

**Action:** Submits Form CP502 by 30 June 2025. Remaining 3 instalments reduced. Already paid RM4,200 (3 × RM1,400). New instalments: RM100 each for Jul, Sep, Nov.

**Risk:** If actual tax turns out to be RM7,000, difference from revised estimate (RM7,000 - RM4,500 = RM2,500) is >30% of actual (30% × RM7,000 = RM2,100). Since RM2,500 > RM2,100, a 10% penalty on RM2,500 = RM250 may apply.

## Section 7 -- Interaction with Other Systems

| System | Interaction |
|---|---|
| Form B filing | CP500 paid is credited against final tax liability on Form B |
| EPF/SOCSO/EIS | See **my-epf-socso** skill; these are separate from income tax instalments |
| Section 108 (withholding) | Tax withheld by payer on certain payments is also credited against final tax |

## Prohibitions

- NEVER treat CP500 payments as deductible expenses -- they are credits against final tax
- NEVER advise skipping CP500 payments -- 10% penalty applies immediately
- NEVER revise CP500 below 70% of expected actual tax without warning about underestimation penalty
- NEVER submit Form CP502 after 30 June of the assessment year
- NEVER assume first-year businesses will automatically receive CP500 -- they may need to register
- NEVER present calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
