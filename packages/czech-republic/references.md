## OSVČ Kalkulačka

- License: verify before reuse
- Language: Czech
- Scope: OSVČ (self-employed / osoby samostatně výdělečně činné) DPFO income tax calculator with social and health insurance contribution computation. Verifies results against official EPO XML exports from the Finanční správa.
- Why it matters: Focuses on the self-employed tax return workflow, which is the most complex individual filing scenario in CZ. Validation against EPO XML adds confidence in the calculations.
- Integration approach:
  - Reference for OSVČ tax computation, social/health insurance bases, and paušální výdaje (flat-rate expense) percentages.
  - Treat as reference-only until the license is confirmed.
