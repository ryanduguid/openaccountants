Zero-rated only with customs declaration, bill of lading, proof of delivery.

Input VAT on purchases for exempt banking not recoverable.

Entertainment blocked for input recovery.

First sale may be taxable. Escalate.

### Test suite

LBP 10M net. Expected: output LBP 1.1M (11%).

USD 5,000 to France. Expected: 0%. Input recoverable.

UK firm USD 10,000. Expected: 11% self-assessed. Exchange rate: flag.

Bank interest LBP 500M. Expected: no output. Input LBP 2.2M not recoverable.

Turkish goods CIF LBP 100M + duty LBP 5M. Expected: VAT base LBP 105M, VAT LBP 11.55M.

Dinner LBP 5M + VAT LBP 550K. Expected: input = 0.

### Escalation protocol

```
REVIEWER FLAG / ESCALATION REQUIRED
[Standard format -- include note about economic crisis verification]
```

### Out of scope -- direct tax

- Corporate income tax: 17%
- Personal income tax: progressive 2%-25%
- Social security (NSSF): employer and employee contributions

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply any rate other than 11% (until 12% enacted)
- NEVER allow input recovery on exempt supplies
- NEVER use exchange rate without practitioner confirmation
- NEVER assume pre-crisis rules apply unchanged
- NEVER assume MOF systems operational without confirming
- NEVER compute numbers -- engine handles arithmetic
