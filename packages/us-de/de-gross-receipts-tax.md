**Important:** Rates and exclusions vary by specific business activity. The above are the most common categories. Sole proprietors must identify their primary business activity and register for the correct category. If a business conducts multiple activities, separate licenses and filings are required for each.

### How the exclusion works
- The monthly exclusion reduces the taxable base before applying the rate
- Example: A general services sole proprietor with $150,000 gross receipts in a month pays tax on $50,000 ($150,000 − $100,000 exclusion) × 0.3983% = $199.15
- Quarterly filers get 3× the monthly exclusion ($300,000 for most categories)

## Section 3: Who must register and file

### Registration requirement
Any person or entity engaged in business in Delaware must obtain a business license from the Delaware Division of Revenue **before** commencing operations. This includes:
- Sole proprietors
- Corporations
- Partnerships
- LLCs
- Independent contractors providing services in Delaware

### What constitutes "gross receipts"
Total receipts from goods sold and services rendered in Delaware. **No deductions allowed** for:
- Cost of goods sold
- Labor costs
- Interest expense
- Discounts paid
- Delivery costs
- State or federal taxes paid
- Any other business expenses

### Exemptions
The following are NOT subject to GRT:
- Casual sales (isolated transactions not in the ordinary course of business)
- Sales to the U.S. government
- Sales to the State of Delaware
- Insurance premiums (taxed separately)
- Certain agricultural products sold by the producer

## Section 4: Filing frequency and due dates

| Filing frequency | Threshold | Due date |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly | Tax liability > $5,000/month | 20th of the following month |
| Quarterly | Tax liability $1,500–$5,000/quarter | Last day of month following quarter end |
| Annually | Tax liability < $1,500/quarter | January 31 of following year |

New businesses typically start on a quarterly filing schedule. The Division of Revenue uses a "look-back period" to determine frequency changes.

### Quarterly due dates (calendar year)
| Quarter | Period | Due date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | January – March | April 30 |
| Q2 | April – June | July 31 |
| Q3 | July – September | October 31 |
| Q4 | October – December | January 31 |

## Section 5: Self-employed specific considerations

### Multiple business activities
If a sole proprietor performs both retail sales and professional services, separate GRT licenses and filings are required for each activity at the respective rate.

### Online/remote sellers
If you sell tangible goods to Delaware customers from outside Delaware, you may be subject to GRT based on nexus rules. Physical presence in Delaware triggers GRT; economic nexus rules may also apply.

### Interaction with income tax
GRT paid is a deductible business expense on federal Schedule C (and therefore reduces Delaware taxable income). It is NOT a pass-through tax to the customer (unlike sales tax), though some businesses choose to include it in pricing.

### Record-keeping
Maintain monthly gross receipts records by business activity category. The Division of Revenue may audit and reclassify business activity if the registered category does not match actual operations.
