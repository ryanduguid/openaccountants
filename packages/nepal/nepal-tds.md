  ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Nepal TDS / withholding tax work. Use whenever asked to compute or deduct Nepal withholding tax (TDS) on rent, interest, dividends, service/contract payments, or payments to non-residents under the Income Tax Act 2058. Trigger on phrases like "Nepal TDS", "Nepal withholding", "TDS rates Nepal", "Section 88 Nepal", "rent TDS Nepal 10%", "dividend TDS Nepal 5%", "interest TDS Nepal 6%", "contract TDS Nepal 1.5%", or "FY 2082/83 TDS". Out of scope — personal income tax computation (separate skill), corporate tax (separate skill), payroll/SSF salary TDS (use the payroll skill), and VAT.

# Nepal — TDS / Withholding Tax — Skill v1.0

> **Produced by OpenAccountants (openaccountants.com).** Research-grade (tier 2) for FY 2082/83. **Source provenance:** figures derive from Nepali professional-firm publications (PKF T.R. Upadhya, Union Nepal) reflecting the Income Tax Act 2058 §87–§88 and Finance Act 2082 — not re-anchored to primary IRD pages. A Nepali CA must confirm against the statute before reliance. Not tax advice.

## Section 1 — Quick reference (rates, FY 2082/83 — "no change" from FY 2024-25)

| Payment type | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Rent** (paid by a resident person) | **10%** | |
| **Dividend** (paid by resident company / partnership) | **5%** | Same to resident AND non-resident |
| **Interest** (Nepal source, from resident banks / FIs / cooperatives / debenture issuers / listed companies) | **6%** to a natural person (not in business); **15%** to entities | |
| **Contract / agreement payment to a non-resident** | **5%** | |
| **Contract payments exceeding NPR 50,000** | **1.5%** | Resident contract/supply payments |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country / authority | Nepal — Inland Revenue Department (IRD), ird.gov.np |
| Statute | Income Tax Act 2058 (2002) §87–§88, as amended by Finance Act 2082 |
| Income year | Shrawan 1 – Ashad end (BS); FY 2082/83 |
| Validated by | Pending — Nepali CA / registered tax practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

> **Refuted / do NOT use:** a flat 15% Section 88 TDS on interest/rent/service, and a 10% dividend TDS — both appear in some secondary commentary but were adversarially refuted; the effective FY 2082/83 rates above govern.

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Recipient natural person vs entity (interest) | Treat as entity (15%) and flag |
| Resident vs non-resident recipient | Flag; non-resident service/royalty/technical fees beyond the 5% contract rate are VERIFY |
| Contract payment near NPR 50,000 threshold | Apply 1.5% if it exceeds 50,000 |

## Section 2 — Refusal catalogue

**R-NP-TDS-1 — Salary TDS.** Employment withholding sequences with SSF — use `nepal-payroll`.
**R-NP-TDS-2 — Non-resident service/royalty/technical fees + DTAA.** Beyond the 5% non-resident contract rate, the full non-resident Section 88 schedule and treaty overrides were NOT established — VERIFY; escalate.
**R-NP-TDS-3 — Full Section 88 schedule.** Many payment categories exist beyond those listed; this skill covers the common ones. Confirm the full §88 table for FY 2082/83.

---

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rules

### 3.1 Rent — 10%
TDS of **10%** on rent paid by a resident person.

### 3.2 Dividend — 5%
TDS of **5%** on dividends paid by a resident company/partnership — to both resident and non-resident recipients.

### 3.3 Interest — 6% / 15%
On Nepal-source interest paid by resident banks, financial institutions, cooperatives, debenture issuers, or listed companies:
- **6%** to a natural person who is not deriving the interest in the course of business;
- **15%** to entities.

### 3.4 Contracts
- Payment under a **contract/agreement to a non-resident**: **5%**.
- Resident **contract/supply payments exceeding NPR 50,000**: **1.5%**.

## Section 4 — Worked examples

- Rent NPR 200,000 to a resident landlord → TDS = 10% × 200,000 = **NPR 20,000**.
- Bank interest NPR 100,000 to an individual (not in business) → TDS = 6% × 100,000 = **NPR 6,000**.
- Dividend NPR 500,000 → TDS = 5% × 500,000 = **NPR 25,000**.
- Resident supply contract NPR 300,000 → TDS = 1.5% × 300,000 = **NPR 4,500**.

---

## Section 5 — Filing

TDS is deducted at payment and deposited to the IRD with a credit certificate to the payee. **Deposit/return due dates — VERIFY** against the IRD calendar (not established by the research).

---

## Section 6 — Sources

Research-grade, FY 2082/83. **Secondary firm publications — re-anchor to primary IRD/statute (§87–§88):**
1. PKF T.R. Upadhya & Co. "Tax Rates 2082-83" §7.1 — https://pkf.trunco.com.np/files/publications/1748841198_Tax%20Rates%202082-83_Final_250601_213028.pdf
2. Union Nepal — TDS in Nepal — https://unionnepal.com/tds-in-nepal
3. Income Tax Act 2058 (2002) §88 — confirm at https://ird.gov.np

**Known gaps / VERIFY:** full §88 schedule; non-resident service/royalty/technical-fee rates + DTAA; deposit/return due dates.

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER use the refuted flat 15% (interest/rent/service) or 10% dividend rates — use the rates in §1.
- NEVER apply the 6% interest rate to an entity recipient — entities are 15%.
- NEVER assert non-resident service/royalty/technical-fee TDS this skill flags as VERIFY.
- NEVER present these as primary-IRD-confirmed — flag for verifier re-anchoring.
- NEVER file or instruct filing — working paper for practitioner review only.
