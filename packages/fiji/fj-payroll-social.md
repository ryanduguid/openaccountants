### Statutory Payroll Components at a Glance (resident employee)

**Statutory Payroll Components at a Glance**

| Component | Employee | Employer | Base / threshold |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Income tax (PAYE) | 0% -- 20% progressive | withhold & remit | tax-free to $30,000; 20% marginal cap [FRCS Tax Rates] |
| Social Responsibility Tax (SRT) | 18% -- 24% | withhold & remit | only chargeable income > $270,000 [FRCS Tax Rates] |
| Environment & Climate Adaptation Levy (ECAL) on income | 10% | withhold & remit | only chargeable income > $270,000 [HLB Fiji; **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against live FRCS ECAL page]**] |
| FNPF | 8% | 10% | gross ordinary wages, no cap [FNPF Employers, eff. 1 Jan 2024] |

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | STOP -- ask. Non-residents have NO tax-free threshold (flat 20%) |
| Unknown whether income exceeds $270,000 | Treat as below $270,000 (no SRT/ECAL) and flag to reviewer if near threshold |
| Unknown FNPF membership / age | Treat employee aged 15+ as FNPF-mandatory; STOP if under 15 |
| Unknown whether figure is "ordinary wages" vs total remuneration | Use ordinary/gross wages for FNPF; STOP if composition unclear |
| Unknown pay frequency | Assume monthly; annualise for bracket computation |
| Voluntary FNPF top-ups | Assume none unless evidenced |
| Sector minimum wage applies | STOP -- check for a Wages Regulation Order before assuming national minimum |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

- **Minimum viable inputs** — gross (ordinary) wages for the period, pay frequency, residency status (resident / non-resident), and confirmation the employee is an FNPF member (or eligible, aged 15+).
- **Recommended inputs** — annualised gross, FNPF member number, FRCS Tax Identification Number (TIN), employment start date, age, and any voluntary FNPF election.
- **Ideal inputs** — full payslip history for the year (for cumulative PAYE reconciliation), employment contract showing ordinary wage vs allowances, sector/industry (to check Wages Regulation Orders), and bank statements showing salary credits and statutory remittances.

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-FJ-1 -- Residency unknown** — Resident employees get a $30,000 tax-free threshold; non-residents are taxed at a flat 20% from the first dollar [FRCS]. Confirm residency status before computing PAYE.  _(FRCS)_
- **R-FJ-2 -- High-earner thresholds** — SRT and ECAL on income apply only above $270,000 chargeable income [FRCS Tax Rates; HLB Fiji]. If annual chargeable income is at or near $270,000, escalate to a licensed accountant — the stacked PAYE + SRT + ECAL computation must be reviewed.  _(FRCS Tax Rates; HLB Fiji)_
- **R-FJ-3 -- ECAL provenance** — The ECAL-on-income rate (10% above $270,000) could not be confirmed verbatim from the live FRCS ECAL page during research [RESEARCH GAP]. Do not present ECAL figures as definitive — flag for reviewer confirmation.
- **R-FJ-4 -- Penalty figures** — Specific FRCS PAYE penalties and the FNPF late-payment penalty rate were not confirmed from primary sources [RESEARCH GAP]. Do not state exact penalty amounts — refer to 'penalties under the Tax Administration Act 2009 / FNPF Act 2011' and escalate.
- **R-FJ-5 -- Termination / final pay / redundancy** — Termination pay, redundancy, and leave-on-termination computations are outside this skill's scope. Escalate to a licensed accountant.
- **R-FJ-6 -- Fringe benefits / non-cash remuneration** — Fringe benefit tax and the taxation of non-cash benefits are outside this skill's scope. Escalate to a licensed accountant.

## Section 3 -- PAYE Income Tax Withholding (Residents)

- **PAYE deduction and final tax rule** — The employer deducts PAYE each pay period using the FRCS tax tables / the 2024 PAYE Regulation 6 formula and an approved calculator/Excel filing template [FRCS]. PAYE is a final tax for employees whose only income is employment income — those employees do not file an annual return [FRCS, "New PAYE Structure" notice].  _(FRCS, "New PAYE Structure" notice)_

### 3.1 Resident PAYE Brackets (current, YA 2022 onward; unchanged 2024/2025) [FRCS Tax Rates -- https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/]

**Resident PAYE Brackets**  _(FRCS Tax Rates -- https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/)_

| Chargeable income (FJD) | Income tax |
| --- | --- |
| 0 -- 30,000 | Nil (tax-free threshold = $30,000) |
| 30,001 -- 50,000 | 18% of excess over $30,000 |
| 50,001 -- 270,000 | $3,600 + 20% of excess over $50,000 |
| 270,001 -- 300,000 | $47,600 + 20% of excess over $270,000 |
| 300,001 -- 350,000 | $53,600 + 20% of excess over $300,000 |
| 350,001 -- 400,000 | $63,600 + 20% of excess over $300,000 |
| 400,001 -- 450,000 | $73,600 + 20% of excess over $400,000 |
| 450,001 -- 500,000 | $83,600 + 20% of excess over $450,000 |
| 500,001 -- 1,000,000 | $93,600 + 20% of excess over $500,000 |
| 1,000,001+ | $193,600 + 20% of excess over $1,000,000 |

- **Top income-tax marginal rate** — The top income-tax marginal rate is 20%. Above $270,000, SRT (Section 4) and ECAL (Section 5) stack on top.  _(FRCS Tax Rates)_

Bracket discrepancy note: A secondary FRCS public-notice summary ("New PAYE Structure") describes the bands above $270,000 with combined rates like 33%/39% — these reflect the combined PAYE + SRT marginal rate after SRT was integrated into PAYE for administration. The FRCS Tax Rates page shows the components separately (20% income tax + the SRT schedule). This skill treats income tax (20% cap) and SRT as separate stacked components per the Tax Rates page. The combined effective top marginal rate is ~44% (20% + 24%) on income over $1M.

### 3.2 Computation Method

- **PAYE computation method** — Annual income tax = bracket base + (rate × (chargeable income − bracket floor)) Period PAYE        = annual income tax ÷ number of pay periods (cumulatively adjusted)  _(FRCS)_
- **Tax-free threshold as personal allowance** — PAYE is computed on annualised chargeable income, divided across pay periods, and trued up cumulatively over the year via the FRCS PAYE formula. The $30,000 tax-free threshold IS the personal allowance — there is no separate allowance.  _(FRCS)_

## Section 4 -- Social Responsibility Tax (SRT) -- High Earners Only

- **SRT applicability** — SRT applies only to chargeable income above $270,000 and is collected through PAYE for employees [FRCS Tax Rates -- https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/].  _(FRCS Tax Rates -- https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/)_

**SRT bracket table**  _(FRCS Tax Rates -- https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/)_

| Chargeable income (FJD) | SRT |
| --- | --- |
| 0 -- 270,000 | Nil |
| 270,001 -- 300,000 | 18% of excess over $270,000 |
| 300,001 -- 350,000 | $5,400 + 19% of excess over $300,000 |
| 350,001 -- 400,000 | $14,900 + 20% of excess over $350,000 |
| 400,001 -- 450,000 | $24,900 + 21% of excess over $400,000 |
| 450,001 -- 500,000 | $35,400 + 22% of excess over $450,000 |
| 500,001 -- 1,000,000 | $46,400 + 23% of excess over $500,000 |
| 1,000,001+ | $161,400 + 24% of excess over $1,000,000 |

## Section 5 -- Environment & Climate Adaptation Levy (ECAL) on Income

- **ECAL rate on income** — 10% on chargeable income exceeding $270,000 — the same high-earner band as SRT, in addition to income tax and SRT. Collected via PAYE for employees.  _(HLB Fiji -- https://www.hlbfiji.com/an-introduction-to-environmental-climate-and-adaptation-levy-ecal/)_
- **ECAL on income formula** — ECAL on income = 10% × (chargeable income − $270,000), where chargeable income > $270,000  _(HLB Fiji -- https://www.hlbfiji.com/an-introduction-to-environmental-climate-and-adaptation-levy-ecal/)_

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] The primary FRCS ECAL page returned a 404 during research. The 10%-above-$270,000 figure is corroborated by HLB Fiji and multiple secondary sources but was not timestamped against the live FRCS page for 2025. Confirm before publishing as definitive.

Note: ECAL also separately applies as 10% on prescribed-service businesses and certain luxury items — these are not payroll-relevant and are out of scope here.

## Section 6 -- Non-Resident Employees

**Non-resident rules table**

| Rule | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE rate | Flat **20% from the first dollar** of chargeable income — NO $30,000 tax-free threshold | FRCS personal income tax materials |

## Section 12 -- Worked Examples

All figures in FJD. PAYE per Section 3.1; FNPF per Section 7.1 (employee 8%, employer 10%). Examples assume employment income only and full-year employment unless stated.

### Example 1 -- Resident below the tax-free threshold ($20,000/yr)

**Input:** Resident, annual gross ordinary wages $20,000.

```
PAYE: $20,000 < $30,000 threshold              = $0
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 20,000              = $1,600.00
Total employee deductions                       = $1,600.00
Net pay                                          = 20,000 − 1,600 = $18,400.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 20,000             = $2,000.00
Total employer cost                              = 20,000 + 2,000 = $22,000.00
```

### Example 2 -- Resident in the 18% band ($45,000/yr)

**Input:** Resident, annual gross $45,000. Monthly pay.

```
PAYE: 18% × (45,000 − 30,000) = 0.18 × 15,000  = $2,700.00
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 45,000              = $3,600.00
Total employee deductions                       = 2,700 + 3,600 = $6,300.00
Net pay (annual)                                = 45,000 − 6,300 = $38,700.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 45,000             = $4,500.00
─ Monthly view ─
Gross 45,000/12                                 = $3,750.00
PAYE 2,700/12                                   = $225.00
FNPF 3,600/12                                   = $300.00
Net monthly = 3,750 − 225 − 300                 = $3,225.00
```

### Example 3 -- Resident in the 20% band ($80,000/yr)

**Input:** Resident, annual gross $80,000.

```
PAYE: 3,600 + 20% × (80,000 − 50,000)
     = 3,600 + 0.20 × 30,000 = 3,600 + 6,000   = $9,600.00
SRT / ECAL: income < $270,000                   = $0
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 80,000              = $6,400.00
Total employee deductions                       = 9,600 + 6,400 = $16,000.00
Net pay                                          = 80,000 − 16,000 = $64,000.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 80,000             = $8,000.00
```

### Example 4 -- High earner with SRT + ECAL ($320,000/yr)

**Input:** Resident, annual chargeable income $320,000.

```
Income tax (PAYE): 53,600 + 20% × (320,000 − 300,000)
     = 53,600 + 0.20 × 20,000 = 53,600 + 4,000  = $57,600.00
SRT: 5,400 + 19% × (320,000 − 300,000)
     = 5,400 + 0.19 × 20,000 = 5,400 + 3,800     = $9,200.00
ECAL (on income): 10% × (320,000 − 270,000)
     = 0.10 × 50,000                              = $5,000.00   [RESEARCH GAP — confirm ECAL]
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 320,000              = $25,600.00
Total employee deductions
     = 57,600 + 9,200 + 5,000 + 25,600           = $97,400.00
Net pay = 320,000 − 97,400                       = $222,600.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 320,000             = $32,000.00
```

### Example 5 -- Non-resident employee ($60,000/yr)

**Input:** Non-resident, annual gross $60,000. No tax-free threshold (Section 6).

```
PAYE: flat 20% × 60,000                          = $12,000.00
SRT / ECAL: income < $270,000                    = $0
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 60,000               = $4,800.00   [RESEARCH GAP — confirm FNPF coverage for non-residents]
Total employee deductions                        = 12,000 + 4,800 = $16,800.00
Net pay = 60,000 − 16,800                        = $43,200.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 60,000              = $6,000.00
```

### Example 6 -- Minimum-wage worker ($5.00/hr, 40 hrs/wk)

**Input:** Resident, $5.00/hr × 40 hrs × 52 weeks = $10,400/yr.

```
Annual gross: 5.00 × 40 × 52                     = $10,400.00
PAYE: $10,400 < $30,000 threshold                = $0
FNPF (employee 8%): 0.08 × 10,400               = $832.00
Net pay = 10,400 − 832                           = $9,568.00
Employer FNPF (10%): 0.10 × 10,400              = $1,040.00
```

## Section 13 -- Tier 1 Rules (Deterministic -- Apply Mechanically)

- **Tax-free threshold residents only** — Tax-free threshold $30,000 applies to residents ONLY. Non-residents pay flat 20% from $1.  _(FRCS)_

- **ECAL applies only above $270,000** — ECAL on income applies ONLY above $270,000 — zero below.  _(HLB Fiji; RESEARCH GAP)_
- **FNPF rate composition** — FNPF = 8% employee + 10% employer, no cap, on ordinary wages.  _(FNPF, eff. 1 Jan 2024)_
- **PAYE is final tax** — PAYE is a final tax for employment-only income — no annual return for those employees.  _(FRCS)_
- **Tax year definition** — Tax year = calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec).  _(FRCS)_
- **Employer withholding responsibility** — All employee deductions (PAYE/SRT/ECAL + 8% FNPF) are withheld and remitted by the employer.
- **Annualisation requirement** — Annualise before applying brackets, then allocate to pay periods cumulatively.

## Section 14 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

**Tier 2 Catalogue table**

| Issue | Why it needs judgement |
| --- | --- |
| Income at/near $270,000 | Triggers SRT + ECAL stacking; combined marginal rate jumps materially |
| "Ordinary wages" definition for FNPF | Whether allowances/bonuses/overtime are inside the FNPF base affects the 18% total |
| Non-resident FNPF coverage | Applicability to short-term assignees is unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Mid-year start/leave | Cumulative PAYE true-up; annualisation assumptions break |
| Sector Wages Regulation Order | Sector minimum may exceed national $5.00/hr |
| Voluntary FNPF top-ups | Tax treatment and employer-policy interaction |
| Fringe benefits / non-cash pay | Out of scope — fringe benefit tax rules apply (escalate) |
| Penalty exposure | Exact FRCS/FNPF penalty figures unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP] |

## Section 15 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested columns for a per-employee monthly payroll working paper:

**Excel Working Paper Template columns**

| Column | Content |
| --- | --- |
| A | Employee name |
| B | TIN |
| C | FNPF member number |
| D | Residency (R / NR) |
| E | Pay period |
| F | Gross ordinary wages (period) |
| G | Annualised gross (=F × periods/year) |
| H | Annual income tax (PAYE) per Section 3.1 / Section 6 |
| I | SRT (annual) per Section 4 (0 if ≤ $270,000) |
| J | ECAL on income (annual) per Section 5 (0 if ≤ $270,000) |
| K | Period PAYE+SRT+ECAL (=(H+I+J)/periods) |
| L | FNPF employee (=F × 8%) |
| M | Net pay (=F − K − L) |
| N | FNPF employer (=F × 10%) |
| O | Total employer cost (=F + N) |

**Control totals (must reconcile):**
- Sum of column K = PAYE/SRT/ECAL remitted to FRCS for the period.
- Sum of (L + N) = total FNPF remitted (employee 8% + employer 10% = 18%).
- Sum of column M = total net salary disbursed.

## Section 16 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

**Terminology Reading Guide table**

| Term / abbreviation | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| FRCS | Fiji Revenue & Customs Service (income tax authority) |
| FNPF | Fiji National Provident Fund (mandatory pension/social fund) |
| PAYE | Pay As You Earn — employment income tax withholding |
| SRT | Social Responsibility Tax (high earners, > $270,000) |
| ECAL | Environment & Climate Adaptation Levy |
| TPOS | Taxpayer Online Services (FRCS filing portal) |
| TIN | Tax Identification Number |
| WRO | Wages Regulation Order (sector minimum wage instrument) |
| MEPIR | Ministry of Employment, Productivity & Industrial Relations |
| Ordinary wages | Base wages used for FNPF contribution calculation |
| $ / FJD | Fijian Dollar (the only currency in this skill) |

## Section 17 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the minimum viable inputs (Section 2) are not available:

1. Ask for **residency status** first — it changes the entire PAYE computation.
2. Ask for **annual or period gross ordinary wages** and **pay frequency**.
3. Confirm **FNPF membership / age 15+**.
4. If the employee may earn **> $270,000**, STOP and escalate (SRT + ECAL stacking).
5. If sector-specific (construction, hospitality, etc.), check for a **Wages Regulation Order** before assuming the national minimum wage.
6. Produce an **estimated** computation clearly labelled as draft, and route to a Fiji-licensed accountant for sign-off.

### Test Suite (recompute to the cent before relying on this skill)

1. **Resident $20,000:** PAYE $0; FNPF employee $1,600; net $18,400; employer FNPF $2,000. ✓
2. **Resident $45,000:** PAYE $2,700 (18% × 15,000); FNPF employee $3,600; net $38,700; employer FNPF $4,500. ✓
3. **Resident $80,000:** PAYE $9,600 (3,600 + 20% × 30,000); FNPF employee $6,400; net $64,000; employer FNPF $8,000. ✓
4. **Resident $320,000:** PAYE $57,600; SRT $9,200; ECAL $5,000; FNPF employee $25,600; total deductions $97,400; net $222,600; employer FNPF $32,000. ✓
5. **Non-resident $60,000:** PAYE $12,000 (flat 20%); FNPF employee $4,800; net $43,200; employer FNPF $6,000. ✓
6. **Minimum wage 40 hrs/wk:** annual $10,400; PAYE $0; FNPF employee $832; net $9,568; employer FNPF $1,040. ✓
7. **FNPF total check:** employee 8% + employer 10% = 18% on ordinary wages, no cap. ✓
8. **SRT/ECAL boundary:** chargeable income of exactly $270,000 → SRT $0 and ECAL $0 (both apply only to the *excess over* $270,000). ✓
9. **Bracket continuity:** income tax at $50,000 = $3,600; at $270,000 = $47,600; at $300,000 = $53,600; at $1,000,000 = $193,600. ✓

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the $30,000 tax-free threshold to a non-resident — non-residents pay flat 20% from the first dollar.
- NEVER apply an income-tax marginal rate above 20% — additional burden above $270,000 comes from SRT and ECAL, not income tax.
- NEVER charge SRT or ECAL on income at or below $270,000.
- NEVER cap or floor FNPF — it is 8% employee + 10% employer on full ordinary wages with no ceiling.
- NEVER omit the employer's 10% FNPF when computing total employer cost.
- NEVER treat PAYE as non-final for an employment-only employee, nor force them to file an annual return.
- NEVER state exact FRCS or FNPF penalty figures — they are unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP]; cite the governing Act and escalate.
- NEVER present ECAL figures as definitive without flagging the [RESEARCH GAP] on the FRCS ECAL source.
- NEVER assume the national minimum wage applies where a sector Wages Regulation Order may set a higher rate.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Fiji-licensed accountant.
