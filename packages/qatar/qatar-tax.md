Note: no VAT patterns needed -- Qatar has no VAT system.

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Client asks about Qatar VAT

"Does Qatar have VAT?" -- No. Qatar has not implemented VAT. No VAT return, registration, or collection required.

### Example 2 -- Purchase from UAE supplier

Qatar company buys goods from UAE. UAE supplier charges 5% UAE VAT. The UAE VAT is an irrecoverable cost to the Qatar company. No mechanism to recover it in Qatar.

## Section 5 -- Classification rules

### 5.1 No VAT

- **No VAT** — No VAT registration, returns, invoicing, reverse charge, or input recovery exists in Qatar.

### 5.2 Corporate income tax

- **Corporate income tax rate** — 10% percent (flat on non-Qatari-owned share of profits)
- **Qatari/GCC-owned share exemption** — Qatari/GCC-owned share exempt.
- **Oil/gas corporate tax rate** — up to 35% percent

### 5.3 Excise tax

- **Tobacco excise rate** — 100% percent
- **Energy drinks excise rate** — 100% percent
- **Carbonated drinks excise rate** — 50% percent
- **Special purpose goods excise rate** — 100% percent
- **Excise filing frequency** — Monthly return to GTA.

### 5.4 Customs duties

- **Standard customs duty** — 5% percent (CIF)
- **GCC-origin goods** — GCC-origin goods exempt.
- **Free zones** — Free zones may exempt.

## Section 6 -- No VAT return form

- **No VAT return / CIT filing deadline** — No VAT return exists. CIT return filed within 4 months of fiscal year end.

## Section 7 -- No reverse charge

- **No reverse charge** — No VAT system means no reverse charge mechanism.

## Section 8 -- No input deductibility

- **No input deductibility** — No input VAT recovery mechanism. Foreign VAT paid (e.g., UAE 5%, Saudi 15%) is irrecoverable cost.

## Section 9 -- Cross-border implications

Qatar businesses bear irrecoverable foreign VAT from GCC implementing states. No mechanism to recover. Non-implementing states (Qatar, Kuwait) treated as non-GCC by implementing states.

When VAT arrives: include change-of-law clauses in long-term contracts.

## Section 10 -- Edge cases, test suite, and escalation

### Edge cases

No. Issue invoices without VAT.

Irrecoverable cost.

No Qatar VAT. Saudi customer accounts for import VAT under Saudi rules.

No VAT group possible in Qatar.

Prudent to include VAT change-of-law clause.

No Qatar VAT on digital services.

- **EC7 -- Withholding tax.** — 5% WHT on payments to non-residents for services in Qatar. This is CIT, NOT VAT.

Energy drink tax is excise, NOT VAT.

CIT exemptions for up to 20 years. No VAT. Excise still applies.

### Test suite

QAR 50,000 consulting. Expected: no VAT. Invoice without VAT line.

AED 10,000 + AED 500 UAE VAT. Expected: total cost AED 10,500. UAE VAT irrecoverable.

QAR 100,000. Expected: no Qatar VAT. Oman handles import VAT.

UK consultant QAR 30,000 services in Qatar. Expected: 5% WHT = QAR 1,500. This is CIT, not VAT.

1,000 cases energy drinks CIF QAR 20,000. Expected: excise QAR 20,000 (100%), customs QAR 1,000 (5%).
