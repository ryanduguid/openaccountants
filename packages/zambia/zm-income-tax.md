## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |

| Country | Zambia (Republic of Zambia) |
| Tax | Income Tax (PAYE for employees; income/turnover/presumptive tax for self-employed) |
| Currency | Zambian Kwacha (ZMW / K) only |
| Tax year (charge year) | Calendar year (1 January -- 31 December) |
| Primary authority | Zambia Revenue Authority (ZRA) |

| Validation date | Pending |
| Skill version | 0.1 |

**Important year note:** The PAYE bands below are identical for the 2025 and 2026 charge years (PwC's 2026 charge-year page shows the same figures, introduced effective 1 Jan 2025). NAPSA, NHIMA, and minimum-wage figures are the 2025 values; where 2026 figures were not officially confirmed they carry a [RESEARCH GAP] marker.

### PAYE Bands (2025, unchanged into 2026)

**PAYE Bands (2025, unchanged into 2026)**  _(PwC, ZM individual -- taxes on personal income)_

| Annual taxable income (ZMW) | Monthly equivalent (ZMW) | Rate | Cumulative tax at band top (annual) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 61,200 | 0 -- 5,100 | 0% | K0 |
| 61,201 -- 85,200 | 5,101 -- 7,100 | 20% | K4,800 |
| 85,201 -- 110,400 | 7,101 -- 9,200 | 30% | K12,360 |
| Over 110,400 | Over 9,200 | 37% | -- |

- **PAYE band progressivity** — Progressive. Only income within each band is taxed at that band's rate. Residents and non-residents are charged the same income-tax rates in principle, though most non-resident income is instead subject to withholding tax.  _(PwC, ZM individual -- taxes on personal income)_
- **Tax-free threshold** — ZMW 5,100/month (K61,200/year)  _(PwC, ZM individual -- taxes on personal income; ZRA PAYE leaflet, Pay-As-You-Earn.pdf)_

**Cumulative tax arithmetic (annual):**
- Band 2 width K24,000 × 20% = K4,800 → cumulative K4,800 at K85,200
- Band 3 width K25,200 × 30% = K7,560 → cumulative K4,800 + K7,560 = K12,360 at K110,400

**Cumulative tax arithmetic (monthly):**
- Band 2 width K2,000 × 20% = K400 → cumulative K400 at K7,100
- Band 3 width K2,100 × 30% = K630 → cumulative K400 + K630 = K1,030 at K9,200

### NAPSA -- Pension Contributions (2025)

**NAPSA -- Pension Contributions (2025)**  _(NAPSA official; PwC ZM individual -- other issues)_

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total contribution rate | 10% of gross monthly earnings | NAPSA official; PwC ZM individual -- other issues |
| Employee share | 5% | NAPSA official |
| Employer share | 5% | NAPSA official |
| Monthly insurable-earnings ceiling | ZMW 34,164.00 | NAPSA 2025 announcement |
| Max monthly contribution per party | ZMW 1,708.20 | NAPSA (34,164 × 5%) |
| Max combined monthly contribution | ZMW 3,416.40 | NAPSA (1,708.20 × 2) |
| National Average Earnings (NAE) 2025 | ZMW 8,541.00 | NAPSA 2025 announcement |

**Component check:** employee 5% + employer 5% = 10% total. Per-party cap 1,708.20 + 1,708.20 = 3,416.40 combined.
**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** 2026 NAPSA ceiling and NAE — not officially confirmed; do not assume the 2025 ceiling carries into 2026.

### NHIMA -- National Health Insurance (2025)

**NHIMA -- National Health Insurance (2025)**  _(NHIMA (secondary); workforceafrica payroll guide)_

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Total rate | 1% of gross earnings | NHIMA (secondary); workforceafrica payroll guide |
| Employee share | 0.5% | NHIMA (secondary) |
| Employer share | 0.5% | NHIMA (secondary) |
| Monthly returns due | by the 10th | NHIMA (secondary) |

**Component check:** employee 0.5% + employer 0.5% = 1% total.
**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The 1% total / 0.5%+0.5% split is widely reported but the official NHIMA rate schedule could not be retrieved directly. Re-verify against the NHIMA Act/SI before publishing as authoritative.

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown whether earner is employee or self-employed | STOP -- do not compute without status |
| Unknown gross vs net of allowances | Treat the figure as gross monthly earnings |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category (self-employed) | Not deductible |
| Unknown whether NAPSA ceiling applies | Apply the K34,164 ceiling |
| Unknown turnover-tax vs income-tax election | Turnover tax if turnover ≤ K5,000,000 (see R-ZM-2) |
| Unknown VAT registration | Not VAT-registered (use gross amounts) |
| Charge year not stated | Current charge year (2025/2026 bands are identical) |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable (employee/PAYE):** gross monthly earnings (basic + allowances), and confirmation the person is an employee. Optionally: confirmation of NAPSA/NHIMA applicability.

**Minimum viable (self-employed):** bank statement for the charge year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus the nature of the business and approximate annual turnover (to decide turnover tax vs income tax).

**Recommended:** payslips, NAPSA/NHIMA contribution records, sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, prior-year ZRA assessment, VAT registration status.

**Ideal:** complete income and expenditure account, asset register, provisional-tax payment confirmations, employment contract / minimum-wage order applicable to the sector.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No earnings figure (employee) or no bank statement (self-employed) = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported and that the wholly-and-exclusively test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-ZM-1** — Employment status unknown. "PAYE (employee) and turnover/income tax (self-employed) are entirely different regimes. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the person's status. Please confirm before proceeding."  _(R-ZM-1)_
- **R-ZM-2** — Turnover near or above K5,000,000. "Turnover tax applies only to annual turnover up to ZMW 5,000,000 (PwC, ZM other taxes). Above this the business files under the standard income-tax regime, and VAT registration may be required. Escalate to a ZICA-qualified accountant."  _(R-ZM-2; PwC, ZM other taxes)_
- **R-ZM-3** — Companies, partnerships, group structures. "This skill covers individuals -- employees and sole traders only. Companies and partnerships file separate returns under different rules. Escalate to a ZICA-qualified accountant."  _(R-ZM-3)_
- **R-ZM-4** — Mining, farming, or special-sector income. "Mining and certain sector incomes are excluded from turnover tax and have bespoke regimes. Out of scope. Escalate to a ZICA-qualified accountant."  _(R-ZM-4)_
- **R-ZM-5** — Non-resident / withholding-tax matters. "Most non-resident income is taxed via withholding tax, not the PAYE/income-tax bands. Out of scope. Escalate to a ZICA-qualified accountant."  _(R-ZM-5)_
- **R-ZM-6** — Arrears / ZRA enforcement. "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to ZRA enforcement. Late-payment penalties (5% plus BoZ discount rate + 2% interest) compound. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."  _(R-ZM-6)_
- **R-ZM-7** — VAT return requested. "This skill covers income tax / PAYE / turnover tax only. For Zambia VAT, use the zambia-vat skill (if available) or escalate."  _(R-ZM-7)_

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules. Amounts are in ZMW (K). Mobile-money references (MTN MoMo, Airtel Money, Zamtel Kwacha) are common in Zambian statements.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All examples use the 2025 bands (identical for 2026). PAYE is computed on monthly gross taxable earnings.

### Example 1 -- Mid-range salary (K8,000/month employee)

**Input line:**
`31/03/2025 ; ZANACO ; EMPLOYER ACME LTD ; SALARY MAR ; +8,000.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
Employee. PAYE on K8,000 monthly:
- Up to K7,100 cumulative = K400
- Excess K8,000 − K7,100 = K900 × 30% = K270
- PAYE = K400 + K270 = **K670**
NAPSA employee 5% × K8,000 = K400 (under K1,708.20 cap). NHIMA employee 0.5% × K8,000 = K40.
Net pay = 8,000 − 670 − 400 − 40 = **K6,890**.

**Classification:** PAYE K670; NAPSA (ee) K400; NHIMA (ee) K40; net K6,890.

### Example 2 -- Higher salary above NAPSA ceiling (K40,000/month)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; STANBIC ; EMPLOYER GLOBE LTD ; SALARY APR ; +40,000.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
PAYE on K40,000:
- Up to K9,200 cumulative = K1,030
- Excess K40,000 − K9,200 = K30,800 × 37% = K11,396
- PAYE = K1,030 + K11,396 = **K12,426**
NAPSA employee capped: 5% × K34,164 ceiling = **K1,708.20** (gross exceeds ceiling). NHIMA employee 0.5% × K40,000 = K200.
Net pay = 40,000 − 12,426 − 1,708.20 − 200 = **K25,665.80**.

**Classification:** PAYE K12,426; NAPSA (ee) K1,708.20; NHIMA (ee) K200; net K25,665.80.

### Example 3 -- Below tax-free threshold (K4,500/month)

**Input line:**
`31/05/2025 ; FNB ; EMPLOYER SHOP CO ; WAGES MAY ; +4,500.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
K4,500 is below the K5,100 monthly tax-free threshold. PAYE = **K0**.
NAPSA employee 5% × K4,500 = K225. NHIMA employee 0.5% × K4,500 = K22.50.
Net pay = 4,500 − 0 − 225 − 22.50 = **K4,252.50**.

**Classification:** PAYE K0; NAPSA (ee) K225; NHIMA (ee) K22.50; net K4,252.50.

### Example 4 -- Turnover-tax sole trader (mobile-money receipts)

**Input line:**
`12/06/2025 ; MTN MOMO ; RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMER ; SALE ; +3,000.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
Sole trader with annual turnover under K5,000,000, taxed under turnover tax. Turnover tax is **5% on turnover above K12,000/year; 0% on the first K12,000** (PwC, ZM other taxes). No expense deductions. If monthly turnover is K3,000 (K36,000/year), tax = (36,000 − 12,000) × 5% = K24,000 × 5% = **K1,200/year** (≈ K100/month once the annual K12,000 is exhausted). Returns due by the 14th of the following month.

**Classification:** Turnover base K3,000 (this receipt); no deductions; 5% applies above the K12,000 annual exemption.

### Example 5 -- Non-deductible entertainment (income-tax trader)

**Input line:**
`22/04/2025 ; ABSA CARD ; CHRISMA RESTAURANT ; CLIENT DINNER ; -850.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
Client entertainment is private/entertainment in nature and not wholly and exclusively for the production of income. Not deductible. No apportionment.

**Classification:** NOT deductible. Exclude from expenses.

### Example 6 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; ZANACO ; OWN ACCOUNT - SAVINGS ; ; -5,000.00 ; ZMW`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Wholly and Exclusively Test (income-tax taxpayers)

- **Wholly and exclusively test** — An expense is deductible only if incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis. (General Zambian income-tax principle; verify exact section against the Income Tax Act before publishing — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm statutory section].)  _(General Zambian income-tax principle [RESEARCH GAP])_

### 5.2 PAYE Computation (employees)

- **PAYE monthly band application** — Apply the progressive monthly bands (Section 1) to gross monthly taxable earnings: - 0 – K5,100: 0% - K5,101 – K7,100: 20% (cumulative K400 at top) - K7,101 – K9,200: 30% (cumulative K1,030 at top) - Over K9,200: 37% Employer deducts PAYE monthly and remits to ZRA by the 10th of the following month.  _(ZRA payment due dates)_

### 5.3 NAPSA (social security)

- **NAPSA contribution rule** — 10% total = 5% employee + 5% employer, on gross monthly earnings, capped at the K34,164 monthly insurable-earnings ceiling (max K1,708.20 per party). The earnings base includes basic salary, bonuses, commissions, severance, overtime, leave allowance, and acting allowance.  _(NAPSA 2025 announcement)_

### 5.4 NHIMA (health insurance)

- **NHIMA contribution rule** — 1% total = 0.5% employee + 0.5% employer, on gross earnings (basic plus all allowances/overtime/bonuses). Compulsory for all workers including casual, temporary, and contract. Monthly returns due by the 10th.  _(NHIMA — secondary sources; [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the NHIMA Act/SI])_

### 5.5 Self-Employed Regimes

**Self-Employed Regimes**  _(PwC, ZM other taxes; PKF Zambia 2025 Tax Alert; PwC, ZM individual)_

| Regime | Scope | Rate | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turnover tax | Annual turnover ≤ K5,000,000 (excludes interest, dividends, royalties, consultancy, standard mining) | 0% on first K12,000; 5% above K12,000 | PwC, ZM other taxes; PKF Zambia 2025 Tax Alert |
| Rental income tax | Rental turnover | 0% ≤ K30,000; 4% K30,000–800,000; 16% > K800,000 | PwC, ZM other taxes |
| Presumptive (passenger transport) | Per vehicle, annual | See table below | PwC, ZM other taxes |
| Standard income tax | Turnover > K5,000,000 or excluded income | PAYE bands applied to taxable profit | PwC, ZM individual |

- **Turnover tax filing** — Turnover tax taxpayers pay 5% on turnover above K12,000/year and do NOT deduct expenses. Returns and payment due by the 14th of the following month.  _(PwC, ZM other taxes)_

**Presumptive tax — passenger transport (annual, per vehicle)**  _(PwC, ZM other taxes)_

| Vehicle seating | Annual presumptive tax (ZMW) |
| --- | --- |
| 36–49 seater | 10,368 |
| 22–35 seater | 7,776 |
| 18–21 seater | 5,184 |
| 12–17 seater | 2,592 |
| Below 12 seater (incl. taxis) | 1,296 |

### 5.6 Provisional (Advance) Income Tax — non-employment income

- **Provisional tax filing rule** — Individuals earning over K61,200/year from non-employment sources file quarterly provisional returns. Quarter deadlines: 31 Mar, 30 Jun, 30 Sep, 31 Dec (manual Q1 submission 5 Mar). New registrants after 31 Mar: within 90 days of registration.  _(PwC, ZM individual — tax administration)_

### 5.7 VAT Interaction (self-employed crossing the threshold)

**VAT Interaction**  _(PwC, ZM other taxes; ZRA tax information)_

| Item | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard VAT rate | 16% | PwC, ZM other taxes; ZRA tax information |
| Registration threshold | Annual turnover > K800,000 (or > K200,000 in any consecutive 3-month period) | ZRA tax information; PwC |
| VAT returns | Monthly, due by the 18th (e-filing) | ZRA tax information |

- **K800,000 threshold note** — Note: the K800,000 threshold no longer governs turnover-tax eligibility (now K5m) but still governs VAT registration.  _(ZRA tax information; PwC)_

### 5.8 Non-Deductible Expenses (income-tax taxpayers)

**Non-Deductible Expenses**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment (client meals, events) | Not wholly and exclusively for production of income |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax / PAYE itself | Tax on income |
| Capital expenditure | Relieved via capital allowances, not as expense [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Zambian wear-and-tear rates] |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction (income-tax traders)

- **Home office deduction rule** — - Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room as a percentage of total rooms or floor area) - Apply that percentage to: rent, ZESCO electricity, water, internet, maintenance - Must be a dedicated workspace; a dual-use room does NOT qualify **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the arrangement. **Flag for reviewer:** confirm room count / floor-area basis and that the workspace is genuinely dedicated.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- **Motor vehicle business use rule** — - Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and capital allowances is deductible - Client must maintain a mileage log (business trips vs total) **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a mileage log is provided. **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the business percentage is documented and reasonable, and the applicable wear-and-tear rate. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Zambian capital-allowance rates.]

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- **Phone/internet mixed use rule** — - Business-use portion only (MTN/Airtel/Zamtel airtime and data) **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Turnover-Tax vs Income-Tax Election

- **Election rule** — - Turnover tax (5%, no deductions) suits low-expense businesses; the standard income-tax regime suits high-expense businesses - The election interacts with the K5,000,000 turnover ceiling and excluded-income rules **Flag for reviewer:** confirm which regime minimises tax and is correctly registered with ZRA.

### 6.5 Rental Income Banding

- **Rental income banding rule** — - Rental turnover is taxed on its own scale (0% / 4% / 16%); confirm gross rental turnover and that no expenses are netted off before applying the rate **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the rental turnover figure and band.

### 6.6 Bad Debt Write-Off (income-tax traders)

- **Bad debt write-off rule** — - Deductible only if the income was previously declared, all reasonable recovery steps were taken, and the debt is genuinely irrecoverable **Flag for reviewer** to confirm all three conditions.

### Test Suite

Input: Employee, gross K4,500/month.
Expected: PAYE K0; NAPSA (ee) K225; NHIMA (ee) K22.50; net K4,252.50.

Input: Employee, gross K8,000/month.
Expected: PAYE K670 (K400 + K900×30%); NAPSA (ee) K400; NHIMA (ee) K40; net K6,890.

Input: Employee, gross K40,000/month.
Expected: PAYE K12,426 (K1,030 + K30,800×37%); NAPSA (ee) capped K1,708.20; NHIMA (ee) K200; net K25,665.80.

Input: Employee, gross K34,164/month.
Expected: NAPSA (ee) = K34,164 × 5% = K1,708.20 (exactly the cap). PAYE = K1,030 + (34,164 − 9,200)×37% = K1,030 + K9,236.68 = K10,266.68.

Input: Self-employed (standard regime), taxable profit K150,000/year.
Expected: Income tax = K12,360 + (150,000 − 110,400)×37% = K12,360 + K14,652 = K27,012.

Input: Sole trader, annual turnover K200,000 (no excluded income), under K5m ceiling.
Expected: Turnover tax = (200,000 − 12,000) × 5% = K188,000 × 5% = K9,400/year.

Input: Gross annual rent K500,000.
Expected: Rental income tax at 4% (band K30,000–800,000) = K500,000 × 4% = K20,000. [Confirm whether the first K30,000 is 0% before applying — PwC bands as stated; reviewer to confirm marginal vs flat application.]

Input: K850 client dinner claimed as expense (income-tax trader).
Expected: Remove — not deductible.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply turnover tax to interest, dividends, royalties, consultancy, or standard mining income

- NEVER treat NAPSA or NHIMA as a trading expense of the individual
- NEVER allow entertainment, personal, or fine/penalty expenses as deductions
- NEVER allow income tax / PAYE itself as a deduction
- NEVER assume the 2025 NAPSA ceiling, NHIMA split, or minimum wage carries into 2026 without confirmation
- NEVER treat a [RESEARCH GAP] figure as confirmed — flag it for the reviewer
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated and pending professional review
