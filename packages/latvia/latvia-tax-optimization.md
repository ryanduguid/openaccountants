# Latvia Tax Optimization

## Latvia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: VID (State Revenue Service), Finanšu ministrija, PwC/KPMG Latvia. Figures must agree with `latvia-income-tax.md` / `latvia-social-contributions.md` / `latvia-payroll.md`. NOT yet signed off by a Latvian tax adviser. Aggressive positions are never advised; every suggestion must be reviewed.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Republic of Latvia |
| Currency | EUR |
| Headline levers | Distributed-profits CIT (0% reinvested / 20% on distribution); micro-enterprise tax; FIK vs SIA |
| Corporate tax (SIA) | **0% on reinvested/retained profit; 20% only when distributed** (applied to a 0.8 base → effective 25% of the net amount distributed). (VID; Finanšu ministrija) |
| Micro-enterprise tax | **25% of turnover** (a single combined tax) for qualifying small businesses |
| Self-employed (FIK) | IIN at **25.5%** (progressive top) **or** micro-enterprise tax 25% |
| Anti-avoidance | Substance; deemed-distribution rules capture non-business spending |

> **The Latvian headline mirrors Estonia: an SIA company pays 0% on profit it RETAINS/REINVESTS, and 20% only when it distributes.** Reinvest, and you defer indefinitely.

## Section 2 -- Deferral via a Company (the core lever)

**Deferral via a Company (the core lever)**

| Action | Tax |
| --- | --- |
| SIA earns profit, **reinvests/retains** it | **0% CIT** |
| SIA **distributes** profit as dividends | 20% CIT on the distribution (gross-up: tax = 20% × profit/0.8 ⇒ ~25% of the net paid) |
| Non-business spending / deemed distributions | Taxed as if distributed — keep business/private clean |

For anyone reinvesting to grow (hiring, equipment, expansion), the SIA defers all corporate tax until cash is taken out. **This usually beats operating as a self-employed FIK** (taxed currently at up to 25.5%).

- **2026 alternative regime for SIAs with only individual shareholders** — Distributable profit is divided by 0.85 and taxed at 15% CIT, with 6% PIT withheld on the actual amount paid. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2026 alternative-regime mechanics and whether it beats the standard 20% route for the client.]  _([RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2026 alternative-regime mechanics and whether it beats the standard 20% route for the client.])_

## Section 3 -- Micro-Enterprise Tax (simplicity for the small)

- **Micro-enterprise tax coverage** — A single 25% of turnover tax covers CIT + PIT + (part of) social insurance for qualifying micro-enterprises.  _(PwC)_
- **Micro-enterprise limitations** — Simple and predictable; but no expense deduction and turnover caps + activity limits apply. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current turnover cap and eligibility.]  _([RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current turnover cap and eligibility.])_

Best for very small, low-expense activities; model against the FIK/SIA routes.

## Section 4 -- Self-Employed (FIK) vs Company (SIA)

**Self-Employed (FIK) vs Company (SIA)**

| Route | Treatment | Best when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **FIK** (self-employed) | IIN up to 25.5% currently on net income; mandatory social insurance | Small, want income now, simple |
| **Micro-enterprise** | 25% of turnover | Tiny, low expenses |
| **SIA** | 0% retained / 20% distributed; real-expense deduction; limited liability | Reinvesting, growing, higher margins |

## Section 5 -- Deductions & Reliefs

**Deductions & Reliefs**

| Item | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Differentiated non-taxable minimum / reliefs | Per `latvia-income-tax.md` — confirm the 2025/2026 non-taxable minimum and dependant allowances. |
| SIA business expenses | Deductible against profit; but private use → deemed distribution (taxed). |
| Pension (Pillar 3) & donations | Limited deductible allowances. |

## Section 6 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Deemed distributions** — Non-business expenses, excessive loans to shareholders, and non-arm's-length transactions are taxed as if distributed — you cannot extract value tax-free by mislabelling it.
- **Substance requirement** — The SIA must carry on genuine business.
- **Micro-enterprise misuse** — Micro-enterprise regime must not be used to disguise what is really employment or a larger business split into pieces. AUDIT FLASH POINT.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Prohibition 1** — NEVER describe the SIA 0%-retained system as tax-free — it is deferral; 20% applies on distribution.
- **Prohibition 2** — NEVER advise extracting company value as "expenses"/loans to dodge the distribution tax — that triggers deemed-distribution tax.
- **Prohibition 3** — NEVER present the micro-enterprise regime without its turnover cap and no-deduction trade-off.
- **Prohibition 4** — NEVER contradict the rates in `latvia-income-tax.md` / `latvia-social-contributions.md` / `latvia-payroll.md`.
- **Prohibition 5** — NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Latvian tax adviser.
