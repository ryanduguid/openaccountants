## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Utah starts from **federal taxable income** (Form 1040, Line 15) — NOT federal AGI. This means:
- The federal standard deduction or itemized deductions are already subtracted.
- The QBI deduction (§199A) is already subtracted.
- Self-employment income from Schedule C is included via AGI.

**Flow:**
1. Federal Form 1040 is completed (including Schedule C, SE, and all federal deductions).
2. Federal taxable income flows to Utah TC-40, Line 1.
3. Utah additions and subtractions are applied (Lines 2–8).
4. Utah income is multiplied by the flat rate (Line 9 × rate = Line 10).
5. Credits (taxpayer tax credit, others) are applied to reduce tax.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment tax deduction
The federal deduction for 50% of self-employment tax (Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 15) reduces federal AGI, which flows through to federal taxable income. Utah benefits from this automatically since it starts from federal taxable income.

### Retirement contributions
Contributions to SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or solo 401(k) that reduce federal AGI flow through automatically. Utah does not add back these deductions.

### Health insurance deduction
The self-employed health insurance deduction (Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 17) reduces federal AGI and flows through to Utah automatically.

### Home office deduction
The home office deduction reduces Schedule C net profit, which reduces federal AGI. No separate Utah adjustment needed.

### Utah-specific: no SE tax at state level
Utah does not impose a separate self-employment tax. The only state-level obligation is income tax at the flat rate on Utah taxable income.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**[T1-UT-1] Tax computation.** Multiply Utah state taxable income (TC-40, Line 9) by the applicable flat rate. For TY 2025: Line 9 × 0.045 = Line 10.

**[T1-UT-2] Starting point.** Begin with federal taxable income from Form 1040, Line 15. Enter on TC-40, Line 1.

**[T1-UT-3] Additions to income (TC-40, Line 2).** Common additions:
- State/municipal bond interest from non-Utah states (Utah-exempt bonds excluded)
- Lump-sum distributions taxed at federal level under 10-year averaging (rare)
- Certain adoption expenses previously deducted

**[T1-UT-4] Subtractions from income (TC-40, Lines 3–7).** Common subtractions:
- Utah state tax refund included in federal income (if itemized prior year)
- Railroad retirement benefits (Tier 1 and Tier 2)
- Social Security benefits (Utah exempts all Social Security — full subtraction of amount included in federal taxable income)
- Military pay exclusions
- Retirement income credit (age 65+ with retirement income, up to $450 credit)

**[T1-UT-5] Taxpayer tax credit.** This is Utah's equivalent of a personal exemption. The base credit amount is $966 per taxpayer (2025). For MFJ: $966 × 2 = $1,932. Additional $2,111 per qualifying dependent. The total credit phases out at 1.3% of MAGI exceeding the threshold.

**[T1-UT-6] Filing due date.** April 15 following the tax year (April 15, 2026 for TY 2025). Extension: October 15 (automatic with federal extension, but payment still due April 15).

**[T1-UT-7] Estimated tax payments.** Required if Utah tax liability after credits will exceed $1,000. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 (same as federal). Underpayment penalty applies if <90% of current year liability or <100% of prior year liability is paid by deadline.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**[T2-UT-1] Residency determination.** A domiciliary of Utah is a resident regardless of time spent outside the state. A non-domiciliary who spends 183+ days in Utah may be treated as a resident. Part-year residents apportion income to the Utah period. Freelancers who travel extensively should document days carefully.

**[T2-UT-2] Multi-state income apportionment.** If the taxpayer has income sourced to multiple states, Utah provides a credit for taxes paid to other states (TC-40A). The credit is limited to the lesser of: (a) tax actually paid to the other state, or (b) Utah tax on the income sourced to the other state.

**[T2-UT-3] Taxpayer tax credit phase-out computation.** For high-income filers, the taxpayer tax credit phases out entirely. The effective result is that Utah tax approaches a true flat tax on all taxable income for higher earners, while lower earners pay less due to the credit. Reviewer should verify phase-out math for edge cases.

**[T2-UT-4] Business vs. hobby determination.** Same federal §183 analysis applies. If the IRS recharacterizes Schedule C activity as a hobby, Utah follows that treatment.
