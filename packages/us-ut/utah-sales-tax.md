## Step 0: Client Onboarding Questions

Before proceeding with any Utah sales tax analysis, collect the following from the client: [T1]

**Client Onboarding Questions**

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Do you have an Utah sales tax registration / tax ID? | Determines whether registration is needed before filing. |
| 2 | What is your current filing frequency (monthly / quarterly / annually)? | Controls which return periods to prepare. |
| 3 | What is your nexus type -- physical presence, economic nexus, or both? | Determines registration obligations and applicable rules. |
| 4 | Are you a marketplace seller (selling through Amazon, Etsy, etc.)? | Marketplace facilitator may already be collecting on your behalf. |
| 5 | What types of products or services do you sell in Utah? | Drives taxability classification under Utah law. |
| 6 | Do you sell to exempt entities (government, nonprofits, resellers)? | Determines whether exemption certificates must be collected and retained. |
| 7 | Do you have locations, employees, or inventory in Utah? | Physical presence creates nexus independent of economic thresholds. |
| 8 | Do you sell into multiple Utah local jurisdictions? | Local tax rates vary; determines compliance complexity. |

**If the client cannot answer questions 1-4, STOP and gather this information before proceeding.** [T1]

## Step 1: Tax Rate Structure

### 1.1 State Sales Tax Rate

- **State sales tax rate** — 4.85% (Applies to retail sale of tangible personal property and certain services. [T1])  _(Utah Code §59-12-103)_

## Edge Case Registry

### EC1 -- Food Rate vs. Full Rate Classification [T2]

**Situation:** A grocery store sells prepared deli items, packaged snacks, and fresh produce. Different rates apply.

**Resolution:**
- Fresh produce: 3% food rate. [T1]
- Packaged snacks (chips, crackers, not candy): 3% food rate. [T1]
- Candy: full combined rate (not food rate). [T1]
- Prepared deli items (heated, with utensils): full combined rate. [T1]
- Soft drinks: full combined rate. [T1]
- **Flag for reviewer:** Item classification against SST food definitions determines the applicable rate. [T2]

### EC2 -- SaaS Taxability [T2]

**Situation:** A SaaS company from Oregon provides cloud software to Utah businesses. Is it taxable?

**Resolution:**
- Utah taxes SaaS at the full combined rate. [T1]
- The SaaS company must register if it meets the $100K or 200 transaction economic nexus threshold. [T1]
- Tax is based on the customer's location (destination-based for remote sales). [T1]
- **Flag for reviewer:** Utah is one of the states that clearly taxes SaaS. Verify current USTC guidance. [T2]

### EC3 -- Origin-Based vs. Destination-Based Sourcing [T2]

**Situation:** A Utah retailer with a store in Salt Lake City ships an order to a customer in Park City. Different combined rates may apply.

**Resolution:**
- For intrastate sales, Utah uses origin-based sourcing. The rate at the seller's location (SLC) applies. [T1]
- For interstate sales (out-of-state buyer), destination-based sourcing applies. [T1]
- **Flag for reviewer:** Utah's hybrid sourcing creates different rate applications depending on whether the sale is intrastate or interstate. Verify the buyer's location. [T2]

### EC4 -- Food Rate Uniformity [T1]

**Situation:** A retailer asks whether the 3% food rate varies by location in Utah.

**Resolution:**
- The 3% food rate is uniform statewide regardless of the local combined rate on general merchandise. [T1]
- A store in a city with a 7.50% general rate and a store in a city with a 6.10% general rate both charge 3% on food. [T1]
- This simplifies POS configuration for food items. [T1]

### EC5 -- SaaS Company with Multi-State Customers [T2]

**Situation:** A SaaS company from Idaho (where SaaS is not taxable) sells subscriptions to Utah businesses.

**Resolution:**
- Utah taxes SaaS at the full combined rate. [T1]
- The company must register if economic nexus is met ($100K or 200 transactions). [T1]
- Destination-based sourcing applies for interstate sales. [T1]
- Tax based on the customer's Utah location. [T1]
- **Flag for reviewer:** SaaS companies should include Utah in their compliance matrix. Utah is one of the states that clearly taxes SaaS. [T2]

### EC6 -- Prepared Food at a Grocery Store [T2]

**Situation:** A grocery store has a deli that sells hot sandwiches, cold pre-made salads without utensils, and uncut birthday cakes.

**Resolution:**
- Hot sandwiches: prepared food (full rate). [T1]
- Cold pre-made salads without utensils and not heated: food (3% rate). [T1]
- Uncut birthday cakes (not heated, no utensils): food (3% rate). [T1]
- If the deli provides utensils with the salads, they become prepared food (full rate). [T2]
- **Flag for reviewer:** The prepared food determination depends on heating, utensils, and whether items are mixed for immediate consumption. [T2]

### EC7 -- Manufacturing Equipment Exemption [T1]

**Situation:** A manufacturer purchases a $500,000 production line for a Utah facility.

**Resolution:**
- Manufacturing equipment used in manufacturing/processing is exempt. Utah Code §59-12-104(14). [T1]
- The manufacturer must provide an exemption certificate to the seller. [T1]
- Office equipment, vehicles, and non-production items do NOT qualify. [T1]
- **Flag for reviewer:** Maintain documentation of equipment use in manufacturing. [T2]

### Test 7 -- Origin-Based Intrastate Sale

**Input:** Seller in Salt Lake City (combined rate 7.75%) ships to buyer in Provo (combined rate 7.25%). Both in Utah.
**Expected output:** Intrastate sale uses origin-based sourcing. Rate = 7.75% (seller's SLC rate). Tax = sale price x 7.75%.

### Test 8 -- Manufacturing Equipment Exempt

**Input:** Manufacturer buys $100,000 production equipment for Utah plant.
**Expected output:** Manufacturing equipment exempt. Tax = $0. Total = $100,000.
