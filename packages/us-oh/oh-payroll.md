# Ohio Payroll — Tier 2 Content Skill

## 1. Scope

This skill governs **Ohio employer payroll compliance for tax year 2025** for businesses with employees physically working in Ohio (resident or non-resident of Ohio), including remote workers whose home office is in an Ohio municipality. It covers:

- **Ohio Personal Income Tax (PIT) withholding** — Form IT 4 (employee certificate), IT 501 (monthly deposit), IT 941 (quarterly/annual return), IT 3 (W-2 transmittal reconciliation)
- **Ohio State Unemployment Insurance (SUI)** — Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS), Form JFS-20125 quarterly contribution + wage report
- **Ohio Municipal Income Tax** — the single most complex U.S. state-local payroll obligation, with **600+ taxing municipalities**, three collection regimes (RITA, CCA, direct-file), and the post-SB 22 (2021) **20-day work-in-municipality threshold**
- **Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC)** — mandatory state-fund workers' comp (Ohio is a monopolistic state)
- **Worker classification** — Ohio uses the 20-factor IRS common-law test plus statutory carve-outs

**Out of scope:** Ohio Commercial Activity Tax (see `oh-commercial-activity-tax.md`), Ohio personal income tax return preparation for individuals (see `oh-income-tax.md`), school district income tax (separate withholding obligation handled in a future companion skill), federal payroll (Form 941, FUTA, FICA — federal skill), and household employees (Schedule H — federal skill).

**Reviewer assumption:** every output of this skill must be reviewed and signed off by a credentialed payroll professional (CPP, CPA, or Ohio-registered tax preparer) before payroll is run or returns are filed.

## 2. Ohio Personal Income Tax Withholding

### 2.1 2025 brackets and the phase-down

Ohio is in the middle of a multi-year statutory phase-down of its individual income tax. Under HB 33 (2023) and confirmed in HB 96 (2025 budget bill), the 2025 brackets for Ohio Adjusted Gross Income (after the $26,050 zero-bracket exemption) are:

| Taxable income (OH AGI less exemptions) | 2025 marginal rate |
|---|---|
| $0 — $26,050 | 0.00% |
| $26,051 — $100,000 | 2.75% |
| $100,001 and above | 3.50% |

**Phase-down trajectory:**
- 2023: top rate 3.99% (four brackets)
- 2024: top rate 3.50%, three brackets (consolidated)
- 2025: top rate **3.50%** (held flat per HB 96)
- 2026: top rate **3.125%** (HB 96 sets a glide path)
- 2027 target: **flat 2.75%** if revenue triggers are met

For payroll withholding, the Ohio Department of Taxation publishes withholding tables under O.A.C. 5703-7-10. The 2025 tables continue to compute withholding using a simplified two-tier method approximating the 2.75% / 3.50% structure, after applying the personal exemption amounts ($2,400 / $2,150 / $1,900 tiered by federal AGI under R.C. 5747.025).

### 2.2 Supplemental wage withholding

Ohio does **not** publish a separate statutory supplemental rate. The Department's withholding guidelines (Employer's Withholding Tax Guide, rev. 1/2025) instruct employers to:
- **Aggregate method**: combine supplemental wages with regular wages and withhold using normal tables, **OR**
- **Flat method**: withhold at **3.5%** on supplemental payments (bonuses, commissions, severance) — this approximates the top marginal rate.

Most payroll systems default to the 3.5% flat method for bonuses paid separately. This is acceptable to the Department and is the practical industry standard.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Some payroll providers still use the legacy 3.50% rate that was set when the top marginal was 3.99%. Verify your provider has updated to 3.5% for 2025 — and confirm whether they apply the flat rate to severance (which Ohio treats as supplemental wages, not regular wages, for withholding).

### 2.3 Form IT 4 — Employee's Withholding Exemption Certificate

Every Ohio employee must file **Form IT 4** (the state W-4 equivalent) on hire and any time their exemption status changes. IT 4 captures:
- Personal exemptions claimed (line 1)
- Dependent exemptions (line 2)
- **Residence school district number** (line 4) — this is the trigger for school district income tax withholding if the district has an income tax
- **Resident municipality** (line 5) — used to determine the "courtesy withholding" obligation
- Additional Ohio withholding requested (line 6)

If an employee fails to file IT 4, the employer must withhold as if **zero exemptions** are claimed and the employee is **single** (R.C. 5747.06(A)).

**IT 4 must be retained by the employer for at least 4 years.** It is not filed with the Department, but is producible on audit.

### 2.4 Deposit frequency — IT 501 vs. IT 941 quarterly

Ohio assigns deposit frequency based on the employer's **prior 12-month withholding** under O.A.C. 5703-7-04:

| Prior 12-month OH withholding | Frequency | Form | Due date |
|---|---|---|---|
| < $2,000 | Quarterly | IT 941 (quarterly return) | Last day of month after quarter end |
| $2,000 – $84,000 | Monthly | IT 501 | 15th of month after month end |
| > $84,000 | Partial-weekly | IT 501 + EFT | Wednesday after Wed-Fri payday; Friday after Sat-Tue payday |

**Annual return: IT 941** is the annual reconciliation filed by **January 31** following the calendar year. The IT 3 transmittal (Section 8) accompanies the W-2 copies.

**Quarterly filers** use IT 941 as both the deposit voucher and the annual return — there is no separate quarterly form for small employers; the IT 941 covers the full year filing for those under the $2,000 threshold.

**E-file mandate:** any employer with prior-year Ohio withholding exceeding $84,000, or with 250+ W-2s to issue, must file IT 941 and IT 3 electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway (OBG) under O.A.C. 5703-7-19.

### 2.5 Penalties

- **Late filing**: greater of $50/month or 5% of tax due per month, capped at 50% of tax (R.C. 5747.15)
- **Late deposit**: 50% of underpayment (statutory under R.C. 5747.071) — Ohio is unusually harsh here; the federal trust fund recovery analog is 100% but is only assessed against responsible persons. Ohio's 50% is automatic on the entity.
- **Failure to file IT 3 / W-2s**: $50 per W-2 not transmitted, capped at $25,000.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Ohio's 50% late-deposit penalty is automatic and **assessed even if the tax is paid one day late**. Set deposit reminders. Abatement requires a written showing of reasonable cause, and the Department's abatement rate is low.

## 3. Ohio State Unemployment Insurance (SUI)

### 3.1 Wage base and rates

For 2025:
- **Taxable wage base: $9,000** per employee per year (unchanged from 2024)
- **Rate range: 0.30% – 9.80%** (the 9.80% includes the mutualized rate component)
- **New employer rate: 2.70%** for non-construction; **5.60%** for construction (O.A.C. 4141-9-04)
- **Mutualized account rate add-on**: 0.0% for 2025 (the trust fund is solvent; the mutualized add-on was zeroed out in late 2024 by the Unemployment Compensation Advisory Council)

### 3.2 Reporting and payment

SUI is reported via **Form JFS-20125** (Quarterly Contribution and Wage Report) through ODJFS's **ERIC** (Employer Resource Information Center) portal. Due:

| Quarter | Due date |
|---|---|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 30 |
| Q2 (Apr-Jun) | July 31 |
| Q3 (Jul-Sep) | October 31 |
| Q4 (Oct-Dec) | January 31 |

**SUTA dumping** (transferring employees to a lower-rated entity) is prohibited by R.C. 4141.244 with criminal penalties and rate reassignment going back to the date of transfer.

### 3.3 Coverage

Most for-profit employers are covered once they:
- Pay $1,500+ in wages in any quarter of the current or prior year, OR
- Employ at least one worker in any portion of 20 different weeks in the current or prior year.

Agricultural employers have a separate $20,000-quarter / 10-worker threshold.

**Nonprofit 501(c)(3) employers** with 4+ employees may elect **reimbursement** instead of contributions (R.C. 4141.241) — they pay back the trust fund dollar-for-dollar for actual UI claims paid to former employees.

## 4. Municipal Income Tax — The Painful Center of Ohio Payroll

Ohio is the only U.S. state where **municipal income tax** is the dominant local payroll complexity. There are **600+ taxing municipalities** (cities and villages), each with its own:
- Rate (range **1.00% – 3.00%**, most cluster between 2.0% and 2.5%)
- Credit for taxes paid to other municipalities (range 0% to 100% of the resident rate)
- Filing forms (though three centralized agencies handle most of them)
- Definition of "taxable income" (largely conformed by HB 5 (2014) but not entirely)

Ohio Revised Code Chapter 718 governs the uniform municipal income tax framework. HB 5 (2014) imposed uniform definitions and the 20-day rule. SB 22 (2021) **rewrote the 20-day rule** to the form discussed below.

### 4.1 The three collection regimes

#### 4.1.1 RITA — Regional Income Tax Agency

- Collects for **~330 Ohio municipalities** (the largest network)
- Members include most Cleveland-area suburbs (excluding Cleveland itself), Akron-area, much of Dayton suburban ring, Toledo suburbs, and many central-Ohio villages
- Single combined return: **Form 11 / Form 17** for individual; **Form 27** (employer year-end withholding reconciliation); **Form 11A** or online portal for monthly/quarterly remittance
- Withholding remittance frequency: monthly if prior-quarter withholding exceeded $2,399; quarterly otherwise
- Annual reconciliation **Form 11** due by **February 28** following the tax year

**RITA members are searchable at ritaohio.com.** The employer is responsible for verifying every workplace and resident municipality against the current member list — RITA's coverage changes (cities occasionally leave or join).

#### 4.1.2 CCA — Central Collection Agency (Division of Taxation, City of Cleveland)

- Collects for **~50 Ohio municipalities**, including **Cleveland (the City itself), Akron (since 2024 reform — verify current status), Cleveland Heights, Parma, and others** (note: Akron historically self-administered; recent membership changes apply — confirm against current CCA member roster)
- Form **CCA-W3** is the annual withholding reconciliation
- Monthly remittance Form CCA-117 if prior-year withholding ≥ $2,400; quarterly Form CCA-119 otherwise
- CCA is operated by the City of Cleveland Division of Taxation — its rules can deviate slightly from RITA's, particularly around courtesy withholding for residents

#### 4.1.3 Direct-file cities

These cities administer their own income tax and **do not use RITA or CCA**:
- **Columbus** (Division of Income Tax)
- **Cincinnati** (Income Tax Division)
- **Dayton** (Division of Tax & Accounting Administration)
- **Toledo** (Division of Taxation)
- **Lakewood** (a notable Cleveland-area exception)
- Several smaller villages

Each direct-file city has its own forms, portals, and deposit schedules. Columbus uses **Form IT-11** for employer reconciliation; Cincinnati uses **Form W-3**; Dayton uses **Form D-W3**; Toledo uses **Form W-3**.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Misrouting withholding (sending Cleveland-resident withholding to RITA instead of CCA, or sending Columbus withholding to RITA) is a high-frequency error. RITA and CCA generally **do not forward** misrouted funds — the employer must reclaim from the wrong agency and re-remit to the correct one, while penalties accrue at the correct municipality. Always validate routing using the official municipality lookup tools each year.

### 4.2 The withholding rule — workplace municipality

For each pay period, the employer must:

1. Determine **where the employee physically performed services** (the "principal place of work" by day count for that pay period)
2. Withhold at the **workplace municipality's resident/non-resident rate** on wages earned while physically in that municipality
3. If the workplace municipality is different from the employee's resident municipality, **courtesy withholding** to the resident municipality is **optional but common** (and frequently required by collective bargaining agreements or municipal ordinance for resident-rate employers)

Wages earned outside any taxing municipality (e.g., at a worksite in an unincorporated township, or in another state) are not subject to Ohio municipal withholding, but may still be subject to OH state withholding.

### 4.3 The 20-day work-in-municipality threshold (post-SB 22)

R.C. 718.011 (as rewritten by SB 22, effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2021, and confirmed by HB 110 (2021)) provides the **20-day rule**:

> An employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on wages paid to an employee for work performed in a non-principal-place-of-work municipality **until the 21st day** that the employee performs services in that municipality during the calendar year. Once the 20-day threshold is exceeded, the employer must withhold for **all days, including the first 20**, retroactive to day one of work in that municipality.

**Key mechanics:**

- **"Day"** = any portion of a day spent performing services in the municipality (R.C. 718.011(A)(1) — a part-day counts as a full day)
- **Counted by calendar year**, resetting each January 1
- **Small employer exception**: employers with prior-year total revenue under **$500,000** are exempt from the 20-day non-resident withholding obligation entirely (R.C. 718.011(D)) — they withhold only for the principal place of work
- **Trigger is retroactive**: once day 21 hits, withholding is owed on days 1–20 as well, requiring a catch-up remittance (and possibly amended W-2 municipal lines if year-end is approaching)
- **Telework cleanup**: SB 22 also rolled back the pandemic-era H.B. 197 §29 fiction that treated remote work as occurring at the principal place of work. From 2022 forward, **remote-work days are sourced to the employee's actual physical location**, which for most home-office employees is their resident municipality.

**Worked example (20-day rule):**

> A Cleveland-resident employee normally works at the employer's Independence office (RITA member, 2.0%). On August 15, the employee starts a 60-day project at the customer site in Westlake (RITA member, 1.5%). The employee works in Westlake Monday–Thursday and returns to Independence Friday.
>
> Through October 14 (Day 21 of Westlake work), the employer was withholding only for Independence. On October 14, the employer must:
> 1. Begin withholding for Westlake at 1.5% on Westlake-day wages going forward
> 2. Compute the Westlake withholding owed on the prior 20 Westlake days (Aug 15 – Oct 13) and remit it
> 3. Refund or credit back to the employee (or to Independence withholding) the Independence withholding that was over-collected on those 20 Westlake days, **only if** the employer had been withholding the Independence rate on Westlake-day wages (which it was, under the under-20-day default)
> 4. Issue W-2 Box 18/19/20 lines reflecting both Independence and Westlake correctly at year end

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** **Missed 20-day catch-up withholding** is the single most common Ohio municipal payroll audit finding. Employers with project-based remote-employee deployments (consultants, engineers, sales reps, IT installers) must maintain a **day-by-day workplace log per employee per municipality** and have a triggering report that fires at day 21. Many payroll providers do not natively support this — it requires manual oversight.

### 4.4 Resident municipality "courtesy" withholding

When an employee works in Municipality A but resides in Municipality B:
- **Municipality A withholding is mandatory** at A's non-resident rate (subject to the 20-day rule)
- **Municipality B withholding is optional courtesy withholding** — most large employers do it as a service to the employee
- If Municipality B is provided a **credit** for tax paid to Municipality A, B's withholding obligation may be zero or partial (computed at B's resident rate less the credit allowed)

The credit percentage varies dramatically: some cities (e.g., **Cleveland Heights**) grant a 100% credit up to the resident rate, while others (e.g., **Cincinnati**) grant a credit limited to the lesser of (i) the tax paid elsewhere or (ii) the resident rate, and a small number grant **no credit**.

The employee's IT 4 (line 5 residence municipality) plus the employer's own knowledge of the workplace municipality drives the courtesy withholding determination. **Best practice**: collect a separate employer-internal "municipal residency certification" at hire, distinct from IT 4, capturing the precise street address (RITA/CCA/direct-file city lookup tools resolve by address, not ZIP).

### 4.5 Multi-municipality remote workers

The post-2022 remote-work environment has produced a new high-audit-risk pattern: the employee who works partially at home (resident municipality), partially at the employer's office (workplace municipality), and partially at customer sites (third municipalities).

**Rule:** withholding must be allocated to each municipality based on actual days worked there, with the 20-day non-resident threshold applied separately to each non-principal-place-of-work municipality.

**Worked example (multi-municipality remote worker):**

> Employee resides in Dublin (direct-file with Columbus suburbs — Dublin is actually a separate direct-file city, 2.0%). The employer's office is in Columbus (direct-file, 2.5%). The employee works 3 days per week at home in Dublin, 2 days per week at the Columbus office.
>
> - **Dublin** is the employee's resident municipality and (for telework days) the workplace. The 20-day rule does not protect the employer here because Dublin is exceeded almost immediately (3 days/week × any number of weeks > 20 days quickly). The employer must withhold for Dublin on the telework-day wages at Dublin's rate. Because Dublin is also the resident municipality, no credit issue arises.
> - **Columbus** is the workplace for in-office days. The employer must withhold for Columbus on those days at Columbus's non-resident rate (2.5%). Columbus grants a **0% credit** for tax paid to other municipalities for individual taxpayers, but the employer's allocation is based on actual days, so no credit-side issue arises at the employer level.
> - Both withholdings go to direct-file cities (Dublin and Columbus). The employer files separate withholding returns with each.
>
> **W-2 reporting:** Box 18 (local wages) and Box 19 (local tax) appear **twice** — one line for Dublin, one for Columbus. Box 20 holds the municipality name. The state tax (Boxes 15-17) is reported once for Ohio.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** **Misallocated remote work** is the second-most-common Ohio municipal audit finding (after missed 20-day triggers). Employers must require employees to attest to their work location and maintain logs. The Ohio Tax Department and many municipalities have indicated they will rely on **employer records first**; absence of records leads to assessment at the workplace municipality rate for all wages (worst-case outcome).

### 4.6 W-2 reporting to municipalities

Every Ohio W-2 with municipal withholding must be transmitted to each municipality (or to RITA/CCA on its behalf) by the **federal W-2 due date (January 31)**. The transmittal is:
- **RITA**: Form 17, submitted electronically through RITA's eFiling portal
- **CCA**: Form CCA-W3, submitted via the CCA portal
- **Direct-file cities**: each city's annual reconciliation form (Columbus IT-13, Cincinnati W-2, etc.)

**E-file mandate:** RITA, CCA, Columbus, Cincinnati, Dayton, and Toledo all require electronic W-2 transmittal for any employer issuing 10+ municipally-taxable W-2s (some thresholds vary).

## 5. Bureau of Workers' Compensation (BWC)

### 5.1 Monopolistic state — no private market

Ohio is one of **four monopolistic states** (along with North Dakota, Washington, Wyoming) where workers' compensation insurance must be purchased through the **state-run BWC fund**. Private workers' comp insurance is **not available** for the primary policy.

- Exceptions: **self-insurance** is permitted under R.C. 4123.35 for employers with sufficient net worth (typically $5M+ in net assets) and a track record demonstrating ability to pay claims directly. Self-insurance applications are reviewed by BWC and require posting of security.
- **Federal employees, railroad workers, and longshoremen** are covered by federal programs, not BWC.

### 5.2 Coverage requirement

Every Ohio employer with **at least one employee** (full-time, part-time, or seasonal) must have BWC coverage. Independent contractors are not covered unless the employer elects to cover them.

### 5.3 Premium computation

BWC premium = (manual rate per $100 of payroll) × (payroll subject to BWC) × (experience modifier) × (any program discounts).

- **Manual classifications**: BWC uses NCCI-style class codes (e.g., 8810 clerical, 5403 carpentry) with Ohio-specific rates
- **Maximum reportable wage per employee** for premium computation: $35,800 for policy year July 1, 2024 – June 30, 2025; **$38,300** for policy year July 1, 2025 – June 30, 2026
- **Minimum premium**: $120 per policy year per employer

### 5.4 Reporting

- **True-up report**: due **August 15** following the policy-year end (June 30). Reports actual payroll for the prior policy year. Failure to file true-up triggers loss of all program discounts and a non-compliance flag.
- **Installment payments**: BWC requires monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual, or annual installments based on premium size. Default is bi-monthly for new employers.

### 5.5 Penalties

- **Failure to maintain coverage**: BWC can assess back premium plus interest plus a 100% penalty, and the employer loses statutory immunity from employee injury lawsuits (R.C. 4123.74)
- **Late true-up**: forfeiture of discounts averaging 4-15% of annual premium

## 6. Worker Classification

Ohio R.C. 4141.01(B)(2)(k) for SUI purposes and R.C. 4123.01(A)(1) for BWC purposes both adopt the **20-factor IRS common-law test** (Rev. Rul. 87-41) for distinguishing employees from independent contractors. The 20 factors fall into three categories:

**Behavioral control** (factors 1-11):
1. Instructions — employer's right to direct how, when, where work is done
2. Training — employer-provided training suggests employee
3. Integration — services integrated into business operations
4. Services rendered personally — must the worker do the work themselves?
5. Hiring assistants — does the worker hire and pay helpers?
6. Continuing relationship — recurring engagement suggests employee
7. Set hours of work — fixed hours suggest employee
8. Full-time required — full-time exclusivity suggests employee
9. Doing work on employer's premises
10. Order or sequence set — employer directing sequence suggests employee
11. Reports — required oral or written reports suggest employee

**Financial control** (factors 12-15):
12. Payment by hour, week, or month (vs. by job) — periodic pay suggests employee
13. Payment of business and travel expenses — reimbursement suggests employee
14. Furnishing tools and materials — employer-furnished suggests employee
15. Significant investment — worker's substantial investment in own equipment suggests contractor

**Relationship of the parties** (factors 16-20):
16. Realization of profit or loss — bearing financial risk suggests contractor
17. Working for more than one firm at a time
18. Making services available to general public
19. Right to discharge — at-will termination suggests employee
20. Right to terminate — worker's right to walk away without breach suggests contractor

**Ohio-specific statutory presumptions:**
- **Construction industry**: R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(c) creates a presumption that **construction workers are employees** unless the hiring entity proves all 10 statutory factors (capital investment, separate business identity, etc.) under the construction-industry test
- **Real estate agents and salespersons**: statutorily classified as **non-employees** under R.C. 4123.01(A)(2)(c) if licensed and paid solely on commission with no employee-style benefits
- **Direct sellers**: statutorily non-employees under conditions mirroring IRC §3508

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Ohio BWC audits independent contractor relationships aggressively, particularly in construction, delivery, and gig economy contexts. A reclassification finding triggers:
1. Retroactive BWC premium for all reclassified workers (4-6 years lookback)
2. Retroactive SUI contributions (subject to ODJFS's 3-year SOL)
3. Retroactive OH withholding under R.C. 5747.06
4. Loss of statutory employer immunity from injury suits for those workers
5. Potential 1099-to-W-2 reclassification at the IRS level (which often follows once ODJFS reports)

## 7. Healthy Families and Workplaces Act — Status

The Ohio "Healthy Families and Workplaces Act" (variously proposed in HB 22, HB 230, and recurring iterations) would mandate employer-provided paid sick leave. **As of November 2025, no version has been enacted into law.** Ohio currently has **no state-mandated paid sick leave**. Some Ohio cities (notably **Columbus**, which considered but did not pass a 2024 ordinance) have proposed local paid leave; **none has been enacted as of 2025**. The state preemption statute (R.C. 4113.85) prohibits local minimum-wage and benefits mandates from being inconsistent with state law, which has chilled municipal action.

**Employers are not required to provide paid sick leave by Ohio law.** Federal FMLA (50+ employees) and federal CARES/FFCRA leave (expired) are the only mandatory leave categories for most Ohio employers.

## 8. IT 3 Annual Reconciliation and W-2 Transmittal

**Form IT 3** is Ohio's W-2 transmittal form, due **January 31** following the calendar year, accompanying the W-2 copies. IT 3 reports:
- Total Ohio wages paid
- Total Ohio income tax withheld
- Total Ohio school district income tax withheld
- Count of W-2s issued

**E-filing required** for employers issuing 250+ W-2s or with prior-year withholding exceeding $84,000.

The W-2 must include:
- Box 15: OH
- Box 16: Ohio wages (generally matches federal Box 1, subject to limited Ohio-specific add-backs/subtractions)
- Box 17: Ohio income tax withheld
- Box 18, 19, 20: **each** municipality with withholding (multiple lines if multi-municipality)
- Box 19 must also include any **school district income tax** withholding, with Box 20 showing the 4-digit district number (this is a parallel system to municipal — out of scope for this skill)

## 9. Worked Examples

### Example 1: Cleveland employer with RITA suburbs

**Facts:** ABC Manufacturing, Inc. has its office in **Independence, Ohio** (RITA member, workplace rate 2.0%). It has 40 employees, all working at the Independence office. Employees live across multiple cities: Cleveland (CCA, resident rate 2.5%, 100% credit for tax paid elsewhere), Parma (CCA, 2.5%, 100% credit), Brecksville (RITA, 2.0%, 100% credit), Independence (RITA, 2.0% — same as workplace, no credit issue), Lakewood (direct-file, 1.5%, 100% credit).

**Withholding strategy:**

1. **Workplace withholding (mandatory):** all 40 employees, withhold Independence 2.0% non-resident rate on 100% of wages → remit to **RITA** monthly via Form CCA-117... no wait, that's CCA. **RITA Form 11A** (or RITA online portal).

2. **Courtesy withholding (resident-side) — optional but recommended:**
   - **Cleveland residents** (3 employees): Cleveland resident rate is 2.5%, credit 100% up to resident rate. Since Independence rate (2.0%) < Cleveland rate (2.5%), Cleveland residents owe Cleveland an additional 0.5% on Independence-earned wages. Many employers withhold this 0.5% as courtesy. **Routes to CCA.**
   - **Parma residents** (2 employees): same analysis — Parma 2.5%, credit 100%, owe 0.5%. **Routes to CCA.**
   - **Brecksville residents** (5 employees): Brecksville 2.0%, credit 100%, owe 0%. No courtesy needed.
   - **Independence residents** (12 employees): workplace = residence, single withholding only.
   - **Lakewood residents** (3 employees): Lakewood 1.5%, credit 100% on 1.5% of Independence wage, owe 0% (Lakewood rate ≤ Independence rate). No courtesy needed.

3. **Quarterly filings:**
   - **RITA Form 11** annual + monthly remittances for all Independence withholding + Brecksville-courtesy (zero) + Lakewood (zero)
   - **CCA Form CCA-117** monthly for Cleveland and Parma courtesy 0.5%
   - **Note:** Even though Independence is RITA, the Cleveland and Parma courtesy withholding must be remitted to **CCA**, not RITA, because Cleveland and Parma are CCA members.

4. **Year-end W-2 boxes** for a Cleveland-resident employee:
   - Box 18: Independence wages, Box 19: Independence tax, Box 20: "INDEPENDENCE"
   - Box 18: Cleveland wages, Box 19: Cleveland courtesy tax (0.5%), Box 20: "CLEVELAND"

5. **IT 3 / IT 941** reconciliation: filed with Ohio Department of Taxation for the state-level 3.5%-or-less withholding, separate from the municipal filings.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** A common error is to send the Cleveland courtesy withholding to RITA (because the employer is "primarily a RITA filer"). RITA will accept the funds and book them to Cleveland... wait, no — RITA does **not** collect for Cleveland (Cleveland is CCA). RITA will reject or hold the funds, and Cleveland's claim against the employer accrues penalties. **Always route by destination municipality, not by employer's primary agency.**

### Example 2: Columbus direct-file employer

**Facts:** XYZ Tech LLC has its office in **Columbus, Ohio** (direct-file, 2.5%). It has 25 employees, all working at the Columbus office. Employees live in Columbus (15), Dublin (4, direct-file, 2.0%, no credit), Worthington (3, RITA, 2.5%, 100% credit), Westerville (2, RITA, 2.0%, 100% credit), and Bexley (1, direct-file, 2.5%, 100% credit).

**Withholding strategy:**

1. **Workplace withholding (mandatory):** all 25 employees, withhold Columbus 2.5% non-resident rate on 100% of wages → remit to **City of Columbus Division of Income Tax** monthly (via Columbus's CRISP portal). Use Columbus's own monthly deposit form.

2. **Courtesy withholding:**
   - **Columbus residents** (15): workplace = residence, single withholding only.
   - **Dublin residents** (4): Dublin 2.0%, **no credit** for tax paid elsewhere. The employee owes Dublin 2.0% **in addition to** Columbus 2.5%, with no offset. Courtesy withholding to Dublin is highly recommended to avoid the employee receiving a large Dublin balance due at filing. **Routes to City of Dublin** (direct-file).
   - **Worthington residents** (3): 2.5%, 100% credit. Columbus 2.5% credit covers full Worthington 2.5%. Owe 0%. No courtesy.
   - **Westerville residents** (2): 2.0%, 100% credit. Columbus 2.5% > Westerville 2.0%, so Westerville credit fully offsets. Owe 0%. No courtesy.
   - **Bexley residents** (1): 2.5%, 100% credit. Same as Worthington. Owe 0%. No courtesy.

3. **Filings:**
   - **Columbus IT-11** annual reconciliation + monthly remittances
   - **Dublin Form IT-13** annual + monthly remittances for the Dublin courtesy
   - **No RITA filings** (Worthington and Westerville withholdings are zero; nothing to remit, but employer must still register if it ever has courtesy withholding to those cities)

4. **Annotation for the Dublin case:** Because Dublin grants no credit and Columbus is the workplace, **Dublin residents face economic double municipal tax** (2.0% + 2.5% = 4.5% total on Columbus-earned wages). This is legally correct and expected — Dublin chose not to grant a credit. Employees should be informed.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Some employers incorrectly assume Dublin grants a credit (because most cities do). The **no-credit cities** must be tracked individually — they include Dublin, Cincinnati (for non-residents), and a handful of others. **Always look up credit policy by destination, never assume.**

### Example 3: Multi-municipality remote worker triggering 20-day rule

**Facts:** Delta Consulting LLC has its office in **Akron** (CCA member, workplace rate 2.5%, prior-year revenue $3.2M so the small-employer exception does NOT apply). Sarah is a consultant who lives in **Hudson** (RITA, resident rate 2.0%, 100% credit). Sarah's pattern in 2025:

- Jan 1 – Jun 30: works 4 days/week at the Akron office, 1 day/week telework from Hudson (26 weeks × 1 day = 26 Hudson telework days; well above 20)
- Jul 1 – Aug 31: works 3 days/week at a customer site in **Beachwood** (RITA, 2.0%) and 2 days/week at Akron. Total Beachwood days through Aug 31: ~26 days (above 20)
- Sep 1 – Dec 31: returns to Akron full-time (5 days/week)

**Withholding analysis:**

**Hudson (resident municipality, also telework workplace):**
- The 1-day-per-week telework allocates 26 days to Hudson for the first half of the year, exceeding the 20-day threshold by approximately Day 21 (~late May). HOWEVER, Hudson is Sarah's **resident municipality**, and the 20-day rule under R.C. 718.011 only protects against **non-resident** municipal withholding. Because Hudson is Sarah's residence, the resident-municipality rules apply, and Hudson-rate withholding on Hudson telework days is appropriate from Day 1 (subject to credit for Akron tax withheld on Akron days).
- Practical result: employer should set up **resident courtesy withholding** for Hudson from Day 1, with Hudson credit for Akron tax = full 2.0% Hudson rate (because Akron's 2.5% withheld exceeds Hudson's 2.0% rate). Net Hudson withholding owed on Akron-day wages = 0. Net Hudson withholding owed on Hudson telework-day wages = 2.0% (no credit because no other municipality is taxing those wages).
- **Route:** Hudson is a RITA member → remit to RITA.

**Akron (workplace municipality, principal place of work):**
- Akron is the principal place of work. Withhold 2.5% on all Akron-day wages from Day 1 → remit to **CCA** (Akron is CCA per current member roster — confirm).
- No 20-day issue (principal place of work is always subject to withholding from Day 1).

**Beachwood (non-resident, non-principal-place-of-work municipality):**
- Sarah starts Beachwood work July 1. The employer should NOT withhold Beachwood tax for the first 20 Beachwood-days under R.C. 718.011.
- Approximately Day 21 hits in early August (July 1, 2, 3 = 3 days week 1; 3 days/week for ~7 weeks → Day 21 hits around Aug 12).
- **On Day 21 trigger:** the employer must:
  - Begin withholding Beachwood 2.0% non-resident rate on Beachwood-day wages going forward
  - Compute Beachwood withholding on the first 20 Beachwood-days (retroactive) and remit a catch-up to RITA (Beachwood is RITA)
  - Adjust Akron withholding: the employer had been (incorrectly, but per the 20-day default) withholding Akron 2.5% on Beachwood-day wages during Days 1-20 (because under 20-day rule, the wages were sourced to principal place of work). The CCA position on whether Akron tax was correctly withheld on those Beachwood days is nuanced — best practice is to leave Akron withholding alone for the under-20 days (since Akron tax was legitimately owed under the default sourcing) and **not** apply a Beachwood credit to it; the catch-up to Beachwood is incremental.

> **Important interpretive note:** R.C. 718.011 and the 2021-2025 guidance from the Ohio Department of Taxation are not fully settled on whether the Day-21 catch-up to Beachwood is an *addition* to Akron tax already withheld, or a *reallocation* (with Akron refund and Beachwood payment). The conservative, dominant practice is **reallocation** — Akron withholding on those 20 days is refunded/credited back via amended Akron filing, and Beachwood withholding is remitted fresh. Confirm with the relevant municipalities for any large-dollar case.

**Year-end W-2 lines for Sarah:**
- Box 18/19/20: Akron — wages and tax for all Akron days (4 days/week Jan-Jun + 2 days/week Jul-Aug + 5 days/week Sep-Dec)
- Box 18/19/20: Hudson — wages and tax for Hudson telework days (1 day/week Jan-Jun)
- Box 18/19/20: Beachwood — wages and tax for Beachwood days post-Day-21 catch-up (3 days/week Jul-Aug, all days)

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** This pattern is the **canonical Ohio payroll audit nightmare**: three municipalities (Akron-CCA, Hudson-RITA, Beachwood-RITA), 20-day rule triggering mid-year, courtesy withholding for resident, and a remote-work component. Documentation requirements:
- Daily timesheet showing physical work location (employer-maintained, employee-attested)
- Monthly summary log per employee per municipality with day-count
- Day-21 trigger alert system (manual or in payroll software)
- Year-end reconciliation cross-checking each municipality's withholding remittances to the W-2 lines
