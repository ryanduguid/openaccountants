## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Nonbusiness income tax brackets (tax year 2025)

All filing statuses use the same bracket structure. Ohio does not differentiate brackets by filing status.

| Ohio taxable nonbusiness income | Tax |
|---|---|
| $0 – $26,050 | 0% (no tax) |
| $26,051 – $100,000 | $342.00 + 2.75% of excess over $26,050 |
| Over $100,000 | $2,394.32 + 3.125% of excess over $100,000 |

### Business income

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Business Income Deduction (BID) | First $250,000 excluded ($125,000 if MFS) |
| Tax rate on business income above BID | 3% flat |

### Personal exemptions (based on Ohio AGI)

| Ohio AGI | Exemption per person |
|---|---|
| $40,000 or less | $2,400 |
| $40,001 – $80,000 | $2,150 |
| $80,001 and above | $1,900 |

### Other key figures

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Standard deduction | None (Ohio does not have a state standard deduction) |
| Filing status options | Single, MFJ, MFS, HOH, QSS (follows federal) |
| Personal credits | Joint filer credit, child/dependent care credit, earned income credit (10% of federal EITC, nonrefundable), retirement income credit, lump-sum credit |
| Ohio EITC | 10% of federal EITC (nonrefundable for 2025) |

### 2026 change alert

Starting tax year 2026 (HB 96, signed June 30, 2025), Ohio moves to a true flat tax: 0% on the first $26,050 and 2.75% flat on all nonbusiness income above $26,050. The 3.125% bracket is eliminated.

---

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Ohio starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** on federal Form 1040, Line 11. Ohio then applies its own adjustments on the Ohio Schedule of Adjustments to arrive at Ohio AGI, then separates income into business and nonbusiness categories.

**Key flow:**

1. Federal AGI → Ohio Schedule of Adjustments → Ohio AGI
2. Ohio AGI → separate into business income and nonbusiness income
3. Business income: first $250,000 excluded via BID; excess taxed at 3% flat
4. Nonbusiness income: taxed at graduated rates (0% / 2.75% / 3.125%)
5. Apply exemptions and credits → Ohio income tax liability

**Ohio does NOT start from federal taxable income.** The starting point is federal AGI. Ohio does not use the federal standard or itemized deductions. Ohio has no standard deduction of its own.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Business Income Deduction (BID)

Ohio provides a significant benefit for sole proprietors through the Business Income Deduction under ORC § 5747.01(B):

- The first $250,000 of business income ($125,000 if MFS) is fully deductible — effectively taxed at 0%.
- Business income exceeding the BID threshold is taxed at a flat 3% rate, separate from the graduated nonbusiness brackets.
- "Business income" for a sole proprietor generally means Schedule C net profit, plus other income from business activity (Schedule E rental income from active businesses, farm income from Schedule F, etc.).
- The BID election is made on Ohio Schedule IT BUS.

### Self-employment tax interaction

Ohio does not impose a separate self-employment tax. The federal self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare) is computed on the federal return only. However, the deductible portion of SE tax (50% deduction on federal Schedule 1) reduces federal AGI, which flows through to reduce Ohio AGI.

### Ohio Municipal Income Tax (warning)

Most Ohio cities and many school districts levy their own local income taxes (typically 1%–3%). These are separate from state income tax and are NOT covered by this skill. Self-employed individuals must file and pay municipal income tax in their city of residence and potentially in cities where they perform work.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**R-OH-1. Federal AGI is the starting point.** Ohio IT 1040 Line 1 = federal Form 1040 Line 11 (federal AGI).

**R-OH-2. Ohio Schedule of Adjustments.** Common adjustments for self-employed filers:
- **Additions:** state/local government bond interest from other states; federal tax-exempt income items that Ohio taxes
- **Subtractions:** Ohio state/local government bond interest; Social Security benefits (Ohio fully exempts Social Security); federal interest/dividend income already taxed by Ohio; military pay (if applicable); Ohio 529 contributions (up to $4,000 per beneficiary per year)

**R-OH-3. Business vs. nonbusiness income classification.** Schedule C net profit is business income. Wage income (W-2) is nonbusiness income. Capital gains may be business or nonbusiness depending on the nature of the asset. Interest and dividends are generally nonbusiness unless generated from business activity.

**R-OH-4. BID is automatic if business income is identified.** The first $250,000 of business income is excluded. No election is required — but the taxpayer must complete Ohio Schedule IT BUS to claim the deduction.

**R-OH-5. Personal exemption is based on Ohio AGI, not federal AGI.** Use Ohio AGI to determine the per-person exemption amount ($2,400 / $2,150 / $1,900).

**R-OH-6. Ohio does not conform to OBBBA for §179 purposes.** Ohio generally conforms to the IRC as of a specific date. Verify Ohio's conformity date and determine whether OBBBA §179 and §168(k) changes flow through or require adjustment on the Ohio Schedule of Adjustments.

**R-OH-7. Social Security is fully exempt.** If federal AGI includes Social Security benefits, subtract the full amount included in federal AGI on the Ohio Schedule of Adjustments.

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**J-OH-1. Business vs. nonbusiness income classification for mixed-use assets.** When a sole proprietor sells a vehicle or equipment used partly for business and partly for personal use, judgment is needed to allocate the gain between business income (eligible for BID) and nonbusiness income.

**J-OH-2. Municipal credit on state return.** Ohio allows a credit (limited) for municipal income taxes paid. The Joint Filing Credit (for MFJ) is a separate credit on the state return. Interaction between these credits requires careful calculation.

**J-OH-3. Residency determination.** Ohio defines "resident" as an individual domiciled in Ohio. Part-year residents and nonresidents use different schedules. Flag any taxpayer who moved to or from Ohio during the year.

**J-OH-4. Ohio IRC conformity date.** Ohio's conformity to the Internal Revenue Code must be verified against the most recent budget bill. If OBBBA provisions are not conformed to, any OBBBA-specific federal deductions or exclusions may need adjustment.

## Section 7: Supplier pattern library

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| High BID utilization | Sole proprietor with >$250K Schedule C profit. Business income above BID taxed at 3% flat — often lower than nonbusiness graduated rates. |
| W-2 + Schedule C combo | Taxpayer with both W-2 wages (nonbusiness) and Schedule C profit (business). Allocate correctly between the two income categories. |
| Social Security recipient | Subtract Social Security from Ohio AGI — Ohio fully exempts. |
| Out-of-state municipal bonds | Add back interest from non-Ohio state/local government bonds on the Schedule of Adjustments. |
| Reciprocal state worker | Ohio has reciprocity agreements with IN, KY, MI, PA, WV. If taxpayer works in one of these states, only Ohio taxes the income. |

## Section 8: Form mapping

| Ohio IT 1040 line | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Line 1 | Federal AGI | Federal Form 1040, Line 11 |
| Schedule of Adjustments | Additions / subtractions | Various (see R-OH-2) |
| Line 3 | Ohio AGI | Line 1 + additions − subtractions |
| Schedule IT BUS | Business income / BID | Schedule C net profit, BID computation |
| Line 5 | Ohio taxable nonbusiness income | Ohio AGI − business income − exemptions |
| Line 8a | Nonbusiness income tax | Tax table or rate schedule |
| Line 8b | Business income tax (3% flat on excess over BID) | Schedule IT BUS |
| Line 8c | Total Ohio income tax before credits | Line 8a + Line 8b |
| Line 14 | Ohio income tax after credits | After applying all credits |
| Line 23 | Amount owed / refund | After payments and withholding |

## Section 9: Refusal catalogue

**REFUSE-OH-1.** REFUSE to prepare an Ohio return for a part-year resident or nonresident without the appropriate nonresident credit schedule. This skill covers full-year residents only.

**REFUSE-OH-2.** REFUSE to compute Ohio municipal income taxes. These are separate filings administered by individual cities and are outside the scope of this skill.

**REFUSE-OH-3.** REFUSE to compute school district income tax. Ohio has over 200 school districts with their own income taxes (traditional or earned income based). These require a separate SD 100 filing.

**REFUSE-OH-4.** REFUSE to classify ambiguous income as business or nonbusiness without reviewer guidance. Misclassification can result in significant tax differences.

**REFUSE-OH-5.** REFUSE to apply 2026 flat tax rates to a 2025 return. Tax year 2025 uses the three-bracket graduated system.
