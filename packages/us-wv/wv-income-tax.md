**All filing statuses except Married Filing Separately:**

| WV taxable income | Rate | Tax on bracket base |
|-------------------|------|---------------------|
| $0 – $10,000 | 2.11% | — |
| $10,001 – $25,000 | 2.81% | $211.00 + 2.81% of excess over $10,000 |
| $25,001 – $40,000 | 3.16% | $632.50 + 3.16% of excess over $25,000 |
| $40,001 – $60,000 | 4.22% | $1,106.50 + 4.22% of excess over $40,000 |
| $60,001 and above | 4.58% | $1,950.50 + 4.58% of excess over $60,000 |

**Married Filing Separately (brackets halved):**

| WV taxable income | Rate | Tax on bracket base |
|-------------------|------|---------------------|
| $0 – $5,000 | 2.11% | — |
| $5,001 – $12,500 | 2.81% | $105.50 + 2.81% of excess over $5,000 |

| $20,001 – $30,000 | 4.22% | $553.25 + 4.22% of excess over $20,000 |
| $30,001 and above | 4.58% | $975.25 + 4.58% of excess over $30,000 |

### Tax brackets — 2025 (pre-SB 392)

| WV taxable income | Rate |
|-------------------|------|
| $0 – $10,000 | 2.22% |
| $10,001 – $25,000 | 2.96% |

| $60,001 and above | 4.82% |

### Rate reduction history

|----------|---------|-------------|

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

West Virginia starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11.

**Flow:**
1. Federal Form 1040 is completed (including Schedule C, SE).
2. Federal AGI (Line 11) flows to West Virginia Form IT-140, Line 1.
3. West Virginia additions are applied (Schedule M, Additions).
4. West Virginia subtractions are applied (Schedule M, Subtractions).
5. West Virginia taxable income is computed.
6. Tax is computed from the rate schedule (or tax table if taxable income ≤$100,000).
7. For part-year/nonresidents: apportion using Schedule A (WV income ÷ total income × tentative tax).
8. Credits are applied.

**Key structural point:** Because WV starts from federal AGI, the federal standard deduction and QBI deduction are NOT included. West Virginia does NOT have its own standard deduction or personal exemption deduction below the line. The entire federal AGI (after WV modifications) is subject to tax. The only below-the-line relief is via credits (family tax credit, low-income earned income exclusion).

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment tax deduction
The federal deduction for 50% of self-employment tax reduces federal AGI → flows through to West Virginia automatically.

### Retirement contributions
SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI → flow through automatically.

### Health insurance deduction
Self-employed health insurance deduction reduces federal AGI → flows through automatically.

### QBI deduction (§199A)
West Virginia does NOT conform to the QBI deduction. Since WV starts from AGI (before QBI), the §199A deduction does not reduce WV taxable income. WV taxable income will be higher than federal taxable income by the standard deduction + QBI amounts.

### Home office deduction
Reduces Schedule C net profit → reduces federal AGI → flows through.

### No standard deduction
West Virginia does not offer a state-level standard deduction. The tax is computed on the entire West Virginia taxable income (federal AGI ± modifications). Low-income relief is provided through the family tax credit and low-income exclusion.

### Estimated tax payments
Required if expected WV tax liability after withholding will exceed $600. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15. Form IT-140ES (voucher).

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**[T1-WV-1] Tax computation.** Apply the graduated rate schedule to West Virginia taxable income. For TY 2026, use the SB 392 rates (2.11% – 4.58%). For taxable income ≤$100,000, use the tax table. For >$100,000, use Rate Schedule I (or Rate Schedule II for MFS).

**[T1-WV-2] Starting point.** Begin with federal adjusted gross income from Form 1040, Line 11. Enter on Form IT-140, Line 1.

**[T1-WV-3] West Virginia additions (Schedule M).** Common additions for self-employed:
- Interest/dividend income from other states' obligations (exempt federally but taxable for WV)
- Lump sum distributions not included in federal AGI
- Any income exempt from federal tax but taxable under WV law

**[T1-WV-4] West Virginia subtractions (Schedule M).** Common subtractions:
- Interest from US government obligations (Treasury bonds, savings bonds)
- Social Security benefits included in federal AGI (WV exempts)
- Railroad retirement income
- West Virginia state/local tax refund (if included in federal AGI)
- Military pay (active duty)
- WV public employee retirement benefits (partial exclusion — up to $2,000)

**[T1-WV-5] Social Security exemption.** West Virginia fully exempts Social Security benefits from state income tax. If Social Security was included in federal AGI, subtract the entire amount on Schedule M.

**[T1-WV-6] Filing due date.** April 15 following the tax year (April 15, 2026 for TY 2025). Extension: October 15 (automatic if federal extension obtained; attach copy of federal extension with WV return).

**[T1-WV-7] Estimated tax payments.** Required if expected tax after withholding exceeds $600. Quarterly due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15. Form IT-140ES. Safe harbor: pay 100% of prior year liability or 90% of current year.

**[T1-WV-8] Family tax credit.** A nonrefundable credit of $40 per exemption is available for low-income taxpayers. The credit phases out at higher income levels. Available only if WV taxable income is below the threshold in the form instructions.

**[T1-WV-9] Senior citizen tax credit.** Taxpayers 65+ with income below $50,000 (single) or $100,000 (MFJ) may claim a credit. Amount per the published schedule.

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**[T2-WV-1] Residency determination.** West Virginia defines a resident as a person domiciled in WV or maintaining a permanent place of abode in WV for more than 30 days AND being present in WV for 183+ days. Freelancers working remotely who split time between states must carefully track days.

**[T2-WV-2] Revenue trigger elimination.** West Virginia has enacted legislation (2023 HB 2526) establishing revenue triggers that could progressively reduce and ultimately eliminate the state income tax. The 2026 rates reflect an additional legislative cut (SB 392) on top of the trigger framework. Reviewer should confirm the applicable rates for the filing year against the Tax Division's published tables.

**[T2-WV-3] Multi-state credit.** West Virginia allows a credit for income taxes paid to other states on income also taxed by WV. Cannot exceed WV tax on the income sourced to the other state. Requires Schedule E (Credit for Tax Paid to Other States).

**[T2-WV-4] Business vs. hobby.** West Virginia follows the federal §183 determination. If Schedule C activity is reclassified as hobby, WV follows.

**[T2-WV-5] No standard deduction — impact on effective rate.** Because WV taxes the full AGI (after modifications) without a standard deduction, the effective tax rate on low-income self-employed can be relatively high compared to states with generous standard deductions. Reviewer should assess whether estimated payments are adequate.
