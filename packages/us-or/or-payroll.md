# Oregon Payroll Compliance — Tier 2 Content Skill

## 1. Scope

This skill is the authoritative Tier 2 content layer for Oregon employer payroll
compliance for tax year 2025. It is consumed by upstream workflow skills
(`us-tax-workflow-base`, `us-federal-return-assembly`) when an employer has
Oregon-source wages, an Oregon resident employee, or any employee performing
services within Oregon transit district boundaries.

### 1.1 What this skill covers

- Oregon Personal Income Tax (PIT) withholding from wages — brackets,
  supplemental wage rate, OR-W-4 employee certificate, Form OQ filing
- Oregon Unemployment Insurance (UI) — wage base $54,300 (the highest taxable
  UI wage base in the United States for 2025), rates 0.0%–5.4%, new-employer
  rate 2.4%
- Statewide Transit Tax (STT) — 0.1% of all Oregon wages, no wage base cap,
  applied to Oregon residents working anywhere and to non-residents performing
  services in Oregon
- Local transit district employer payroll taxes:
  - TriMet (Portland metropolitan area) — 0.8237% employer + 0.13% employee
  - Lane Transit District (Eugene/Springfield) — 0.79% employer
  - Salem Area Mass Transit District / Cherriots — 0.0036 (0.36%) employer
- Oregon Paid Leave (Paid Leave Oregon) — 0.6% total contribution, split 40/60
  employer/employee for employers with 25+ employees, 12 weeks of paid
  family/medical/safe leave benefits
- Workers' Benefit Fund (WBF) assessment — 0.66¢ per hour worked employer +
  0.66¢ per hour worked employee (1.32¢ combined)
- Final-pay rule — by end of next business day after termination by employer
- Independent contractor classification — the Oregon ABC test, codified by
  case law and adopted statutorily post-2020
- Federal interactions — Family and Medical Leave Act parity, Pay Equity Act
  2019 implications for payroll

### 1.2 What this skill does NOT cover

- Oregon Corporate Activity Tax (CAT) — see `or-corporate-activity-tax`
- Oregon individual income tax return preparation — see `or-income-tax`
- Federal payroll (FICA, FUTA, federal income tax withholding, Form 941,
  Form 940) — outside scope; covered elsewhere
- Multistate apportionment for employers outside Oregon with zero Oregon nexus
- Self-employed sole proprietor own-wage treatment — sole proprietors do not
  pay themselves W-2 wages and do not owe employer payroll taxes on owner draws
- Tribal employers and federally-recognized tribal sovereignty exemptions
- Agricultural labor exemptions under ORS 657.045 (limited scope; refer)

### 1.3 Conservative defaults

When facts are ambiguous, this skill applies the following conservative
defaults consistent with Oregon Department of Revenue (DOR), Oregon Employment
Department (OED), and Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS)
audit posture:

- Treat worker as W-2 employee unless ABC test affirmatively fails (i.e.,
  default to employee classification)
- Apply Statewide Transit Tax to all wages until exemption is documented
- Apply TriMet/Lane/Cherriots to all hours worked inside the district unless
  employer has documented evidence of work performed entirely outside
- Use the standard OR-W-4 default (single, zero allowances) when no signed
  OR-W-4 is on file
- For Paid Leave Oregon employee count, count all employees nationwide, not
  just Oregon (per OED rule)

## 2. Oregon Personal Income Tax Withholding

### 2.1 2025 brackets (single filer; married brackets are double)

| Taxable income (single)     | Marginal rate |
|-----------------------------|---------------|
| $0 – $4,300                 | 4.75%         |
| $4,301 – $10,750            | 6.75%         |
| $10,751 – $125,000          | 8.75%         |
| Over $125,000               | 9.90%         |

For married filing jointly, double the bracket thresholds (top bracket begins
at $250,000). The 9.9% top rate has been in place since 2013 and remains the
third-highest top state PIT rate in the United States after California
(13.3%) and Hawaii (11.0%).

### 2.2 Supplemental wage rate

For 2025, Oregon's supplemental wage withholding rate is **8.0%**. This rate
applies to bonuses, commissions, severance, equity vesting events, retroactive
pay, and other supplemental wages identified under IRS Pub 15 (which Oregon
incorporates by reference for definitional purposes but applies its own rate
to).

Employers may use the supplemental flat rate **or** the aggregate method that
combines the supplemental wage with the most recent regular pay period and
applies the standard withholding tables. The flat method is strongly preferred
for one-time large payments (bonuses, RSU vests) because the aggregate method
can produce mechanical over-withholding when the supplemental payment is large
relative to the regular paycheck.

### 2.3 OR-W-4 state withholding certificate

Oregon decoupled from the federal Form W-4 in 2020 when the IRS eliminated
withholding allowances. Employers must obtain a **Form OR-W-4** from every
Oregon employee. The OR-W-4 still uses an allowances system and does not mirror
the federal W-4 structure.

**Default rule when no OR-W-4 is on file:** withhold as single with zero
allowances. This is the most conservative default and the explicit DOR rule.

**OR-W-4 retention:** retain for at least four years following the last
calendar year the certificate was in effect. Submit to DOR only when requested
or when the employee claims more than 10 allowances (mandatory submission
trigger under OAR 150-316-0290).

### 2.4 Form OQ — Quarterly Oregon Combined Tax Report

Form OQ is Oregon's unified quarterly return that consolidates four employer
obligations into a single filing:

1. Oregon income tax withholding
2. Oregon UI tax (Schedule B)
3. Statewide Transit Tax (Schedule STT)
4. TriMet or Lane Transit tax (Schedule TM or LTD) if applicable

Due dates: April 30, July 31, October 31, January 31. Electronic filing via
Frances Online (Oregon Frances Online portal, which replaced OTTER) is
mandatory for employers with 250+ W-2s and strongly encouraged otherwise.

Form OR-WR (Annual Withholding Reconciliation) is due January 31 of the
following year and reconciles the four quarterly OQs to the W-2/W-3 filed
with DOR.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Form OQ filers commonly forget to attach Schedule
> STT or Schedule TM/LTD when the employer has Oregon wages but no employees
> in the transit district. The schedules must be filed with **zeros** rather
> than omitted — omission triggers a non-filer notice and a $50 penalty per
> schedule per quarter under ORS 314.400.

## 3. Oregon Unemployment Insurance — the highest UI wage base in the US

### 3.1 Wage base $54,300 for 2025

Oregon's 2025 taxable UI wage base is **$54,300**, the highest of any state.
The wage base is set annually as 80% of the state average annual wage under
ORS 657.435. For comparison:

- Oregon: $54,300
- Washington: $72,800 (Note: WA is now slightly higher under 2024 law; check
  if interstate comparison required)
- Idaho: $55,300
- Most other states: $7,000 – $20,000

Implications:
- Annual UI tax cost per employee is materially higher in Oregon than in most
  jurisdictions
- For high-earning employees, the employer reaches the wage cap by mid-year;
  for lower-earning employees, the employer pays UI tax on essentially every
  dollar
- Multistate employers must apply the **localization of work** test under
  ORS 657.030 to determine which state's wage base applies

### 3.2 Rates 0.0% – 5.4%; new employer 2.4%

Oregon uses an experience-rated system with rates ranging from 0.0% to 5.4%
in 2025. The new-employer rate for 2025 is **2.4%**. Rates are assigned
annually based on the employer's reserve ratio (cumulative contributions
minus benefits charged, divided by average annual taxable payroll).

Schedule D applies for 2025 (Oregon has eight rate schedules A–H; D is the
midpoint). The schedule is set by the OED based on the trust fund balance
ratio.

### 3.3 Employee count and Form OQ Schedule B

Schedule B of Form OQ reports each employee's wages, broken down between
taxable (capped at $54,300 YTD) and excess (above the cap). UI tax is owed
only on the taxable portion.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Employers commonly miscompute the taxable/excess
> split when an employee changes employers mid-year. The $54,300 wage base
> is per-employer per-year, not per-employee per-year across employers. A
> new hire whose YTD wages with the prior employer already exceeded $54,300
> still owes UI tax on the first $54,300 paid by the new employer.

## 4. Statewide Transit Tax — 0.1% with no cap

### 4.1 Mechanics

The Statewide Transit Tax (STT), enacted under HB 2017 (2017) and codified
at ORS 320.550, is a **0.1%** payroll tax on:

- All wages paid to Oregon residents (regardless of where work is performed)
- All wages paid to non-residents for services performed **in** Oregon

There is **no wage base cap**. The 0.1% applies to every dollar of covered
wages.

### 4.2 Who pays

The STT is an **employee-paid** tax that the employer is required to withhold
and remit. The employer does not bear the economic burden but bears full
liability for collection and remittance.

### 4.3 Filing and remittance

STT is reported on Schedule STT of Form OQ each quarter. Annual reconciliation
on Form OR-STT-A is due January 31. The STT is also reported in W-2 Box 14
with the code "ORSTT W/H" (DOR-prescribed code).

### 4.4 Common pitfalls

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Out-of-state employers with even one Oregon-resident
> remote worker frequently miss STT registration entirely. The 0.1% feels
> trivial per paycheck (e.g., $1 on a $1,000 weekly check) but compounded
> across years with no wage cap, an out-of-state employer with five Oregon
> remote employees earning $100,000 each owes $500/year STT — small in
> dollars but a 100% audit certainty given OED's data-share with DOR. The
> non-filing penalty under ORS 314.400 is the larger exposure.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** The STT applies to **non-resident remote workers
> physically in Oregon**. A consultant living in Vancouver, WA who crosses
> the river to work at a Portland client site has STT-covered wages for
> those days. The day-by-day allocation must be tracked.

## 5. Local transit district employer payroll taxes

### 5.1 TriMet — 0.8237% employer + 0.13% employee (Portland)

The TriMet (Tri-County Metropolitan Transportation District of Oregon)
employer payroll tax applies to wages paid for services performed within the
TriMet district, which encompasses most of Multnomah County, the urban
portions of Washington County, and the urban portions of Clackamas County.

- **Employer rate (2025): 0.8237%** of subject wages
- **Employee rate (2025): 0.13%** (this is the separate Paid Leave-style
  TriMet employee assessment; Note: some references treat the 0.13% as part
  of OR Paid Leave employee share — treat as separate per OAR 150-267-0020
  unless guidance updates)
- No wage base cap
- Reported on Schedule TM of Form OQ

The TriMet rate is statutorily increased by 0.0001 (1 basis point) per year
through 2026 under ORS 267.385, then capped.

### 5.2 Lane Transit District (LTD) — 0.79% employer (Eugene/Springfield)

The Lane Transit District employer payroll tax applies to wages paid for
services performed within the LTD boundary, which covers most of Lane County
including Eugene, Springfield, and surrounding communities.

- **Employer rate (2025): 0.79%** of subject wages
- No wage base cap
- Reported on Schedule LTD of Form OQ
- Similar 0.0001 annual increase through 2026 under ORS 267.385

### 5.3 Salem Area Mass Transit District (Cherriots) — 0.36%

Salem-Keizer Transit / Cherriots imposes a 0.36% (0.0036) employer payroll
tax under a separate local enabling authority. Unlike TriMet and LTD, the
Cherriots tax is administered locally rather than through Form OQ; the
employer registers with and remits to Cherriots directly.

### 5.4 Sandy / Canby / South Clackamas / others

Several smaller cities and special districts impose narrow employer payroll
taxes (typically 0.5%–0.7%) for local transit. These are jurisdiction-by-
jurisdiction and require boundary verification using the DOR's transit
district lookup tool.

### 5.5 District boundary determination

Determining whether a wage is "subject" to TriMet or LTD requires:

1. Geocoding the **work location** (not the employee's residence)
2. Cross-referencing the geocoded coordinates against the official transit
   district map (published annually by each district)
3. For remote workers, applying the principal-place-of-services test under
   OAR 150-267-0030: the location where the employee performs the majority
   of work in the quarter

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** The single most common Oregon payroll audit finding
> is misallocation between TriMet, Lane, and "no transit district." Employers
> often default all Oregon wages to TriMet because Portland is the largest
> metro, or default everything to "no district" because the employer is
> headquartered outside Oregon. Both are wrong. Each employee's work-location
> geocoding must be documented and refreshed annually, and remote-work
> reallocations during 2020–2024 created retroactive exposure that the OED
> began aggressively auditing in 2024.

## 6. Paid Leave Oregon — 0.6% combined, 12 weeks of benefits

### 6.1 Program overview

Paid Leave Oregon, enacted under HB 2005 (2019) and effective for benefits
on September 3, 2023, provides up to 12 weeks of paid leave per benefit year
(14 weeks for pregnancy-related conditions, with potential combined leave
up to 16 weeks) for:

- Family leave (bonding with a new child, caring for a family member with a
  serious health condition)
- Medical leave (the employee's own serious health condition)
- Safe leave (issues stemming from domestic violence, sexual assault,
  harassment, or stalking)

Benefits are wage-replacement up to a maximum weekly benefit indexed to
120% of the state average weekly wage (approximately $1,568.60 per week in
2025).

### 6.2 Contribution mechanics — 0.6% total, split 40/60

The combined contribution rate for 2025 is **1.0%** of wages (note: rate
increased from 1.0% at program inception; verify current rate before filing).
For purposes of this skill, assume **1.0% total** unless OED publishes a
different rate for the applicable quarter.

For employers with **25 or more employees nationwide**:
- **Employer share: 40%** of the total (0.4% of wages)
- **Employee share: 60%** of the total (0.6% of wages, withheld from
  paychecks)

For employers with **fewer than 25 employees nationwide**:
- Employer share: $0 (exempt from employer portion)
- Employee share: 0.6% of wages (still withheld)
- Small employers may opt in to employer-portion participation to qualify
  for grants

The 25-employee count is a **nationwide** headcount, not Oregon-only. A
California company with 30 employees and one Oregon remote worker is a
"25+" employer for Paid Leave Oregon purposes.

### 6.3 Wage base cap

Paid Leave Oregon contributions are capped at the Social Security wage base
($176,100 for 2025). Wages above the SS cap are not subject to Paid Leave
contributions.

### 6.4 Filing

Paid Leave Oregon contributions are reported on Schedule P of Form OQ
quarterly. The schedule is filed with both employer and employee shares
combined and remitted with Form OQ.

### 6.5 Equivalent plans

Employers may apply to OED for approval of an equivalent private plan that
provides benefits and protections at least equal to the state plan. Approved
equivalent plans exempt the employer (and its employees) from state
contributions.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** The employer/employee 40/60 split is the most
> commonly mis-coded line item in Oregon payroll. Many payroll providers
> default to 50/50 or to "employer pays all" which produces an over-payment
> by the employer and an under-withholding from the employee — and creates
> a constructive bonus to the employee that should have been included in
> federal Box 1 wages. The 40/60 must be coded explicitly.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Employers using the small-employer (<25) exemption
> often miscount by limiting to Oregon employees. OED counts nationwide.
> Misclassification as small triggers a back-assessment of employer
> contributions plus interest from program inception.

## 7. Workers' Benefit Fund Assessment

### 7.1 Mechanics

The Workers' Benefit Fund (WBF) assessment under ORS 656.506 funds programs
administered by the DCBS for injured worker reemployment and survivor
benefits. It is computed on **hours worked**, not wages.

- **Employer rate (2025): 0.66¢ per hour worked** ($0.0066)
- **Employee rate (2025): 0.66¢ per hour worked** ($0.0066)
- **Combined: 1.32¢ per hour worked** ($0.0132)

Salaried employees: use 40 hours per week (or actual hours if tracked).
Part-time employees: use actual hours.

### 7.2 Filing

WBF assessment is reported on Form OQ alongside withholding, UI, and STT.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** WBF is computed per-hour, not per-dollar. A common
> mistake is to apply a 0.0066% rate to wages, which dramatically
> under-reports. The correct base is hours worked × $0.0066.

## 8. ABC test for independent contractor classification

Oregon does not have a single statutory ABC test analog to California AB5.
However, ORS 670.600 (the "independent contractor" definition for OED and
DOR purposes) operates as a de-facto ABC test and has been strengthened by
case law and by 2020+ administrative guidance.

A worker is an independent contractor only if **all** of the following are
true:

**A.** The worker is **free from direction and control** over the means and
manner of providing services, subject only to the right of the contracting
person to specify the desired results.

**B.** The worker is **customarily engaged in an independently established
business** of the same nature as the services contracted for. Three of the
following five factors must be met:
1. Maintains a business location separate from the contracting person
2. Bears the risk of loss
3. Provides contracted services for two or more different customers within
   a 12-month period, or routinely engages in business advertising or
   solicitation
4. Makes a significant investment in the business through tools, equipment,
   or premises
5. Has the authority to hire and fire employees to perform the contracted
   services

**C.** The worker is **licensed** under ORS 671 or 701 if such license is
required for the services performed.

Failure on any of A, B, or C reclassifies the worker as a W-2 employee for
Oregon withholding, UI, STT, transit district, Paid Leave, and WBF purposes.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Software developers, designers, and other
> "professional" contractors frequently fail Prong B because they only have
> one client and do not advertise. Even with a Form 1099-NEC issued, OED
> can reclassify and impose retroactive UI, STT, transit, and Paid Leave
> taxes plus penalties under ORS 657.471.

## 9. Final pay rule

Under ORS 652.140:

- **Employer-initiated termination (firing/layoff):** all wages due by the
  end of the **next business day** after termination
- **Employee-initiated termination (quit) with 48+ hours notice:** all
  wages due on the last day worked
- **Employee-initiated termination without 48 hours notice:** all wages due
  within **five business days** or the next regular payday, whichever is
  earlier

Violation triggers penalty wages under ORS 652.150 equal to the employee's
regular daily wage rate for each day the wages remain unpaid, up to 30 days.
Penalty wages are owed even if the underpayment is minor.

## 10. Federal interactions

### 10.1 Family and Medical Leave Act parity

Paid Leave Oregon runs concurrently with federal FMLA leave when both apply.
An employer covered by both must coordinate the leave designation; treating
them as sequential (rather than concurrent) is a violation under both OED
rule and DOL guidance.

### 10.2 Oregon Pay Equity Act 2019

The Oregon Pay Equity Act (ORS 652.220) prohibits pay discrimination based
on protected class and requires equal pay for work of "comparable character."
For payroll purposes:

- Salary history inquiries are prohibited
- Pay decisions must be defensible against an "affirmative defense" requiring
  a documented equal-pay analysis within the prior three years
- Posting of salary ranges in job postings is required under separate
  amendments

Payroll system implications: maintain documented job-evaluation factors and
ensure compensation changes carry justification metadata.

## 11. Worked examples

### 11.1 Example A — Portland TriMet-area employer, single employee

**Facts:**
- Employer: Acme Software LLC, located in Portland (Multnomah County, within
  TriMet district)
- Employee: J. Smith, Oregon resident, lives and works in Portland
- 2025 gross wages: $120,000 salaried, 2,080 hours
- No bonuses

**Computation:**

| Tax                          | Base                  | Rate                | Amount        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Oregon UI (employer)         | $54,300 (capped)      | 2.4% (new emp.)     | $1,303.20     |
| Statewide Transit Tax (EE)   | $120,000              | 0.1%                | $120.00       |
| TriMet (employer)            | $120,000              | 0.8237%             | $988.44       |
| Paid Leave Oregon (employer) | $120,000              | 0.4% (40% of 1%)    | $480.00       |
| Paid Leave Oregon (employee) | $120,000              | 0.6% (60% of 1%)    | $720.00       |
| WBF (employer)               | 2,080 hours           | $0.0066/hr          | $13.73        |
| WBF (employee)               | 2,080 hours           | $0.0066/hr          | $13.73        |

**Employer total (Oregon-specific, excluding federal):** approximately
$2,785.37
**Employee withholding (Oregon-specific, excluding federal & PIT):**
approximately $853.73 plus Oregon PIT withholding from OR-W-4 table

### 11.2 Example B — Eugene Lane Transit employer

**Facts:**
- Employer: Willamette Designs Inc., located in Eugene (Lane County, within
  LTD)
- Employee: M. Garcia, Oregon resident
- 2025 gross wages: $75,000 salaried, 2,080 hours
- Employer has 30 employees nationwide

**Computation:**

| Tax                          | Base                  | Rate                | Amount        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Oregon UI (employer)         | $54,300 (capped)      | 1.8% (assumed)      | $977.40       |
| Statewide Transit Tax (EE)   | $75,000               | 0.1%                | $75.00        |
| Lane Transit (employer)      | $75,000               | 0.79%               | $592.50       |
| Paid Leave Oregon (employer) | $75,000               | 0.4%                | $300.00       |
| Paid Leave Oregon (employee) | $75,000               | 0.6%                | $450.00       |
| WBF (employer)               | 2,080 hours           | $0.0066/hr          | $13.73        |
| WBF (employee)               | 2,080 hours           | $0.0066/hr          | $13.73        |

**Employer total:** approximately $1,897.36
**Note:** Because the work is in Eugene (LTD), TriMet does **not** apply.
A common error is to dual-allocate; only the district covering the work
location applies.

### 11.3 Example C — Multistate employer, Oregon-resident remote worker

**Facts:**
- Employer: TechCorp Inc., headquartered in Austin, Texas
- Employee: K. Nguyen, lives in Bend, Oregon (Deschutes County — outside
  TriMet, LTD, and Cherriots boundaries)
- 2025 gross wages: $150,000 salaried, fully remote, 2,080 hours
- Employer has 200 employees nationwide

**Oregon obligations:**

| Tax                          | Base                  | Rate                | Amount        |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Oregon withholding           | per OR-W-4            | bracket-based       | varies        |
| Oregon UI (employer)         | $54,300               | 2.4% (new to OR)    | $1,303.20     |
| Statewide Transit Tax (EE)   | $150,000              | 0.1%                | $150.00       |

**Key observations:**
- TechCorp must register with Oregon DOR for withholding, OED for UI and
  Paid Leave, and DCBS for WBF — even with a single Oregon employee
- No transit district tax because Bend is outside all three districts
- The $1,500+ Paid Leave employee + employer combined is a non-trivial
  annual cost for a single remote hire

### 11.4 Example D — Portland employee, mid-year wage cap

**Facts:**
- Employer: Acme Software LLC (same as Example A), new hire in Q2
- Employee: D. Park, hired April 1, 2025, $200,000 annualized salary
- Prior employer (Jan–March): paid $50,000 with $50,000 in UI taxable wages

**Acme's UI obligation on Park:**
- Acme's $54,300 wage base is **not reduced** by Park's prior-employer wages
- Acme owes UI on the **first $54,300** paid to Park during 2025
- Park reaches $54,300 in Acme wages around mid-June (3 months × $16,667/mo)
- UI tax on Park (assume 2.4% new-employer): $54,300 × 2.4% = $1,303.20

This is the classic "double-count" problem unique to high-base UI states
like Oregon and Washington.

## 12. Reviewer self-checks

Before signing off on an Oregon payroll filing, the credentialed reviewer
must verify:

1. **Form OQ Schedule STT filed:** even if zero
2. **Form OQ Schedule TM/LTD filed:** correct district per work-location
   geocoding
3. **Paid Leave Oregon 40/60 split:** employer at 0.4%, employee at 0.6%
   (assuming current rate; verify rate)
4. **UI wage base $54,300:** not the federal FUTA $7,000 base
5. **STT applied with no cap:** including high earners
6. **WBF on hours, not dollars**
7. **OR-W-4 on file for every employee:** default single/zero if missing
8. **Transit district boundary geocoded:** for each work location, not
   based on employer HQ
9. **ABC test documented:** for every 1099-NEC contractor
10. **Final-pay rule timeline:** next business day for terminations

## 14. Refusals

This skill refuses to produce output when:

- The taxpayer is an Oregon **public employer** (PERS-covered) — different
  regime
- The taxpayer is an **agricultural employer** seeking the ORS 657.045
  exemption analysis without documented seasonal-worker facts
- The taxpayer is a **federally-recognized tribal entity** — sovereignty
  defenses outside scope
- The request concerns **railroad employees** (federal RRA preempts state UI)
- The request concerns **maritime employees** on navigable waters
- The request concerns a **multistate apportionment** analysis where the
  primary work state is contested between Oregon and Washington under
  ORS 657.030 localization-of-work — refer to multistate workflow
