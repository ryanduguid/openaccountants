## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Who Must Comply

**B2G (Business-to-Government):**
All suppliers to Belgian contracting authorities must issue structured e-invoices via the Mercurius platform (aligned with Peppol). In effect since the transposition of EU Directive 2014/55/EU. All federal, regional, and local public entities receive through Mercurius.

**B2B (Business-to-Business):**
From 1 January 2026, all Belgian enterprises liable to VAT must use structured e-invoices for domestic B2B transactions. A PDF sent by email or paper invoice no longer satisfies the legal invoicing requirement for in-scope transactions.

**Suppliers in scope:** All Belgian VAT taxpayers including:
- Taxable entities established in Belgium
- Belgian permanent establishments of foreign entities
- Members of Belgian VAT groups
- Taxable Belgian entities with special VAT schemes in agriculture

**Suppliers excluded:**
- Foreign entities solely registered for VAT in Belgium (without establishment)
- Belgian entities conducting only VAT-exempt activities (Art. 44 VAT Code)
- Bankrupt entities
- Entities under the special flat-rate scheme (to be abolished in 2028)

**Customers in scope:** Taxable entities providing their Belgian VAT number for local transactions.

**Customers excluded:** VAT-exempt entities and foreign taxpayers with a Belgian VAT number.

**B2C (Business-to-Consumer):**
Remains voluntary. No mandatory e-invoicing obligation for B2C transactions.

### Transaction Scope

E-invoicing applies to all domestic B2B VAT transactions in Belgium, including:
- Supplies of goods and services with Belgian place of supply
- Supplies under local reverse charge

**Not in scope:**
- Intra-community supplies
- Services taxed in another EU country
- Transactions exempt under Art. 44 of the Belgian VAT Code

| 1 January 2026 | B2B e-invoicing mandate takes effect; 3-month tolerance period begins |
| 31 March 2026 | Tolerance period ends; full enforcement begins |
| 30 June 2026 | Self-billing tolerance period ends |

| Sender Access Point | Certified Peppol Access Point used by the supplier |
| Receiver Access Point | Certified Peppol Access Point used by the buyer |

| Protocol | Peppol AS4 profile |

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### Peppol Validation Layers

1. **XML schema validation** against UBL 2.1 XSD
2. **EN 16931 business rules** (CEN/TC 434 schematrons)
3. **Peppol BIS Billing 3.0 rules** (OpenPeppol schematrons)
4. **Access Point validation** (transport-level checks: endpoint existence in SMP, document type support)

### Pre-Submission Checks

- Validate XML against UBL 2.1 schema and Peppol BIS 3.0 schematron before sending
- Verify buyer Peppol endpoint is registered in the SMP directory
- Confirm VAT category codes match the correct Belgian VAT treatment
- Ensure `BuyerReference` is populated (mandatory in Peppol BIS)
- Verify Belgian VAT number format (BE + 10 digits, check digit valid)

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Detail |
|---|---|
| Endpoint not found | Buyer is not registered in the Peppol SMP directory |
| Schema violation | XML does not conform to UBL 2.1 XSD |
| Business rule failure | Peppol BIS or EN 16931 schematron rule violated |
| Missing BuyerReference | `cbc:BuyerReference` is empty or absent |
| Invalid VAT category | Tax category code does not match the VAT rate or transaction type |
| Invalid VAT number | Belgian VAT number fails format or check-digit validation |
| Unsupported document type | Document type ID not registered for the receiver in SMP |
| Duplicate invoice | Invoice number already sent to the same buyer |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### Belgian VAT Rates (2026)

| Rate | Percentage | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 21% | Most goods and services |
| Reduced (parking) | 12% | Certain social housing, restaurant meals (food portion), margarine, tyres |
| Reduced | 6% | Basic necessities, water, pharmaceuticals, books, cultural events, renovations (conditions apply), passenger transport |
| Zero | 0% | Intra-community supplies, exports, newspapers/periodicals (from 2023) |

### Rounding Rules

- VAT calculated per line, rounded to 2 decimal places (EUR cents).
- Totals are the algebraic sum of rounded line-level amounts.
- `cac:TaxTotal/cbc:TaxAmount` must equal the sum of all `cac:TaxSubtotal/cbc:TaxAmount` values.
- Peppol BIS enforces rounding tolerance: ±0.01 per tax subtotal.

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

Each VAT rate requires a separate `cac:TaxSubtotal` element. Each invoice line must reference exactly one `cac:ClassifiedTaxCategory`. Mixed-rate invoices must not combine rates within a single line.

### Self-Billing

Under Peppol BIS Self-Billing 3.0.1, the buyer issues the invoice on behalf of the supplier. The `AccountingSupplierParty` is still the supplier (the entity providing goods/services), and the `AccountingCustomerParty` is the buyer who created the document. The `InvoiceTypeCode` must indicate self-billing (389).

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 7 years from the end of the year in which the VAT return was due (Belgian VAT Code Art. 60) |
| Extended retention | 10 years for immovable property adjustments; 15 years for new buildings |
| Format | Structured XML (original Peppol BIS format) must be retained; a human-readable rendering should also be stored |
| Integrity | Tamper-proof audit trail required; no modification to the original XML permitted |
| Accessibility | Must be available for tax inspection within Belgium or with immediate electronic access if stored elsewhere in the EU |
| Audit trail | Both sender and receiver must maintain records of transmission, receipt, and processing |
| Mercurius/Hermes | B2G invoices routed through Mercurius are archived by the platform; businesses should maintain their own copy |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

### E-Invoicing Specific Penalties (Royal Decree, July 2025)

| Infringement | Penalty (EUR) |
|---|---|
| First infringement | 1,500 |
| Second infringement | 3,000 |
| Third infringement (within 3 months of previous) | 5,000 |

Penalties are per infringement, not per invoice. A "subsequent" infringement is only classified as new if identified at least 3 months after the previous penalty, giving businesses a remediation window.

### Existing VAT Penalties (Unchanged)

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Late issuance of invoice | Administrative fine under Belgian VAT Code |
| Incorrect VAT treatment on invoice | Administrative fine + potential VAT reassessment |
| Failure to archive | Administrative fine |
| Fraud | Criminal penalties under Belgian VAT Code |

### Practical Consequences

- Inability to send/receive Peppol invoices blocks the legal invoicing flow for domestic B2B
- Suppliers who cannot issue structured invoices risk losing business relationships
- Buyers who cannot receive structured invoices violate the mandate by accepting non-compliant documents

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### E-Invoice → VAT Return (BTW-aangifte / Déclaration TVA)

Structured e-invoice data is the primary source for VAT return preparation. From 2028, Belgium anticipates a Peppol five-corner e-reporting model enabling near real-time VAT reporting. This aligns with the EU ViDA (VAT in the Digital Age) initiative.

### Automated Bookkeeping

Peppol BIS invoices in UBL 2.1 XML are machine-readable and can be automatically booked into accounting systems. This enables straight-through processing for accounts payable and accounts receivable.

### Purchase Order Matching

Peppol supports the full procure-to-pay chain. Invoices can reference Peppol order documents (`cac:OrderReference`), enabling automated 3-way matching (order → receipt → invoice).

### Cross-Border Interoperability

Belgium's Peppol-based framework is inherently interoperable with other Peppol-connected countries (Italy, France, Netherlands, Germany, Nordics, etc.). Cross-border invoices between Peppol participants follow the same technical specification.

### Corporate Tax (Vennootschapsbelasting / Impôt des sociétés)

Invoice data from Peppol invoices feeds into corporate tax computations. FPS Finance can cross-reference e-invoice data against reported revenue and deduction claims.
