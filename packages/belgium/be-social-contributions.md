## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

- **Required inputs before computing any social contribution figure** — 1. Social status -- zelfstandige in hoofdberoep (main occupation), bijberoep (secondary occupation), or meewerkende echtgeno(o)t(e) (assisting spouse)? 2. Net professional income -- netto beroepsinkomen from self-employment (after business expenses, before social contributions and personal deductions) 3. Year of activity -- starter (first 3 years) or established? 4. Social insurance fund -- which fund is the client affiliated with? 5. Any concurrent employment? -- determines hoofdberoep vs bijberoep 6. Interest in VAPZ/PLCI? -- supplementary pension for self-employed
- **Stop condition if occupation status unknown** — If main vs secondary occupation status is unknown, STOP. Rates and minimums differ significantly.
- **R-BE-SOC-1 -- Cross-border frontier worker** — Trigger: client lives in Belgium but works as self-employed in another EU state. Message: "Cross-border social insurance requires A1 certificate analysis under EU Regulation 883/2004. Escalate to qualified accountant."  _(R-BE-SOC-1)_
- **R-BE-SOC-2 -- Artistic status** — Trigger: client claims artistic status for social contribution purposes. Message: "Artistic status determination is outside this skill's scope. Refer to qualified accountant with expertise in artist social status."  _(R-BE-SOC-2)_
- **Prohibitions** — NEVER compute contributions without knowing hoofdberoep vs bijberoep status NEVER forget the 3.05% management fee -- it is always added by the social insurance fund NEVER tell a client that social contributions have no upper limit -- there IS a ceiling at EUR 108,238.40 NEVER ignore the minimum contribution for hoofdberoep -- even with zero income, minimum applies NEVER confuse VAPZ deductibility with regular business expense deduction -- they are separate mechanisms NEVER apply bijberoep rates to a client whose employment is below 50% of full-time NEVER state that provisional contributions are final -- regularisation WILL occur NEVER present contribution amounts without noting the management fee component

## Section 3 -- Contribution base

Legislation: KB nr. 38, art. 11

- **How the base is determined** — Provisional contributions are based on income from 3 years ago (N-3), indexed. Final contributions are recalculated when the actual-year income is assessed by the tax administration. Social contributions are themselves deductible from taxable income, creating a circular reference resolved by RSVZ tables.  _(KB nr. 38, art. 11)_
- **Contribution base formula** — contribution_base = net_professional_income (netto beroepsinkomen) This is the income from self-employment AFTER business expenses but BEFORE social contributions deduction.  _(KB nr. 38, art. 11)_

## Section 4 -- Rates and thresholds (2025)

Legislation: KB nr. 38, art. 12; RSVZ published rates

### Hoofdberoep rates

**Hoofdberoep rates**  _(KB nr. 38, art. 12; RSVZ published rates)_

| Income bracket | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| EUR 0 -- EUR 73,447.52 | 20.50% |
| EUR 73,947.41 -- EUR 108,238.40 | 14.16% |
| Above EUR 108,238.40 | 0% |

### Bijberoep

**Bijberoep**  _(KB nr. 38, art. 12; RSVZ published rates)_

| Threshold | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Exemption threshold (no contributions below) | EUR 1,881.75/year |
| Minimum quarterly contribution (above threshold) | EUR 99.38 |
| Rate above threshold | 20.50% (same bracket schedule as hoofdberoep) |

### Minimum contributions -- hoofdberoep

**Minimum contributions -- hoofdberoep**  _(KB nr. 38, art. 12; RSVZ published rates)_

| Category | Quarterly minimum (2025) | Annual minimum |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Established (4+ years) | EUR 871.71 | EUR 3,561.68 |
| Starter (years 1-3) | EUR 871.71 | EUR 3,561.68 |

- **Starter reduction floor** — Starters can request reduction to a lower provisional contribution if they expect low income, but the minimum cannot go below the bijberoep minimum.

### VAPZ / PLCI supplementary pension

Legislation: Wet van 24 december 2002 (VAPZ); Programmawet 2003

**VAPZ / PLCI supplementary pension**  _(Wet van 24 december 2002 (VAPZ); Programmawet 2003)_

| Type | Maximum | Tax treatment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary VAPZ | 8.17% of reference income (max ~EUR 4,000.44) | Deductible as social contribution |
| Social VAPZ | 9.40% of reference income (max ~EUR 4,602.71) | Same + additional solidarity coverage |

- **Reference income (VAPZ)** — Reference income = income from N-3 (same base as social contributions). Must be affiliated with social insurance fund and in order with contribution payments.  _(Wet van 24 december 2002 (VAPZ); Programmawet 2003)_

## Section 5 -- Computation steps

### Step 5.1 -- Determine occupation type

- **Occupation type determination** — IF client has concurrent employment >= 50% of full-time: status = bijberoep ELSE: status = hoofdberoep

### Step 5.2 -- Compute annual contributions (hoofdberoep)

- **Annual contribution computation (hoofdberoep)** — IF income <= 73,447.52: contributions = income x 20.50% ELIF income <= 108,238.40: contributions = (73,447.52 x 20.50%) + ((income - 73,447.52) x 14.16%) ELSE: contributions = (73,447.52 x 20.50%) + ((108,238.40 - 73,447.52) x 14.16%) contributions = max(contributions, annual_minimum) management_fee = contributions x 3.05% total = contributions + management_fee

### Step 5.3 -- Compute quarterly payment

- **Quarterly payment computation** — quarterly_payment = total / 4

### Step 5.4 -- Bijberoep computation

- **Bijberoep computation** — IF income <= 1,865.44: contributions = 0 ELSE: Apply same rate brackets as hoofdberoep contributions = max(calculated_amount, quarterly_minimum x 4)

## Section 6 -- Payment schedule and tax deductibility

Legislation: KB nr. 38, art. 15; WIB art. 52

### Payment schedule

**Payment schedule**  _(KB nr. 38, art. 15; WIB art. 52)_

| Quarter | Covers | Due date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | Jan--Mar | 31 March |
| Q2 | Apr--Jun | 30 June |
| Q3 | Jul--Sep | 30 September |
| Q4 | Oct--Dec | 31 December |

- **Payment fund and penalties** — Contributions are payable to the chosen social insurance fund (sociaal verzekeringsfonds). Late payment triggers a 3% surcharge per quarter plus 7% annual interest. Non-payment can result in loss of social security rights.  _(KB nr. 38, art. 15; WIB art. 52)_

### Tax deductibility

**Tax deductibility**  _(KB nr. 38, art. 15; WIB art. 52)_

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Are social contributions deductible? | YES -- fully deductible as beroepskosten |
| When deductible? | In the year they are paid |
| Does this include regularisation payments? | YES -- deductible in year of payment |
| Are VAPZ contributions also deductible? | YES -- as separate deduction under social contribution rules (not beroepskosten) |

## Section 7 -- Starter status and special situations

### Starter status (first 4 quarters)

- **Starter status rules** — Client can request provisional contributions based on estimated income rather than minimum. Reduced start-up contributions available if expected income is low, minimum = bijberoep minimum. Risk warning: if actual income exceeds estimates, significant regularisation will follow. Adviser should review estimated income and warn about Nachbemessung risk.  _(KB nr. 38, art. 12bis)_

### Management company (vennootschap) mandataris

- **Management company mandataris treatment** — Client is a company director (bestuurder/zaakvoerder) and also has an independent practice: the client pays social contributions as self-employed on total net professional income from ALL self-employed activities. Company director fees (bezoldiging bedrijfsleider) are part of this base. There is no separate contribution regime for mandatarissen.

### Meewerkende echtgeno(o)t(e) (assisting spouse)

- **Assisting spouse statutes** — Mini-statute: contributions limited to sickness/disability. Maxi-statute: full contributions like hoofdberoep on attributed income. Determine which statute applies and flag for reviewer.

### Pensioner continuing self-employment

- **Pensioner continuing self-employment rules** — If the client has reached legal retirement age and has 45-year career, no income limits apply. Otherwise, income limits may apply and excess income triggers contribution obligations. Minimum contribution = bijberoep minimum.

### Student-zelfstandige

- **Student-entrepreneur status** — Specific student-entrepreneur status available since 2017. If income below threshold (approx EUR 8,430.72), reduced contributions apply. Above threshold, regular bijberoep or hoofdberoep rules apply.

## Section 8 -- Edge case registry

### EC1 -- Concurrent employment below 50%

- **EC1 resolution** — Situation: Client is employed part-time (30%) and self-employed. Resolution: If employment is below 50% of full-time, client is considered zelfstandige in hoofdberoep, not bijberoep. Full minimum contributions apply. Verify exact employment percentage with employment contract. Flag for reviewer.

### EC2 -- Income much higher than N-3 base

- **EC2 resolution** — Situation: Client's provisional base from 3 years ago is EUR 20,000 but current year will be EUR 80,000. Resolution: Client can voluntarily increase provisional contributions to avoid large regularisation. Recommend increasing to avoid cash flow shock.

### EC3 -- Regularisation after cessation

- **EC3 resolution** — Situation: Client stopped self-employment in 2023, regularisation for 2023 arrives in 2025. Resolution: Regularisation must be paid even after cessation. The amount is deductible in the year of payment from any remaining income or can reduce personal income tax.

### EC4 -- Cross-border EEA (frontier worker)

- **EC4 resolution** — Situation: Client lives in Belgium but works as self-employed in the Netherlands. Resolution: Under EU Regulation 883/2004, if the client works in multiple member states, they generally pay contributions in their country of residence if they perform substantial (25%+) activity there. A1 certificate required. Escalate to reviewer.  _(EU Regulation 883/2004)_

## Section 9 -- Reviewer escalation protocol

When a situation requires reviewer judgement:

REVIEWER FLAG
