### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether normal management or speculative | Treat as speculative (taxable at 33%) |
| Unknown whether speculative or professional | Treat as professional (progressive rates) |
| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without acquisition cost |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — determines worldwide taxation |
| Crypto > 25% of movable wealth | Strong indicator of speculative/abnormal management per SDA practice |
| Mining/staking activity | Treat as professional income unless clearly de minimis |

---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 The Three-Tier System (Income Year 2025)

Belgium applies a **facts-and-circumstances** classification to determine how crypto gains are taxed. There is no statutory bright-line test. The three tiers are:

| Tier | Dutch | French | Tax Rate | Legal Basis |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Normal management of private patrimony | Normaal beheer van privévermogen / goede huisvader | Gestion normale du patrimoine privé / bon père de famille | **TAX FREE** | Art. 90, al. 1, 1° WIB 92 (exclusion) |
| 2. Speculative gains | Speculatieve meerwaarden | Plus-values spéculatives | **33%** + municipal surcharge (avg. 7–8%) | Art. 90, al. 1, 1° and Art. 171, 1° WIB 92 |
| 3. Professional income | Beroepsinkomen | Revenus professionnels | **25%–50%** progressive + social security | Art. 23 §1 WIB 92 |

### 2.2 Classification Factors (SDA Ruling Practice)

The Dienst Voorafgaande Beslissingen (DVB/SDA) uses a detailed questionnaire to classify crypto investors. Key factors:

| Factor | Normal Management (Tax-Free) | Speculative (33%) | Professional (25–50%) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crypto as % of movable wealth | < 25% (SDA informal threshold) | > 25% | High and systematic |
| Transaction frequency | Low; buy-and-hold | High volume trading | Very high; daily trading |
| Holding period | Long (months to years) | Short (days to weeks) | Very short; day trading |
| Strategy | Passive; long-term appreciation | Active trading; momentum | Full-time activity |
| Leverage / borrowing | None | May use | Regular use |
| Automation / bots | None | Possible | Systematic use |
| Professional knowledge/background | No finance background | Some expertise | Finance/IT professional |
| Mining activity | None | Minor | Regular commercial mining |
| Forum/community participation | Minimal | Active | Influencer/educator |
| Third-party management | None | None | Manages for others |
| Income dependency | Has separate primary income | Has other income | Crypto is primary income |

### 2.3 The 25% Wealth Threshold

The SDA applies an **informal but consistently enforced threshold**: if more than 25% of a taxpayer's movable wealth is invested in cryptocurrency, the SDA quasi-automatically classifies the management as "abnormal" (speculative). This threshold is controversial but well-documented in published rulings.

**Critical note:** The percentage must be tracked from the date of first investment through each year-end. The SDA questionnaire requires a table showing this percentage at each key date.

### 2.4 Advance Rulings (DVB/SDA)

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Who can apply | Any Belgian tax resident (individual) |
| What it provides | Binding advance determination of tax classification |
| Validity | Typically limited to 1 year; contains reservations for legislative changes |
| Cost | Free |
| Processing time | 3–6 months |
| Questionnaire | 17+ questions covering all factors above (updated 2026 for new regime) |
| Binding effect | Binds the tax administration unless facts change or legislation is amended |

**Citation:** Loi du 24 décembre 2002 / Wet van 24 december 2002 (DVB/SDA organic law); DVB/SDA annual reports and published rulings

## Section 3 -- Rate Tables

### 3.1 Tax Rates by Classification (Income Year 2025)

| Classification | Federal Rate | Municipal Surcharge | Effective Rate | Social Security |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Normal management | 0% | N/A | **0%** | No |
| Speculative (miscellaneous income) | 33% | ~7–8% of federal tax | **~35.4–35.6%** | No |
| Professional income bracket 1 | 25% on 0–€16,320 | ~7–8% | ~26.8–27.0% | Yes (~20.5% self-employed) |
| Professional income bracket 2 | 40% on €16,320–€28,800 | ~7–8% | ~42.8–43.2% | Yes |
| Professional income bracket 3 | 45% on €28,800–€49,840 | ~7–8% | ~48.2–48.6% | Yes |
| Professional income bracket 4 | 50% on €49,840+ | ~7–8% | ~53.5–54.0% | Yes |

**Personal tax allowance (belastingvrije som):** EUR 10,910 for income year 2025

**Citation:** Art. 130–145 WIB 92; Art. 171 WIB 92; FOD Financiën "Belastingtarieven — Inkomstenjaar 2025 (Aanslagjaar 2026)"

### 3.2 Staking / Passive Income Classification

The SDA has classified staking rewards as **roerend inkomen** (movable income / income from movable property) under Art. 17 §1 WIB 92, analogous to interest under Art. 19, 1° WIB 92. This implies:

| Income Type | Rate | Withholding |
|---|---|---|
| Staking rewards (interest analogy) | 30% (précompte mobilier / roerende voorheffing) | Self-assessed if no Belgian intermediary |

**Citation:** SDA ruling March 2025; Art. 17, 19, 261–269 WIB 92

### 3.3 Upcoming 2026 Regime (Important Context for 2025 Planning)

From 1 January 2026, a new capital gains tax applies:

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Rate on "normal management" gains | 10% (replaces tax-free treatment) |
| Annual exemption | EUR 10,000 per taxpayer |
| Historical gains exempt | Gains accrued up to 31 December 2025 are exempt if documented |
| Speculative gains | Still taxed at 33% |
| Professional gains | Still taxed at progressive rates |
| Carry-forward of unused exemption | Up to EUR 1,000/year for max 5 years |

**Citation:** Programme law (Programmawet) 2025; Art. 90, al. 1, 9°, c) WIB 92 (new)

---

## Section 4 -- Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 Accepted Methods

Belgium does not prescribe a specific cost basis method for crypto. In practice:

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| FIFO (First In, First Out) | Accepted; most commonly used |
| Average cost | Accepted |
| LIFO (Last In, First Out) | Not standard; may be challenged |
| Specific identification | Accepted if well documented |

### 4.2 Cost Basis Components

The acquisition cost (aanschaffingswaarde) includes:
- Purchase price in EUR at the date of acquisition
- Exchange fees and commissions
- Network/gas fees directly attributable to the purchase
- Bank transfer fees for deposits to exchanges

### 4.3 No Expense Deduction for Speculative Income

**Critical rule:** For gains taxed as miscellaneous income (33%), **no deduction is permitted for expenses** — only the acquisition cost can offset the sale proceeds. This is per Art. 97 WIB 92.

For professional income, normal business expense deductions apply.

---

## Section 5 -- DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrop Treatment

### 5.1 Mining

| Scale | Classification | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Occasional/small scale | Likely miscellaneous income (speculative) | 33% + municipal surcharge |
| Regular/commercial | Professional income | Progressive rates 25%–50% + social security |

The SDA and OATR (Opsporingsdienst) tend to quickly classify mining as professional activity due to its regular, organised nature.

### 5.2 Staking

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| SDA classification (March 2025 ruling) | Movable income (roerend inkomen) — interest analogy |
| Tax rate | 30% (roerende voorheffing rate) |
| Tax point | When rewards are received/accessible |
| Reporting | Separate obligation from capital gains; Part 2 of tax return (roerende inkomsten) |
| Cost basis for future sale | FMV at receipt date |

### 5.3 DeFi Lending

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Depositing crypto into lending protocol | Uncertain — may constitute a disposal or may be treated as a loan |
| Interest received | Likely movable income at 30% (interest analogy) |
| Withdrawing from lending protocol | Uncertain |

**Warning:** There is no specific Belgian guidance on DeFi lending. The SDA has not published rulings on LP positions, yield farming, or DeFi protocols. Conservative approach: treat deposits as disposals.

### 5.4 Liquidity Providing

No specific guidance. Conservative treatment:
- Deposit into LP = disposal of underlying crypto (capital gain/loss triggered)
- LP tokens = new acquisition at FMV
- Withdrawal from LP = disposal of LP tokens

### 5.5 Airdrops

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Gratuitous airdrop | Cost basis EUR 0; taxable event at disposal only |
| Airdrop for service/action | Income at FMV when received; classification depends on overall investor profile |

### 5.6 Hard Forks

No specific guidance. Conservative treatment:
- Cost basis of forked coin = EUR 0
- Gain = full proceeds on disposal
- Classification follows normal three-tier analysis

---

## Section 6 -- NFT Treatment

### 6.1 General NFT Classification

Belgium applies the same three-tier classification to NFTs as to other crypto assets:

| Scenario | Likely Classification |
|---|---|
| Buy and hold NFT art long-term | Normal management (tax-free in 2025) |
| Frequent NFT trading (flipping) | Speculative (33%) |
| NFT creation and sale as regular activity | Professional income (25–50%) |

### 6.2 NFT-Specific Considerations

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| NFT purchased with crypto | Two transactions: disposal of crypto + acquisition of NFT |
| NFT sold for crypto | Disposal of NFT + acquisition of crypto |
| NFT creation (artist) | If regular → professional income |
| NFT royalties | Likely movable income or professional income depending on regularity |

### 6.3 TOB (Tax on Stock Exchange Transactions)

The Taks op de Beursverrichtingen (TOB) / Taxe sur les Opérations de Bourse does **NOT** apply to cryptocurrency or NFT transactions. The TOB is limited to transactions in financial instruments executed through a Belgian intermediary on a regulated market.

**Citation:** Art. 120–123 of the Code of Miscellaneous Taxes and Duties (Wetboek Diverse Rechten en Taksen)

---

## Section 7 -- Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Tax Return Filing

| Classification | Where to Report |
|---|---|
| Normal management (tax-free) | No reporting obligation for gains; but crypto accounts must be declared to CAP (see below) |
| Speculative / miscellaneous income | Part 2 of tax return, Section XV — Diverse inkomsten / Revenus divers (Code 1440/2440) |
| Professional income | Part 1 of tax return — Beroepsinkomsten / Revenus professionnels |
| Staking rewards (movable income) | Part 2 — Roerende inkomsten / Revenus mobiliers |

### 7.2 Centraal Aanspreekpunt (CAP) — Foreign Account Declaration

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| What must be declared | Foreign crypto exchange accounts (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, etc.) |
| To whom | National Bank of Belgium — Centraal Aanspreekpunt (CAP) |
| Deadline | Before filing the tax return |
| Penalty for non-declaration | Fines and potential criminal prosecution |
| Belgian exchanges | Not required (domestic accounts) |

### 7.3 Filing Deadlines (Income Year 2025)

| Method | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Paper filing | Late June 2026 (exact date published annually) |
| Tax-on-web (e-filing) | Mid-July 2026 (exact date published annually) |
| Via tax advisor (mandataris) | Late October 2026 |

### 7.4 Record-Keeping

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 7 years from the assessment year |
| Records to maintain | Full transaction logs, cost basis calculations, portfolio value at each year-end, documentation of crypto-to-movable-wealth ratio |
| SDA ruling documentation | Keep the SDA questionnaire responses and ruling decision indefinitely |
| Burden of proof | On taxpayer for normal management claim; on administration for professional reclassification |

### 7.5 DAC8 / CARF (From 2026)

- Crypto service providers report Belgian user transaction data to FOD Financiën
- Increased audit risk for undeclared crypto gains
- Belgian tax authorities have been increasingly auditing crypto holders since 2023

---

## Section 8 -- Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

### 8.1 Loss Rules by Classification

| Classification | Loss Offset | Carry-Forward |
|---|---|---|
| Normal management | N/A (gains are tax-free, so losses are irrelevant) | No |
| Speculative (miscellaneous income) | Losses can **only** offset gains within the **same category** (miscellaneous/speculative crypto gains) in the **same tax year** | **No carry-forward** |
| Professional income | Losses deductible as business losses; can offset other professional income | Carry-forward possible under normal business loss rules |

### 8.2 Critical Limitation — Speculative Losses

**Speculative crypto losses CANNOT offset:**
- Employment income
- Rental income
- Movable income (dividends, interest)
- Other types of miscellaneous income not in the same sub-category

This is one of the harshest aspects of Belgian crypto taxation.

**Citation:** Art. 90 and Art. 103 WIB 92

### 8.3 2026 Regime — Loss Rules

Under the new 10% capital gains tax from 2026:
- Losses are deductible only against gains in the **same sub-category** of financial assets
- Crypto losses cannot offset, e.g., share gains
- No carry-forward of losses

---

## Section 9 -- Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 General Anti-Abuse Provision

Belgium has a general anti-abuse provision (Art. 344, §1 WIB 92) that allows the tax administration to recharacterise transactions lacking genuine economic substance. This includes artificial structures designed to avoid crypto taxation.

### 9.2 Substance Over Form

The SDA and courts apply a substance-over-form analysis. Even if a taxpayer formally holds crypto long-term, the overall pattern of behaviour determines classification. Key case law precedents include the Court of Cassation rulings of 1968/1969 defining professional vs private activities.

### 9.3 Increased Audit Activity

Belgian tax authorities have significantly increased crypto-related audits since 2023. Common triggers:
- Large bank deposits from crypto exchange withdrawals
- Inconsistencies between declared income and lifestyle
- Information received from foreign tax authorities
- DAC8/CARF reports (from 2026)
- Undeclared CAP accounts

### 9.4 Penalties

| Offence | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Late filing | Administrative fines (EUR 50–1,250) |
| Undeclared crypto income | Tax surcharge of 10%–200% of unpaid tax |
| Undeclared foreign accounts (CAP) | Separate fines; potential criminal prosecution |
| Fraud | Criminal penalties; tax surcharge up to 200% |

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Normal Management (Tax-Free in 2025)

**Input:** Belgian resident, employed engineer. Bought 2 BTC in January 2023 at EUR 20,000 each. Sold 2 BTC in November 2025 at EUR 55,000 each. Total 3 trades in 3 years. Crypto represents 15% of movable wealth. No leverage, no bots, no mining.

**Classification analysis:**
```
Factors:
  - Low frequency: 1 buy + 1 sell in 3 years                → Normal management
  - Long holding period: ~34 months                          → Normal management
  - Crypto < 25% of movable wealth (15%)                    → Normal management
  - No leverage, no automation                               → Normal management
  - Employed separately; crypto not primary income            → Normal management
  - Passive buy-and-hold strategy                            → Normal management

Classification: Normal management of private patrimony

Gain:  2 × (EUR 55,000 - EUR 20,000) = EUR 70,000
Tax:   EUR 0 (tax-free under normal management)
```

**Recommendation:** Obtain an SDA ruling to confirm classification, especially given the significant gain amount.

### Example 2 -- Speculative Gains (33%)

**Input:** Belgian resident. Made 150+ trades in 2025 across 4 exchanges. Mix of short-term and medium-term positions. Crypto represents 40% of movable wealth. Net gain of EUR 25,000 after costs. No leverage but uses portfolio tracking tools actively.

**Classification analysis:**
```
Factors:
  - High frequency: 150+ trades                             → Speculative
  - Crypto > 25% threshold (40%)                            → Speculative (SDA quasi-automatic)
  - Mix of holding periods                                   → Speculative
  - Active management with tools                             → Speculative
  - Not full-time; has other employment                      → Not professional

Classification: Speculative — miscellaneous income (Art. 90, 1° WIB 92)

Gain:           EUR 25,000
Federal tax:    EUR 25,000 × 33% = EUR 8,250
Municipal surcharge (assume 7.5%): EUR 8,250 × 7.5% = EUR 618.75
Total tax:      EUR 8,868.75

Reporting: Part 2, Section XV — Diverse inkomsten (Code 1440)
```

### Example 3 -- Professional Income

**Input:** Belgian resident, no other employment. Full-time crypto trader. 1,000+ trades in 2025. Uses leverage and automated bots. Manages a small fund for friends. Net income EUR 80,000.

**Classification analysis:**
```
Factors:
  - Very high frequency: 1,000+ trades                      → Professional
  - Full-time activity; primary income source                → Professional
  - Leverage and automation                                  → Professional
  - Manages for third parties                                → Professional

Classification: Professional income (Art. 23, §1 WIB 92)

Taxable income: EUR 80,000
Personal allowance: EUR 10,910 (tax-free)
Remaining: EUR 69,090

Tax computation:
  EUR 16,320 × 25%              = EUR 4,080.00
  (EUR 28,800 - EUR 16,320) × 40% = EUR 4,992.00
  (EUR 49,840 - EUR 28,800) × 45% = EUR 9,468.00
  (EUR 69,090 - EUR 49,840) × 50% = EUR 9,625.00
  Subtotal:                        EUR 28,165.00
  Less personal allowance credit:  EUR 10,910 × 25% = EUR -2,727.50
  Federal tax:                     EUR 25,437.50
  Municipal surcharge (7.5%):      EUR 1,907.81
  Total income tax:                EUR 27,345.31
  Social security (~20.5%):        EUR 80,000 × 20.5% = EUR 16,400.00
  TOTAL TAX BURDEN:                EUR 43,745.31 (~54.7%)

Reporting: Part 1 — Beroepsinkomsten / Revenus professionnels
```

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER assume all crypto gains are tax-free in Belgium — only "normal management" gains are exempt (and only for 2025; 10% from 2026)
- NEVER rely solely on holding period to determine classification — the SDA considers multiple factors holistically
- NEVER ignore the 25% movable wealth threshold — it is the most heavily weighted factor in SDA practice
- NEVER offset speculative crypto losses against employment or other income — they are ring-fenced
- NEVER forget to declare foreign exchange accounts to the CAP (National Bank)
- NEVER treat mining as normal management — the SDA/OATR considers mining inherently professional or speculative
- NEVER ignore municipal surcharges when computing tax — they add ~7–8% to the federal rate
- NEVER present a single ruling as universally applicable — each SDA ruling is specific to the taxpayer's facts
- NEVER compute gains without verified cost basis records
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
