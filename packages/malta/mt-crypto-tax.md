### DLT Asset Classification (CfR Guidelines)

| Asset Type | CfR Definition | Capital Gains Tax (Art. 5) | Income Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| Coins (cryptocurrencies) | Medium of exchange / store of value (e.g. BTC, ETH, LTC) | NOT subject to CGT | Trading profits = ordinary income; investment gains generally not taxed |
| Utility Tokens | Access to a product/service on a DLT platform | NOT subject to CGT | Trading profits = ordinary income |
| Financial Tokens (securities) | Participate in profits, mimic shares/bonds/units in CIS | Subject to CGT if they meet "securities" definition under Art. 5 | Trading profits = ordinary income |
| Hybrid / Convertible Tokens | Start as utility, convert to financial token | Outside CGT until converted to securities | Trading profits = ordinary income |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether trading or investment | Treat as trading (taxable as ordinary income) |
| Unknown token classification | Treat as coin (not subject to CGT, but trading profits taxable) |
| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without acquisition cost |
| Unknown residency / domicile | STOP — affects source and remittance rules |
| Unknown whether activity is commercial mining | Treat as commercial (taxable) |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- transaction history from exchange(s) or wallet(s), confirmation of residency and domicile status, and indication of whether activity is trading or long-term investment.

**Recommended** -- full CSV exports from all exchanges used (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Revolut, etc.), wallet addresses with on-chain history, cost basis records for each acquisition, and record of any staking/lending/mining activity.

**Ideal** -- complete portfolio tracker export (e.g. CoinTracking, Koinly, Accointing), DeFi protocol interaction history, NFT purchase/sale records, and documentation of any token airdrops received.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-MTC-1 -- Residency/domicile unknown.** "Malta's crypto tax treatment depends critically on residency and domicile status. Non-domiciled residents are only taxed on foreign-source income remitted to Malta. Cannot proceed without this information."

**R-MTC-2 -- No transaction records.** "Crypto tax computations require detailed transaction records with dates, amounts, and counterparties. Without exchange/wallet records, gains cannot be calculated. Cannot proceed."

**R-MTC-3 -- ICO/STO issuance.** "Token issuance (ICOs, STOs, IEOs) has complex tax implications for the issuer including potential VAT, income tax, and regulatory obligations. Escalate to a warranted accountant with MFSA expertise."

**R-MTC-4 -- Corporate crypto holdings.** "Companies holding crypto on their balance sheet have different accounting and tax treatment. This skill covers individuals only. Escalate to a warranted accountant."

**R-MTC-5 -- Cross-border DeFi structures.** "Complex DeFi arrangements involving multiple jurisdictions, DAOs, or liquidity pool governance tokens require specialist international tax advice. Escalate."

---

## Section 3 -- Computation Rules

### 3.1 Coins (BTC, ETH, etc.) -- Tax Treatment

**Key principle:** Coins are treated analogously to foreign currency. They are NOT securities under Article 5 ITA.

| Scenario | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Held as trading stock (frequent buy/sell for profit) | Profits are **ordinary income**, taxed at progressive rates (0%--35%) |
| Held as long-term investment (buy and hold) | Gains on disposal generally **NOT taxable** (not within CGT scope, not trading income) |
| Mining — private scale | Income at market value when received; if sold within short period, practical approach: taxable as other income |
| Mining — commercial scale | Business income, taxed as self-employment |
| Staking rewards | Income at market value when received (sonstige Einkünfte equivalent) |
| Airdrops | Taxable as income if received in exchange for a service; gratuitous airdrops may not be taxable |
| Payment for goods/services | Disposal at market value — gain is trading income or not taxable depending on classification |

### 3.2 Trading vs Investment -- The Critical Distinction

The CfR applies general income tax principles. There is no statutory bright-line test. Factors indicating **trading**:

| Factor | Indicates Trading |
|---|---|
| Frequency of transactions | High volume, multiple trades per day/week |
| Holding period | Short (days to weeks) |
| Intent | Profit from short-term price movements |
| Sophistication | Use of leverage, derivatives, automated bots |
| Funding | Borrowed money to fund purchases |
| Organisation | Systematic, business-like approach |

Factors indicating **investment**:

| Factor | Indicates Investment |
|---|---|
| Frequency | Infrequent, buy-and-hold |
| Holding period | Long (months to years) |
| Intent | Long-term capital appreciation |
| Funding | Own savings |
| Other income | Has separate primary employment |

**Conservative default:** If classification is unclear, treat as trading (fully taxable).

### 3.3 Financial Tokens (Security Tokens)

If a token meets the definition of "securities" under Article 5 ITA (participates in company profits, return not limited to fixed rate, or units in a CIS), then:

- Transfer is subject to **capital gains tax** under Article 5
- Capital gains rate: generally 0% for transfers of securities listed on a recognised exchange, or taxed at progressive rates for unlisted securities depending on the nature of the underlying
- Losses on securities within the CGT regime can only offset gains within that regime

### 3.4 Cost Basis and Methods

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| FIFO (First In, First Out) | Accepted by CfR; recommended |
| Specific identification | Acceptable if clearly documented |
| Average cost | May be accepted; less common |
| LIFO | Not standard practice in Malta |

The cost basis includes:
- Purchase price in EUR (convert at exchange rate on date of acquisition)
- Exchange fees and commissions paid on acquisition
- Network/gas fees directly attributable to the transaction

### 3.5 Non-Domiciled Residents (Special Rules)

Malta's remittance basis for non-domiciled residents is critical for crypto:

| Scenario | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Malta-domiciled resident | Worldwide crypto income taxable |
| Malta-resident but NOT Malta-domiciled | Foreign-source crypto income taxable ONLY if remitted to Malta |
| Crypto gains kept on foreign exchange (not remitted) | NOT taxable for non-doms (if source is foreign) |
| Proceeds transferred to Malta bank account | Taxable for non-doms (remittance) |
| Minimum tax for non-doms | EUR 5,000 per year (regardless of actual remittance) |

---

## Section 4 -- VAT Treatment

### 4.1 Crypto and VAT

| Transaction | VAT Treatment | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Exchange of crypto for fiat (and vice versa) | Exempt financial service (no VAT) | CJEU C-264/14 Hedqvist |
| Payment for goods/services using crypto | VAT applies to the underlying supply (not the crypto itself) | Standard EU VAT rules |
| Crypto exchange platform services | Exempt financial service | CJEU Hedqvist |
| Mining rewards (no identifiable recipient) | Outside scope of VAT (no supply) | General VAT principles |
| Mining as a service (identifiable recipient) | Subject to VAT at 18% | Service supply |
| NFT sale (digital art/collectible) | Subject to VAT at 18% (electronically supplied service) | EU VAT rules on digital services |
| Staking-as-a-service | Likely exempt financial service; case-by-case | CfR position evolving |

---

## Section 5 -- Transaction Pattern Library

### 5.1 Income Patterns (Credits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BINANCE WITHDRAWAL, BINANCE DEPOSIT (to bank) | Potential disposal proceeds | Convert EUR amount on date; match to cost basis |
| COINBASE PAYOUT, COINBASE EUR | Potential disposal proceeds | Match to trades on Coinbase |
| REVOLUT CRYPTO SELL, REVOLUT EXCHANGE | Disposal proceeds | Revolut provides transaction history in-app |
| KRAKEN WITHDRAWAL | Potential disposal proceeds | Match to Kraken trade history |
| MINING REWARD, POOL PAYOUT, ETHERMINE | Mining income | Taxable at market value on receipt date |
| STAKING REWARD, VALIDATOR REWARD | Staking income | Taxable at market value on receipt date |
| AIRDROP, TOKEN DISTRIBUTION | Possible income | Taxable if received for a service; potentially not if gratuitous |
| P2P TRANSFER, BISQ, LOCALBITCOINS | Potential disposal | Verify whether sale or transfer between own wallets |

### 5.2 Expense Patterns (Debits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BINANCE DEPOSIT, COINBASE BUY, REVOLUT CRYPTO BUY | Acquisition cost | Record as cost basis for FIFO |
| GAS FEE, NETWORK FEE, TRANSACTION FEE | Part of cost basis | Add to acquisition cost of the asset obtained |
| EXCHANGE FEE, TRADING FEE, COMMISSION | Part of cost basis or disposal cost | Deductible from gain computation |
| HARDWARE WALLET, LEDGER, TREZOR | Business expense if trading | Capital item if trading business; not deductible if personal investment |

### 5.3 Exclusions

| Pattern | Treatment |
|---|---|
| TRANSFER BETWEEN OWN WALLETS | EXCLUDE — not a disposal |
| EXCHANGE TO EXCHANGE TRANSFER (same owner) | EXCLUDE — not a disposal |
| WRAPPING/UNWRAPPING (e.g. ETH → WETH) | Generally EXCLUDE — no change in economic ownership |
| STABLECOIN CONVERSION (EUR equivalent) | Technically a disposal — but gain is typically zero or negligible |

## Section 6 -- MFSA Regulatory Framework (Non-Tax)

The MFSA regulatory framework is distinct from tax but relevant for context:

| Framework | Scope | Tax Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| Virtual Financial Assets Act (VFAA, Chapter 590) | Licensing of VFA service providers, ICO rules | Regulatory compliance does not affect tax classification |
| Innovative Technology Arrangements Act (ITAA, Chapter 592) | Certification of DLT platforms | No direct tax impact |
| MiCA (EU Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation) | EU-wide crypto regulation from 2024/2025 | Standardises classification; may influence future CfR guidance |
| DAC8 / CARF | Automatic exchange of crypto transaction data | Exchanges report to CfR from 2026; foreign holdings >EUR 5,000 must be declared |

---

## Section 7 -- Record-Keeping Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 6 years from end of relevant tax year |
| Records to maintain | Full transaction logs from all exchanges, wallet addresses, cost basis calculations, FIFO ledger, staking/mining logs |
| Format | CSV exports preferred; screenshots acceptable as backup; on-chain records (block explorer links) recommended |
| Burden of proof | On the taxpayer — CfR can request records; DAC8 data will allow cross-referencing |

---

## Section 8 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Trader, Coins, Ordinary Income

**Input:** Malta-domiciled resident. Bought 1 BTC at EUR 25,000 in January 2025. Sold 1 BTC at EUR 45,000 in March 2025. Traded frequently (50+ trades in year). Exchange fees: EUR 100 total.

**Computation:**
```
Disposal proceeds:  EUR 45,000
Cost basis:         EUR 25,000 + EUR 100 fees = EUR 25,100
Gain:               EUR 19,900
Classification:     Trading income (frequent trader)
Tax:                Ordinary income at progressive rates
```
If single, no other income: tax on EUR 19,900 = EUR 0 (first 9,100) + EUR 810 (9,101-14,500 @ 15%) + EUR 1,350 (14,501-19,500 @ 25%) + EUR 100 (19,501-19,900 @ 25%) = EUR 2,260.

### Example 2 -- Investor, Coins, Not Taxable

**Input:** Malta-domiciled resident. Bought 2 ETH at EUR 1,500 each in 2021. Sold 2 ETH at EUR 3,500 each in 2025. Total 3 trades in 4 years. Employed full-time separately.

**Computation:**
```
Gain: (EUR 3,500 - EUR 1,500) × 2 = EUR 4,000
Classification: Investment (infrequent, long hold, employed elsewhere)
Tax: NOT taxable — coins held as investment are outside CGT scope
```
Flag for reviewer: confirm investment classification based on full trading history.

### Example 3 -- Non-Dom, Foreign Exchange, Not Remitted

**Input:** Malta-resident, non-domiciled individual. Traded crypto on Binance (non-Malta platform). EUR 30,000 gain. Proceeds remain on Binance, not transferred to Malta bank.

**Computation:**
```
Gain: EUR 30,000
Source: Foreign (traded on foreign platform)
Remitted to Malta: No
Tax: NOT taxable (remittance basis — foreign gains not remitted)
Minimum tax: EUR 5,000 still applies regardless
```

### Example 4 -- Staking Income

**Input:** Malta-domiciled resident. Staked ETH via Coinbase. Received 0.5 ETH in staking rewards over 2025. Market value at receipt: EUR 1,750 total.

**Computation:**
```
Staking income: EUR 1,750 (market value at each receipt date)
Classification: Other income (income at receipt)
Tax: Taxable at progressive rates, added to other income
Cost basis of staked ETH received: EUR 1,750 (for future disposal)
```

## Section 9 -- Edge Cases

### 9.1 Hard Forks

When a blockchain forks and the holder receives new coins (e.g. BTC → BCH), the CfR has not issued specific guidance. Conservative treatment:
- Cost basis of original coin: unchanged
- Cost basis of forked coin: EUR 0 (no acquisition cost)
- If sold: full proceeds are gain; classify as trading or investment per normal rules

### 9.2 DeFi Lending / Liquidity Providing

- Interest received from lending (e.g. Aave, Compound): taxable as income at market value when received
- Liquidity provision (e.g. Uniswap): adding to a pool may constitute a disposal; LP tokens received have a new cost basis
- Impermanent loss: not currently a recognised deductible loss under CfR guidance
- Flag for reviewer — DeFi treatment is evolving

### 9.3 NFTs

- Purchase of NFT: acquisition cost for future disposal
- Sale of NFT: disposal — gain taxed as trading income or not taxable depending on frequency
- Creation and sale of NFT (artist/creator): business income
- VAT: electronically supplied service — 18% VAT may apply on B2C sales to EU customers

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER assume all crypto gains are tax-free in Malta — trading profits are taxable as ordinary income
- NEVER classify coins as securities — they fall outside Article 5 CGT
- NEVER ignore the trading vs investment distinction — it determines taxability
- NEVER forget the non-dom remittance basis — it can eliminate Malta tax on unrepatriated foreign gains
- NEVER treat transfers between own wallets as disposals
- NEVER compute gains without verified cost basis and FIFO records
- NEVER advise on MFSA regulatory licensing — this skill covers tax only
- NEVER ignore DAC8 reporting obligations from 2026
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
