| Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) | Transactional profit |

## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

Malta does not currently have formal safe harbour provisions for transfer pricing.

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| Low-value intra-group services | OECD Chapter VII simplified approach (5% cost-plus) may be accepted but is not a statutory safe harbour |
| Interest rates | No safe harbour; arm's length rate must be demonstrated |
| Routine services | No simplified pricing rule; standard TP analysis required |
| SME exemption | SMEs (per EU State Aid Rules) are entirely outside scope of the TP Rules |
| De minimis | Transactions below EUR 6m revenue / EUR 20m capital thresholds: no documentation required but arm's length must still be applied |

### 8.1 SME Exclusion as Practical Relief

The exclusion of SMEs from the scope of S.L. 123.207 provides significant practical relief for Malta's predominantly SME economy. SME definitions follow EU State Aid Rules:
- Fewer than 250 employees
- Annual turnover ≤ EUR 50 million OR balance sheet total ≤ EUR 43 million
- Not more than 25% owned by non-SME entities
