## Section 3 -- Revenue Recognition

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Default under GAPSME** | Accruals basis — revenue recognised when earned, not when cash received |
| **Sole traders (TA24)** | Tax return uses accruals basis; however CFR accepts cash basis for very small operations if consistently applied |
| **Article 10 VAT-registered** | Record revenue net of 18% VAT; VAT goes to 2140 |
| **Article 11 (exempt)** | Record revenue gross — no VAT component |
| **Advance payments received** | Credit to 2130 (Accruals) until service delivered, then transfer to 4000 |
| **Multi-period contracts** | Recognise revenue proportionally over the service period |
| **Bad debts** | Write off to 6600 only when irrecoverable; reverse the original revenue if not yet reported |

---

## Section 4 -- Expense Classification

| Expense Type | Nominal Code | Tax Deductibility | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Office rent | 6000 | Fully deductible | Dedicated business premises |
| Home office utilities | 6020 | Proportional (dedicated room %) | Default 0% until confirmed |
| Motor vehicle costs | 6330/6340 | Business % only | Mileage log required |
| Entertainment | 6700 | NOT deductible | Blocked under Article 14 ITA |
| Software subscriptions | 6410 | Fully deductible | Recurring SaaS under EUR 1,160 |
| Professional fees | 6200/6210 | Fully deductible | Accountant, lawyer (business) |
| Travel (business) | 6310/6320 | Fully deductible | Wholly business purpose |
| Training and CPD | 6420 | Fully deductible | Must relate to current business |
| SSC Class 2 | 6120 | Deductible (Box 20) | NOT in Box 2 of TA24 |
| Fines and penalties | — | NOT deductible | Do not record as business expense |
| Personal drawings | 3300 | NOT deductible | Equity movement, not expense |

---

## Section 5 -- Asset vs Expense Thresholds

| Rule | Threshold | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **Tax depreciation (capital allowances)** | No statutory minimum — all business assets must be depreciated per 6th Schedule | Straight-line over minimum years |
| **VAT Capital Goods Scheme** | EUR 1,160 gross | Separate system; affects VAT Box 30 only |
| **Practical low-value expensing** | Some practitioners expense items under ~EUR 700 immediately | Flag for reviewer; strictly all assets should be depreciated |

### Depreciation Rates (Income Tax Act, 6th Schedule)

| Asset Category | Minimum Years | Annual Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Computers and electronic equipment | 4 | 25% |
| Computer software | 4 | 25% |
| Motor vehicles | 5 | 20% |
| Plant and machinery | 5 | 20% |
| Office equipment | 5 | 20% |
| Air conditioning | 6 | ~17% |
| Furniture, fixtures, fittings | 10 | 10% |
| Electrical/plumbing installations | 15 | ~7% |
| Industrial buildings | 50 | 2% |

Depreciation is straight-line on cost. First-year depreciation starts in the year the asset is first used in business. Industrial buildings qualify for an additional 10% initial allowance in the acquisition year.

---

## Section 6 -- Profit and Loss Format

GAPSME requires an income statement with the following minimum structure:

```
INCOME STATEMENT
For the year ended [date]

Revenue                                          xxx
Cost of sales                                   (xxx)
                                                -----
GROSS PROFIT                                     xxx

Other operating income                           xxx
Administrative expenses                         (xxx)
Distribution costs                              (xxx)
Other operating expenses                        (xxx)
                                                -----
OPERATING PROFIT                                 xxx

                                                -----
PROFIT BEFORE TAX                                xxx

Income tax expense                              (xxx)
                                                -----
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR                              xxx
```

Small entities under GAPSME may combine administrative and distribution costs into a single "operating expenses" line.

## Section 9 -- Micro-Entity / Small Business Simplifications

### GAPSME Size Thresholds (must meet 2 of 3 for two consecutive years)

| Criterion | Small | Medium |
|---|---|---|
| Balance sheet total | ≤ EUR 4,000,000 | ≤ EUR 20,000,000 |
| Revenue | ≤ EUR 8,000,000 | ≤ EUR 40,000,000 |

### Simplifications by Entity Size

| Requirement | Small Entity | Medium Entity |

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

| Tax Skill | How Bookkeeping Connects |
|---|---|
| **malta-income-tax** | P&L profit feeds TA24 Box 3 (net profit). Depreciation per 6th Schedule goes to Box 15. SSC Class 2 goes to Box 20 (not operating expenses for tax). Entertainment in 6700 must be added back. |
| **malta-vat-return** | VAT accounts (1240, 2140, 2150) feed the VAT return. Article 10 entities: output VAT (Box 1) from 2140; input VAT (Box 6) from 1240. Reconcile VAT control (2150) quarterly. |
| **malta-ssc** | SSC Class 2 payments recorded in 6120 feed TA24 Box 20. Employer Class 1 contributions in 6110 are a deductible operating expense in Box 2. |
| **mt-estimated-tax** | Provisional tax payments recorded in 8020 feed TA24 Box 36 as credits against the final tax liability. |
