## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

Spain has very limited safe harbour provisions:

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| Professional partnerships (Art. 18.6 CITL) | Safe harbour where ≥75% of income allocated to partners, subject to conditions (company has resources; >75% from professional activities) |
| Low-value intra-group services | No formal safe harbour; 5% cost-plus benchmark approach may be applied but doesn't exempt from analysis |
| General transactions | No safe harbour; all must be at arm's length with supporting analysis |
| Interest rates | No safe harbour; arm's length market rate must be demonstrated |

### 8.1 Professional Partnerships Safe Harbour (Art. 18.6)

This is Spain's only formal safe harbour:
- Entity allocates ≥75% of income to professional partners
- Entity has human and material resources to carry out the work
- More than 75% of income comes from professional activities
- When conditions met: transaction deemed valued at market value without further analysis required

### 8.2 No General Safe Harbours

Spain explicitly does not publish TP safe harbours, norms, or deemed margins. AEAT insists on case-by-case arm's length analysis based on facts and circumstances. Secret comparables are not permitted.
