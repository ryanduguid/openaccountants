### Core Principle

Modelo 111 is the quarterly declaration used by businesses, professionals, and entities that WITHHOLD IRPF (retenciones) from payments made to:
- Employed workers (rendimientos del trabajo)
- Professionals / freelancers (rendimientos de actividades profesionales)
- Prize winners (premios)
- Certain other categories

This skill focuses on **retenciones on professional services** (pagos a profesionales), which is the most common scenario for small businesses and autónomos paying other autónomos.

### Standard Withholding Rates (2025)

| Category | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Professional services (standard) | 15% | General rate for payments to autónomos/professionals |
| New professionals (first 3 years) | 7% | First 3 fiscal years of activity (must communicate to payer) |
| Training courses / conferences | 15% | Payments to speakers, trainers |
| Intellectual property (author, non-habitual) | 15% | Rights exploitation |
| Industrial property | 15% | Patent/trademark licensing |
| Agricultural/livestock (general) | 2% | Módulos estimación objetiva |
| Agricultural/livestock (engorde) | 1% | Fattening activities |
| Directors / board members (administradores) | 35% | Standard for board fees |
| Directors (entity < €100K turnover) | 19% | Reduced for small entities |

### Filing Calendar (2025)

| Modelo 190 | Annual summary (all recipients) | January 1-31 of following year |
| Certificado de retenciones | Certificate issued to each professional | Before February 1 of following year |
| Modelo 130 | Quarterly estimated payment by professional (pago fraccionado) | Same quarterly dates |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether professional qualifies for 7% | Apply 15% (standard rate) |
| Unknown whether payer must withhold | If payer is a business/professional making payment to another professional for services -- must withhold |
| Unknown whether to file negative Modelo 111 | File with zero amount (declaración negativa) if registered but no payments in quarter |

## Section 2 -- Who Must Withhold (Obligados a Retener)

### 2.1 Entities That Must Withhold

| Payer Type | Must Withhold? |
|---|---|
| Sociedades (SL, SA) | Yes -- always |
| Autónomos / professionals (individual) | Yes -- when paying other professionals for services |
| Public administration | Yes |
| Comunidades de propietarios (if paying professionals) | Yes |
| Individuals (not in economic activity) paying professionals | NO -- private individuals do not withhold |
| Foreign entities without permanent establishment in Spain | Generally NO (unless PE exists) |

### 2.2 Payments Subject to Withholding

| Payment Type | Withholding? | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Invoice from professional autónomo (abogado, consultor, diseñador, etc.) | Yes | 15% (or 7% if new) |
| Invoice from SL/SA (company) | NO -- companies do not have retenciones on services (they pay Impuesto de Sociedades) |
| Invoice for goods (not services) | NO |
| Invoice from agricultural module regime | Yes | 2% (or 1%) |
| Board member fees (administrador) | Yes | 35% (or 19%) |
| Salary to employees | Yes | Variable IRPF rate per employee (calculated per tables) |

### 2.3 How Withholding Works on a Professional Invoice

A professional's invoice includes:

```
Base imponible (fee):              €1,000.00
IVA (21%):                         +€210.00
Retención IRPF (15%):             -€150.00
───────────────────────────────────────────
Total a pagar:                     €1,060.00
```

The payer:
1. Pays the professional €1,060.00
2. Retains €150.00 (which they must deposit to AEAT via Modelo 111)
3. The professional declares the full €1,000 as income and credits the €150 retained against their annual IRPF

## Section 3 -- The 7% Reduced Rate (New Professionals)

| Condition | Requirement |

| Communication | Professional must communicate in writing to the payer that they qualify for 7% |
| Verification | Payer is entitled to rely on the professional's written communication |

### 3.2 Communication Requirements

The professional must provide a signed document (comunicación) stating:
- Full name and NIF/NIE
- Statement that they are in the first 3 fiscal years of activity (alta in IAE)
- Date of alta (start of activity)

If no communication is received, the payer must apply 15%.

## Section 6 -- Interaction with Modelo 130 (Pago Fraccionado)

### 6.1 What is Modelo 130?

Modelo 130 is the professional's own quarterly estimated tax payment. The professional reports:
- Gross income from activities (accumulated in the year)
- Deductible expenses (accumulated)
- Net income × 20% = tax due
- Less: retenciones already withheld by clients (from Modelo 111)
- Less: prior quarters' Modelo 130 payments
- = Amount to pay (or zero)

### 6.2 Exemption from Modelo 130

A professional is EXEMPT from filing Modelo 130 if at least 70% of their income from the prior year was subject to withholding (retención). This is common for professionals who invoice mainly to companies.

### 6.3 Credit Mechanism

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| 1 | Payer withholds 15% and deposits via Modelo 111 |
| 2 | Professional claims withheld amounts as credit in annual IRPF return (Modelo 100) |
| 3 | If quarterly Modelo 130 payments + retenciones withheld > final IRPF liability → refund |

## Section 7 -- Certificado de Retenciones

### 7.1 Obligation

Every payer (retenedor) must issue a certificado de retenciones to each professional before February 1 of the following year. This certificate shows:

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Payer details | Name, NIF, address |
| Recipient details | Name, NIF |
| Tax year | Year covered |
| Total payments | Sum of base amounts paid |
| Total retenciones | Sum of amounts withheld |
| Breakdown | By type if applicable |

### 7.2 Use by Professional

The professional uses the certificado to:
- Verify amounts withheld match their records
- Include in annual Modelo 100 (IRPF return) as tax credits
- Support any discrepancy claims with AEAT

---

## Section 8 -- Edge Cases

### 8.1 Mixed Invoice (Goods + Services)
If a single invoice includes both goods (no retención) and professional services (retención), withholding applies ONLY to the services portion. Must be clearly separated on the invoice.

### 8.2 Professional SL (Sociedad Profesional)
When a Sociedad Limitada Profesional (SLP) renders professional services, retención may apply if the activity is listed in Section 2/3 of the IAE (actividades profesionales). Regular SLs providing services are generally NOT subject to retención.

### 8.3 Non-Resident Professional
Payments to non-resident professionals: withhold at 24% (or treaty rate) under IRNR. File on Modelo 216 (not 111). Treaty may reduce/eliminate.

### 8.4 No Activity in Quarter
If registered as retenedor but made no payments subject to withholding in a quarter: file declaración negativa (Modelo 111 with all zeros). Failure to file may trigger penalty.

### 8.5 Late Filing Penalties

| Situation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Filed late, no AEAT notification | 1% surcharge + 1% per month (up to 12 months); 15%+ after 12 months |
| Filed after AEAT notification (requerimiento) | 5%/10%/15%/20% depending on delay |
| Omission of withholding | 150% of amount not withheld (sanción grave) |

## Section 9 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply 7% rate without written communication from the professional confirming eligibility
- NEVER withhold on invoices from Sociedades Limitadas (SL) for regular services -- only professional partnerships or specific cases
