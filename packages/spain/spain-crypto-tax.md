### Crypto Classification Under IRPF

| Activity | IRPF Classification | Tax Base |
|---|---|---|
| Buying/selling crypto for fiat | Ganancia/pérdida patrimonial (capital gain/loss) | Base del ahorro (savings) |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap (permuta) | Ganancia/pérdida patrimonial | Base del ahorro (savings) |
| Staking / lending / yield farming rewards | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario | Base del ahorro (savings) |
| Airdrops (no service rendered) | Ganancia patrimonial no derivada de transmisión | Base general (general base) |
| Mining — occasional | Ganancia patrimonial | Base general (general base) |
| Mining / trading — habitual (actividad económica) | Rendimiento de actividades económicas | Base general (general base) |
| Payment for goods/services in crypto | Disposal at market value — ganancia patrimonial | Base del ahorro (savings) |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether habitual trading or occasional | Treat as occasional (savings base) unless clear business indicators |
| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without acquisition cost |
| Unknown whether foreign or Spanish exchange | Assume foreign — check Modelo 721 obligation |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — affects worldwide vs source taxation |
| Unknown whether staking reward or airdrop | Treat as staking reward (savings base — rendimiento del capital mobiliario) |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — transaction history from exchange(s) or wallet(s), confirmation of Spanish tax residency, and indication of whether activity is occasional investment or habitual trading.

**Recommended** — full CSV exports from all exchanges used (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bit2Me, Revolut, etc.), wallet addresses with on-chain history, cost basis records for each acquisition, record of staking/lending/mining activity, and Modelo 721 filing history.

**Ideal** — complete portfolio tracker export (e.g. CoinTracking, Koinly, TaxDown), DeFi protocol interaction history, NFT purchase/sale records, AEAT borrador pre-populated data for cross-checking, and documentation of any token airdrops received.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-ESC-1 — Residency unknown.** "Spain taxes worldwide income of tax residents. Non-residents are only taxed on Spain-source income. Cannot proceed without confirming tax residency status."

**R-ESC-2 — No transaction records.** "Crypto tax computations require detailed transaction records with dates, amounts, and counterparties. AEAT applies FIFO method across ALL exchanges — without complete records, gains cannot be calculated. Cannot proceed."

**R-ESC-3 — Corporate crypto holdings.** "Companies holding crypto (Impuesto sobre Sociedades) have different accounting and tax treatment. This skill covers individuals (IRPF) only. Escalate to an asesor fiscal."

**R-ESC-4 — Actividad económica classification disputes.** "Whether crypto activity constitutes a business (actividad económica) under Article 27 LIRPF has complex indicators including regularity, infrastructure, and intent. Escalate to a qualified professional."

**R-ESC-5 — Cross-border DeFi/DAO structures.** "Complex DeFi arrangements involving multiple jurisdictions, DAOs, or governance tokens require specialist international tax advice. Escalate."

## Section 3 — Rate Tables

### 3.1 Savings Base (Base del Ahorro) — Rates for 2025

Crypto capital gains and investment income are taxed at progressive rates on the savings base. Rates updated by Ley 7/2024 effective 1 January 2025.

| Taxable Savings Income | Rate | Cumulative Tax |
|---|---|---|
| First €6,000 | 19% | €1,140 |
| €6,001 – €50,000 | 21% | €10,380 |
| €50,001 – €200,000 | 23% | €44,880 |
| €200,001 – €300,000 | 27% | €71,880 |
| Over €300,000 | 30% | — |

**Citation:** Ley 7/2024, disposición final séptima, modifying Article 66 LIRPF. Confirmed by AEAT Manual de Renta 2025.

**Note:** The top rate was increased from 28% to 30% by Ley 7/2024 effective 1 January 2025. The combined rate includes both the state portion (cuota íntegra estatal) and the autonomous community portion (cuota íntegra autonómica).

### 3.2 General Base (Base General) — Progressive Rates for 2025

Applies to airdrops (not derived from a transfer), mining income if occasional, and habitual trading classified as actividad económica.

| Taxable General Income | Marginal Rate (approx. combined) |
|---|---|
| Up to €12,450 | 19% |
| €12,451 – €20,200 | 24% |
| €20,201 – €35,200 | 30% |
| €35,201 – €60,000 | 37% |
| €60,001 – €300,000 | 45% |
| Over €300,000 | 47% |

**Note:** Exact rates vary by autonomous community. Rates shown are approximate combined state + CCAA.

### 3.3 Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)

Crypto holdings count toward net wealth. National threshold: €700,000 exemption (plus €300,000 for primary residence). Rates from 0.2% to 3.5% depending on CCAA. Madrid and Andalusia effectively exempt via 99-100% bonification. Catalonia and Valencia apply full rates.

**Impuesto Temporal de Solidaridad de Grandes Fortunas (ITSGF):** Net wealth > €3 million taxed at 1.7%–3.5% regardless of CCAA bonifications. Applies 2022–2024; check status for 2025.

---

## Section 4 — Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 FIFO — Mandatory

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| FIFO (First In, First Out) | **Mandatory** — required by AEAT per DGT consulta V1604-18 |
| LIFO | NOT permitted |
| Average cost | NOT permitted |
| Specific identification | NOT permitted |

**Critical rule:** FIFO must be applied **per type of homogeneous cryptocurrency** (e.g. all BTC, all ETH) and **consolidated across all exchanges and wallets**. You cannot apply FIFO per exchange — it must be a single global FIFO queue per coin.

### 4.2 Cost Basis Components

The acquisition cost (valor de adquisición) includes:
- Purchase price in EUR (converted at exchange rate on acquisition date)
- Exchange fees, commissions, and spreads paid on acquisition
- Network/gas fees directly attributable to the acquisition

The disposal value (valor de transmisión) includes:
- Sale proceeds in EUR (or market value of asset received in a swap)
- Less: exchange fees, commissions paid on disposal

### 4.3 Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps (Permutas)

Every crypto-to-crypto swap is a **taxable event** (permuta under Article 37.1.h LIRPF). AEAT treats it as a simultaneous disposal of the outgoing crypto and acquisition of the incoming crypto.

- Disposal value = market value of the crypto received at the time of the swap
- Acquisition cost of new crypto = same market value (plus any fees)
- Gain/loss = disposal value minus FIFO cost basis of the outgoing crypto

## Section 5 — DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrop Treatment

### 5.1 Staking and Lending Rewards

| Type | Treatment | Tax Base |
|---|---|---|
| Staking rewards (PoS validation) | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario | Base del ahorro — 19%–30% |
| Lending interest (Aave, Compound, etc.) | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario | Base del ahorro — 19%–30% |
| Yield farming rewards | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario | Base del ahorro — 19%–30% |
| Liquidity mining tokens | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario (if passive) or ganancia patrimonial | Context-dependent |

- Taxable at market value in EUR on receipt date
- Cost basis of received tokens = market value at receipt (for future disposals)

### 5.2 Mining

| Scenario | Treatment | Tax Base |
|---|---|---|
| Occasional / hobby mining | Ganancia patrimonial no derivada de transmisión | Base general — progressive rates 19%–47% |
| Habitual / commercial mining (actividad económica) | Rendimiento de actividades económicas | Base general — progressive rates, plus alta en Modelo 036, epígrafe IAE 831.9, and RETA registration |

Indicators of actividad económica: regular mining operation, dedicated hardware, systematic approach, intent to generate ongoing income (per Article 27 LIRPF).

### 5.3 Airdrops

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Gratuitous airdrop (no action required) | Ganancia patrimonial no derivada de transmisión — base general at progressive rates |
| Airdrop for service (sign-up, referral, task) | Ganancia patrimonial no derivada de transmisión — base general |

- Taxable at market value on receipt
- Cost basis for future disposal = market value at receipt

### 5.4 Hard Forks

No specific AEAT guidance. Conservative treatment:
- Cost basis of original coin: unchanged
- Cost basis of forked coin: €0
- Subsequent disposal: full proceeds treated as gain

---

## Section 6 — NFT Treatment

NFTs are treated as crypto-assets under Spanish tax law. No separate regime exists.

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Purchase of NFT with crypto | Disposal of crypto (taxable event) + acquisition of NFT |
| Sale of NFT for fiat | Capital gain/loss on savings base |
| Sale of NFT for crypto | Permuta — taxable at market value |
| Creation and sale of NFT (artist) | Actividad económica if habitual — base general |
| NFT royalties | Rendimiento del capital mobiliario or actividad económica depending on regularity |

FIFO applies if you hold multiple identical NFTs (e.g. editions from the same collection).

---

## Section 7 — Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Modelo 100 — Annual IRPF Return

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Casillas 1800–1814 | Ganancias y pérdidas patrimoniales por transmisión de monedas virtuales — detail each transaction: acquisition date, disposal date, acquisition value, disposal value |
| Casilla 0031 | Rendimientos del capital mobiliario (staking, lending rewards) |
| Casilla 0304/0305 | Pérdidas patrimoniales to offset (if applicable) |

**Filing:** 1 April – 30 June of the following year via Renta WEB.

### 7.2 Modelo 721 — Foreign Crypto Declaration

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Obligation | Mandatory when the aggregate value of crypto held on foreign exchanges/custodians exceeds €50,000 as of 31 December |
| Who must file | Spanish tax residents (individuals and entities) |
| Deadline | 1 January – 31 March of the following year |
| Subsequent years | Required again only if there is an increase > €20,000 over the last declared value |
| Penalties | €5,000 per datum omitted or incorrectly reported (minimum €10,000) |
| Legal basis | Ley 11/2021 (disposición adicional 13ª LGT); Orden HFP/886/2023 |

### 7.3 Modelos 172 and 173 — Exchange Reporting

Since 2024, Spanish-registered crypto exchanges (Bit2Me, Bitnovo, Criptan, etc.) must file:
- **Modelo 172:** Annual report of client crypto balances
- **Modelo 173:** Annual report of client crypto operations

This means AEAT has independent data to cross-reference against your Modelo 100.

### 7.4 Record-Keeping

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 4 years from end of relevant tax year (general prescription period under Article 66 LGT) |
| Records to maintain | Full transaction logs from all exchanges, wallet addresses, global FIFO ledger per coin, staking/mining logs, Modelo 721 copies |
| Burden of proof | On the taxpayer — AEAT can request supporting documentation in an inspection |

---

## Section 8 — Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

### 8.1 Savings Base Losses

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Same-year offset | Pérdidas patrimoniales on the savings base can offset ganancias patrimoniales on the savings base |
| Cross-category offset (same base) | Up to 25% of rendimientos del capital mobiliario can be offset by capital losses (and vice versa) |
| Carry-forward | Uncompensated losses carry forward for **4 years** |
| Cross-base offset | Savings base losses CANNOT offset general base income |

### 8.2 General Base Losses

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Same-year offset | Losses on the general base can offset general base income |
| Carry-forward | 4 years |

### 8.3 Anti-Abuse Rule (Norma Antirecompra) — Article 33.5.f LIRPF

Spain has a re-acquisition rule similar to (but distinct from) the US wash sale rule:

- If you sell a crypto asset **at a loss** and reacquire **the same asset** (homogeneous) within **2 months** (before or after the sale), the loss is **suspended** — it cannot be recognised until the replacement asset is itself disposed of outside the 2-month window.
- For assets traded on a regulated market, the period extends to **1 year** (before or after). Most crypto is NOT on a regulated market, so the 2-month rule applies.
- The suspended loss is **not lost** — it is added to the cost basis of the replacement asset.
- **Citation:** Article 33.5.f Ley 35/2006 LIRPF; DGT consulta V1604-18.

---

## Section 9 — Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 General Anti-Abuse Provision (Norma General Antielusión)

Article 15 of the Ley General Tributaria (LGT) empowers AEAT to disregard arrangements that are:
- Wholly or partly artificial
- Entered into with the main purpose of obtaining a tax advantage
- Contrary to the spirit of the legislation

AEAT can recharacterise transactions to reflect their economic substance.

### 9.2 Specific Crypto Anti-Avoidance

| Measure | Detail |
|---|---|
| Modelo 721 (foreign holdings) | Failure to declare → €5,000 per datum penalty; unjustified capital gains may be imputed |
| Modelos 172/173 (exchange data) | AEAT receives automatic data from Spanish exchanges since 2024 |
| DAC8 / CARF (from 2026) | Cross-border automatic exchange of crypto data from EU and partner jurisdictions |
| Exit taxation | If you cease to be a Spanish tax resident, unrealised gains on crypto > €4 million may be taxable under exit tax rules (Article 95 bis LIRPF) |
| Impuesto de Solidaridad | Prevents circumventing wealth tax via CCAA bonifications for net wealth > €3 million |

### 9.3 Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty Range |
|---|---|
| Failure to file Modelo 100 with crypto | 50%–150% of unpaid tax (sanción grave/muy grave) |
| Failure to file Modelo 721 | €5,000 per datum omitted (minimum €10,000) |
| Late filing | Recargo (surcharge) 1%–20% depending on delay, plus interest |

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Buy-and-Sell BTC, Savings Base

**Input:** Spanish tax resident. Bought 1 BTC at €25,000 in February 2025. Sold 1 BTC at €55,000 in October 2025. Exchange fees: €150 on purchase, €200 on sale. No other savings income.

**Computation:**
```
Disposal value:    €55,000 − €200 (sale fee) = €54,800
Acquisition cost:  €25,000 + €150 (purchase fee) = €25,150
Gain:              €54,800 − €25,150 = €29,650

Tax (savings base):
  First €6,000 × 19% =  €1,140
  Next €23,650 × 21% =  €4,966.50
  Total:                 €6,106.50
```

### Example 2 — Crypto-to-Crypto Swap (Permuta)

**Input:** Spanish tax resident. Acquired 10 ETH at €1,200 each in March 2024 (total cost: €12,000). In June 2025, swapped 10 ETH for 0.5 BTC when ETH market price = €3,800 each.

**Computation:**
```
Disposal value of ETH:    10 × €3,800 = €38,000
Acquisition cost (FIFO):  10 × €1,200 = €12,000
Gain on ETH disposal:     €38,000 − €12,000 = €26,000

Tax on €26,000 (savings base):
  First €6,000 × 19% =  €1,140
  Next €20,000 × 21% =  €4,200
  Total:                 €5,340

New cost basis of 0.5 BTC: €38,000 (for future disposal FIFO)
```

### Example 3 — Loss with Re-Acquisition (Anti-Abuse Rule)

**Input:** Spanish tax resident. Sold 2 BTC at €40,000 each on 1 August 2025. FIFO cost basis: €50,000 each. Loss: €20,000. Repurchased 2 BTC at €39,000 each on 15 August 2025 (within 2 months).

**Computation:**
```
Loss on sale:     (€40,000 − €50,000) × 2 = −€20,000
Re-acquisition:   Within 2 months → Article 33.5.f applies
Loss status:      SUSPENDED — cannot be recognised in 2025
New cost basis:   €39,000 + €10,000 (suspended loss per BTC) = €49,000 per BTC

The suspended loss is effectively preserved in the increased
cost basis and will be recognised when the replacement BTC
is disposed of (outside the 2-month window).
```

## Self-Checks

Before delivering any Spain crypto tax computation, verify:

- [ ] Residency confirmed — Spanish tax resident (worldwide income) or non-resident (source only)?
- [ ] FIFO applied globally per coin across ALL exchanges and wallets
- [ ] Every crypto-to-crypto swap treated as a taxable permuta
- [ ] Staking/lending classified as rendimiento del capital mobiliario (savings base)
- [ ] Airdrops classified on general base (not savings base)
- [ ] 2-month anti-abuse rule checked for any loss + re-acquisition
- [ ] Modelo 721 obligation checked (foreign crypto > €50,000 at 31 Dec)
- [ ] Rates reflect Ley 7/2024 update (30% top bracket, not 28%)
- [ ] Wealth tax exposure checked (especially for Catalonia/Valencia residents)
- [ ] Output labelled as estimated — flag for professional review

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER use the old top savings rate of 28% — it is 30% from 2025 per Ley 7/2024
- NEVER apply FIFO per-exchange — it must be a single global FIFO queue per coin type
- NEVER ignore crypto-to-crypto swaps — they are ALL taxable events in Spain
- NEVER classify staking rewards on the general base — they go on the savings base as rendimiento del capital mobiliario
- NEVER forget the 2-month re-acquisition anti-abuse rule for losses
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
- NEVER omit Modelo 721 analysis for clients with foreign exchange holdings
- NEVER advise on CNMV regulatory matters — this skill covers tax only
- NEVER compute gains without verified cost basis and complete FIFO records
