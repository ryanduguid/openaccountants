## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Three Parallel Systems

Spain operates three distinct but overlapping e-invoicing/reporting systems:

1. **FACe (B2G)**: Mandatory electronic invoicing to public administrations since 2015
2. **SII (Real-Time Reporting)**: Near real-time VAT ledger reporting to AEAT for large taxpayers since 2017
3. **Veri\*factu + B2B E-Invoicing**: Anti-fraud certified invoicing software and mandatory B2B structured invoice exchange (phasing in 2026--2028)

### Who Must Comply

| System | Who | Since/From |
|---|---|---|
| FACe (B2G) | All suppliers to Spanish public entities | 15 January 2015 |
| SII | Companies with annual turnover > EUR 6M, monthly VAT filers, REDEME members, large corporate groups | 1 July 2017 |
| Veri\*factu (RRSIF) | Corporate income tax payers (Impuesto sobre Sociedades) | 1 January 2027 |
| Veri\*factu (RRSIF) | Self-employed (IRPF economic activities) and other obligados tributarios | 1 July 2027 |
| B2B e-invoicing | Businesses with turnover > EUR 8M | 1 October 2027 |
| B2B e-invoicing | All remaining businesses and professionals | 1 October 2028 |

### Veri\*factu vs Non-Veri\*factu

Under RD 1007/2023 (RRSIF), all invoicing software must be certified in one of two modes:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| Veri\*factu | Real-time online transmission of invoice records (registros de facturación) to AEAT; includes QR tributario on every invoice; automatic chain integrity via hash linking |
| Non-Veri\*factu | Offline storage of invoice records with strict integrity, inalterability, traceability, and completeness guarantees; no real-time transmission but audit-ready on demand |

SII participants may continue using SII instead of Veri\*factu, but their software must still comply with RRSIF technical requirements.

### B2B E-Invoicing (RD 238/2026)

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Structured format | EN 16931-based: CII, UBL, Facturae, or EDIFACT |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### IVA Rates (2025/2026)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 21% | Standard rate (tipo general) |
| 10% | Reduced rate (tipo reducido) -- food, water, hospitality, transport |
| 4% | Super-reduced rate (tipo superreducido) -- bread, milk, medicines, books |
| 0% | Temporarily applied to essential food items (extended through 2025) |

### IRPF Withholding (Retención)

Professional service invoices may include IRPF withholding:

| Scenario | Rate |
|---|---|
| Standard professional withholding | 15% |
| New professional (first 3 years) | 7% |

The invoice must show gross amount, IVA, IRPF retention, and net payable separately.

### Rounding

- Tax per line: `base imponible × tipo impositivo / 100`, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Standard arithmetic rounding
- Invoice total = sum of taxable bases + sum of IVA amounts − sum of retenciones
- SII and Veri\*factu validate that reported amounts are arithmetically consistent

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

- Each IVA rate must appear as a separate `TaxesOutputs/Tax` block (Facturae) or BG-23 group (EN 16931)
- Exempt operations require the applicable exemption cause (e.g., Art. 20 LIVA)
- Reverse charge (inversión del sujeto pasivo) requires explicit mention and IVA = 0%

### Equivalence Surcharge (Recargo de Equivalencia)

For retail businesses under the equivalence surcharge regime:

| IVA Rate | Surcharge |
|---|---|
| 21% | 5.2% |
| 10% | 1.4% |
| 4% | 0.5% |

The surcharge must appear as a separate line in the invoice.

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT (IVA) Return Integration

- **SII participants**: Invoice data is reported in near real-time via SII, replacing quarterly Modelo 303 informational annexes. SII data pre-populates the annual Modelo 390 summary and feeds into compliance risk assessment.
- **Veri\*factu participants**: Invoice records transmitted to AEAT provide a parallel real-time view of all transactions. AEAT can cross-reference Veri\*factu data with Modelo 303 declarations.
- **B2B e-invoicing**: Invoice data flowing through SPFE will progressively feed into pre-filled VAT returns, similar to Italy's SDI model.

### Income Tax Integration

- Self-employed professionals (autónomos): Invoice data, including IRPF withholdings reported via SII/Veri\*factu, feeds into the annual Modelo 100 (IRPF return)
- The Modelo 130 (quarterly IRPF prepayment) relies on accurate invoice records
- Companies: Corporate income tax (Impuesto sobre Sociedades, Modelo 200) is reconciled against SII/Veri\*factu transaction records

### Withholding Tax Reporting

- IRPF retenciones reported on invoices must reconcile with Modelo 111 (quarterly withholding return) and Modelo 190 (annual summary)
- Veri\*factu invoice records capture retention amounts, enabling automated cross-checks

### Intra-EU and Cross-Border

- Intra-EU supplies are reported via Modelo 349 (recapitulative statement)
- SII captures intra-EU transaction details in the libro registro de facturas
- Cross-border import VAT is managed through customs declarations (DUA) linked to invoice records
