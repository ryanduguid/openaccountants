---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Rental Income (Rendimientos del Capital Inmobiliario)

| Income Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Monthly rent received | Full amount assessable (rendimiento íntegro) |
| Tenant payment of owner expenses (e.g., IBI) | Assessable income if landlord's obligation |
| Security deposit retained (for damages) | Assessable when retained |
| Key money / premium paid by tenant | Assessable |
| Sub-leasing income | Capital mobiliario (different category) unless property owned |

### 2.2 Deductible Expenses (Gastos Deducibles) -- Art. 23 LIRPF

| Expense | Deductible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage interest (intereses del préstamo) | Yes | Limited to rental income (cannot create a loss from interest alone) |
| IBI (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles) | Yes | Annual property tax paid to municipality |
| Comunidad de propietarios (community fees) | Yes | Monthly/quarterly community charges |
| Insurance (seguro del hogar, RC) | Yes | Building insurance, liability |
| Repairs and maintenance (reparación y conservación) | Yes | Restoring to habitable condition; not improvements |
| Legal fees (abogado, procurador) | Yes | Related to tenancy |
| Property management (administración) | Yes | Agency fees |
| Utilities (paid by landlord) | Yes | If landlord bears cost |
| Amortización (depreciation) | Yes | 3% of construction cost (see below) |
| Service charges (portería, jardinería) | Yes | If landlord's obligation |
| Bad debts (saldos de dudoso cobro) | Yes | After 6 months unpaid + legal action initiated |
| Garbage tax (tasa de basuras) | Yes | Municipal waste charge |

### 2.3 Non-Deductible / Capital Expenses

| Expense | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Improvements (mejoras) | NOT deductible -- add to acquisition cost (increase cost base) |
| Enlargement / expansion | NOT deductible -- capital |
| Furniture purchase | Depreciated at 10% per year (not immediately deductible) |
| Principal repayment of mortgage | NOT deductible (only interest) |

### 2.4 Amortización (Depreciation)

**Rate:** 3% per annum on the greater of:
1. Acquisition cost of construction (excluding land value), or
2. Valor catastral of construction component (from IBI receipt)

**Land/construction split:** The recibo del IBI shows valor catastral del suelo (land) and valor catastral de la construcción (building) separately. Apply 3% to construction portion only.

**Example:**
- Purchase price: €200,000
- IBI shows: 40% land, 60% construction
- Construction cost: €200,000 × 60% = €120,000
- Annual depreciation: €120,000 × 3% = €3,600

### 2.5 The 60% Reduction (Reducción por arrendamiento de vivienda)

| Condition | Reduction |
|---|---|
| Property rented as tenant's vivienda habitual (primary residence) | 60% of net positive rental income |
| Tourist / short-term rental | No reduction |
| Commercial / office rental | No reduction |
| Reduction base | Applied to positive net income ONLY (not losses) |

**Ley 12/2023 (Housing Law) updated reductions** (effective for new contracts from 2024):
- 90% if rent reduced by 5%+ on new contract in zona tensionada
- 70% if rented to young tenant (18-35) in zona tensionada, or social housing
- 60% if substantial rehabilitation performed
- 50% base reduction (replaces 60% for new contracts post-2024)

**Note:** The traditional 60% reduction continues to apply to pre-existing contracts. For new contracts post-2024, the base reduction is 50% unless enhanced conditions are met.

### 2.6 Interest Expense Limitation

Interest on mortgage used to purchase/renovate the rental property is deductible, BUT:
- Interest + repair expenses CANNOT exceed rental income (they cannot generate a fiscal loss from these specific items)
- Excess interest/repair costs carry forward to subsequent years (5-year limit under Art. 23.1.a LIRPF)

### 2.7 Non-Resident Rental Income

| Resident Status | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Non-resident (non-EU/EEA) | 24% | Gross rental income (NO deductions allowed) |
| Non-resident (EU/EEA including Norway, Iceland) | 19% | Net income (deductions allowed, same as IRPF) |
| Filing form | Modelo 210 | Quarterly within 20 days of end of quarter |

### 2.8 Imputación de Rentas Inmobiliarias (Imputed Income)

For properties that are:
- Owned by the taxpayer
- NOT the taxpayer's primary residence (vivienda habitual)
- NOT rented out
- NOT used for business

**Imputed income = valor catastral × 2%** (or 1.1% if catastral value was revised in the last 10 years).

This is taxed at marginal rates as part of the general tax base. It applies to second homes, empty apartments, etc.

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Gross Rental Income (Rendimiento Íntegro)
Total rent received/receivable for the year.

### Step 2: Deductible Expenses (Gastos Deducibles)
Sum all allowable expenses including depreciation (3% of construction).

### Step 3: Net Rental Income (Rendimiento Neto)
Gross income − deductible expenses.

### Step 4: Apply 60% Reduction (if applicable)
If vivienda habitual of tenant: Net × (1 − 60%) = reduced amount.
E.g., Net income €10,000 → Reduced to €4,000 (only €4,000 taxed).

### Step 5: Report on Modelo 100
Include in rendimientos del capital inmobiliario section.
Taxed at marginal IRPF rates (general tax base, not savings base).

---

## Section 5 -- Tourist Rental (Vivienda de Uso Turístico)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| 60% reduction | NOT available for tourist rental |
| Comunidad rules | Each region has its own licensing requirements (licencia turística) |
| IVA/IGIC | No VAT if individual without additional hospitality services |
| With services (limpieza, recepción) | May be subject to IVA at 10% (actividad económica) |
| Declaration | Modelo 179 (platform reporting to AEAT) |
| Obligations | Tourist licence; municipal restrictions; Modelo 100 as rendimientos |

---

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Partially Rented Year
Expenses are apportioned between rented period and vacant period. Imputed income applies to the vacant period (if not available for rent).

### 6.2 Below-Market Rent (e.g., to family)
If rented below market value, AEAT may impute income at market rate. Minimum imputed income = imputed income that would apply if empty (valor catastral × 2%/1.1%).

### 6.3 Co-Ownership (Proindiviso)
Each co-owner reports their share of income and expenses proportional to ownership percentage.

### 6.4 Rental at a Loss
Net rental losses are part of the general tax base and can offset other general income (employment, business). The 60% reduction does NOT apply to losses (only to positive net income).

### 6.5 Non-Resident with Multiple Properties
Each property requires a separate Modelo 210 filing. Imputed income also requires Modelo 210 for vacant properties.

---

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the 60% reduction to tourist/short-term rental
- NEVER apply the 60% reduction to a rental loss (only positive net income)
- NEVER allow non-EU non-residents to deduct expenses (24% on gross)
- NEVER depreciate the land component -- only construction value
- NEVER exceed the 3% depreciation rate for the property itself
- NEVER deduct mortgage principal as an expense
- NEVER ignore imputación de rentas for vacant non-primary properties
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
