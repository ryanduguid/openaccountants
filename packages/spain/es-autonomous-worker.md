## Section 2 -- Cuota de Autónomos 2025: Cotización por Ingresos Reales

Since January 2023, self-employed workers pay Social Security (cuota de autónomos) based on actual income (rendimientos netos). The system has 15 brackets deployed gradually until 2032.

### The 15 Contribution Brackets (Tramos) -- 2025

| Tramo | Net Monthly Income (EUR) | Minimum Contribution (EUR/month) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ≤ 670 | 200 |
| 2 | 670.01 - 900 | 250 |
| 3 | 900.01 - 1,166.70 | 267 |
| 4 | 1,166.71 - 1,300 | 291 |
| 5 | 1,300.01 - 1,500 | 294 |
| 6 | 1,500.01 - 1,700 | 294 |
| 7 | 1,700.01 - 1,850 | 310 |
| 8 | 1,850.01 - 2,030 | 315 |
| 9 | 2,030.01 - 2,330 | 320 |
| 10 | 2,330.01 - 2,760 | 330 |
| 11 | 2,760.01 - 3,190 | 350 |
| 12 | 3,190.01 - 3,620 | 370 |
| 13 | 3,620.01 - 4,050 | 390 |
| 14 | 4,050.01 - 6,000 | 400 |
| 15 | > 6,000 | 530 |

**Contribution rate:** 31.4% of chosen base de cotización (the contribution amounts above are the minimums -- workers can choose higher bases within their bracket for better future pensions).

### How to Calculate Net Monthly Income (Rendimiento Neto)

For autónomos persona física in estimación directa:

```
1. Annual gross income (ingresos brutos)
2. MINUS deductible expenses (gastos deducibles)
3. MINUS 7% generic deduction (3% for autónomos societarios)
4. DIVIDE by 12 = Monthly net income (rendimiento neto mensual)
```

### Key Rules

- **6 changes per year:** You can change your contribution base up to 6 times annually to match income fluctuations
- **Annual regularization:** After year-end, TGSS compares actual income vs. chosen base. Overpayments are refunded; underpayments are collected (second half of following year)
- **Autónomos societarios minimum:** EUR 1,000/month base → EUR 314/month minimum contribution

---

## Section 3 -- Tarifa Plana (Flat Rate for New Autónomos)

### Standard Tarifa Plana (DA 52ª LGSS, RDL 13/2022)

| Period | Monthly Contribution |
|---|---|
| Months 1-12 | EUR 80 |
| Months 13-24 (if income < SMI) | Reduced rate (tramo-dependent) |

### Requirements

- Not registered as autónomo in the previous 2 years
- Not previously benefited from tarifa plana in the previous 3 years
- No outstanding debts with Seguridad Social or Hacienda

- Must apply at the moment of registration (alta)

### Extended Tarifa Plana (24 months at EUR 80)

- Victims of terrorism

### Important Notes

- Request is automatic when registering (mark the box in Modelo TA.0521)

- Compatible with pluriactividad (working as both employed and self-employed)

## Section 6 -- Net Take-Home Calculation (Sueldo Neto Autónomo)

### Monthly Calculation Formula

```
Facturación bruta (without IVA)
+ IVA/IGIC/IPSI repercutido (charged to client)
= Total factura (amount on invoice)
- Retención IRPF (15% or 7% withheld by client, if applicable)
= Cobro efectivo (cash received)
- Cuota autónomos (Social Security)
- Gastos deducibles
= Neto mensual aproximado

IVA/IGIC/IPSI a pagar Hacienda = repercutido - soportado (on purchases)
```

### Annual Calculation Formula

```
Facturación bruta anual
- Gastos deducibles anuales
- Cuota autónomos anual
- 5% gastos difícil justificación (max EUR 2,000, if simplificada)
= Base imponible IRPF

IRPF anual = Apply progressive brackets to base imponible
Neto anual = Facturación bruta - IRPF - Cuota SS - Gastos
```

### Worked Example: IT Freelancer, Madrid, EUR 3,000/month billing

```
Monthly:
  Facturación bruta:            EUR 3,000
  + IVA 21%:                    EUR 630
  = Total factura:              EUR 3,630
  - Retención IRPF 15%:        EUR 450
  = Cobro efectivo:             EUR 3,180
  - Cuota autónomos (Tramo 9): EUR 320
  - Gastos deducibles:          EUR 200
  = Neto mensual estimado:      EUR 2,660

Annual:
  Facturación bruta:            EUR 36,000
  - Gastos deducibles:          EUR 2,400
  - Cuota autónomos:            EUR 3,840
  - Gastos difícil justificación: EUR 1,488 (5% × 29,760, < 2,000)
  = Base imponible:             EUR 28,272
  IRPF estimado (escala 2025):  ~EUR 5,600
  Neto anual:                   EUR 36,000 - 5,600 - 3,840 - 2,400 = EUR 24,160
  Neto mensual real:            EUR 2,013
  % neto sobre facturación:     ~67%
```

**Note:** The monthly "neto" from cash flow differs from the annual real neto because retenciones are prepayments that may result in refund or additional payment at year-end.
