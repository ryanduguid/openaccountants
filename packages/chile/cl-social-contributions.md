## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- **Required inputs before computing** — Before computing, you MUST obtain: 1. Does client issue boletas de honorarios? -- mandatory withholding applies 2. Total gross boleta income for the year -- determines renta imponible 3. AFP affiliation -- which AFP and its comisión 4. Health system -- Fonasa or Isapre 5. Any employment income? -- dual status rules 6. Tax year -- phase-in complete from 2025. If client does not issue boletas, confirm whether voluntary contributor.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-CL-SOC-1 -- Bilateral agreement** — Trigger: foreign national with bilateral social security agreement. Message: "Bilateral agreements may exempt from Chilean cotizaciones. Escalate for legal review."

### Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions list** — NEVER compute without knowing whether client issues boletas; NEVER use prior year's tope imponible -- verify UF-based cap; NEVER tell a boleta issuer they can opt out from 2025 -- phase-in complete; NEVER ignore the 80% factor -- gross boleta is NOT the base; NEVER assume Fonasa -- confirm Fonasa vs Isapre; NEVER present AFP comisión without confirming specific AFP; NEVER assume withholding covers full cotización -- shortfalls are common

## Section 3 -- Renta imponible and tope

- **renta_imponible formula** — renta_imponible = gross_boleta_income x 80% / 12  _(DL 3.500 Art. 90)_
- **80% factor and tope cap** — The 80% factor accounts for 20% presumed expenses. Capped at tope imponible (87.8 UF/month, variable in CLP).  _(DL 3.500 Art. 90)_

## Section 4 -- Contribution rates

**Contribution rates table**

| Component | Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AFP (pension) | 10% | Mandatory capitalization |
| AFP comisión | 0.46%-1.44% | Varies by AFP |
| SIS | ~1.49% | Set annually |
| Salud (Fonasa) | 7% | Mandatory statutory |
| Salud (Isapre) | 7% minimum | Difference paid directly by client |

- **Total effective rate** — Total effective: ~18.95-19.93% of renta imponible.

## Section 5 -- Withholding and annual settlement

### Withholding from boletas

| Destination | SII holds, distributes at Operación Renta |

### Operación Renta (April)
