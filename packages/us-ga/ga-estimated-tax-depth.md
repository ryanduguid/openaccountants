# Georgia Estimated Tax — Depth Skill (Tax Year 2025)

> **Companion to `ga-income-tax.md`**: That skill establishes the GA personal income tax framework — the 5.19% flat rate (2025), residency rules, retirement income exclusion, and Form 500 mechanics. A November 2025 review noted that the estimated-tax discussion in `ga-income-tax.md` was thin: it stated the basic $1,000 threshold but did not address the high-income 110% safe harbor, the annualized income method, the underpayment penalty mechanics, or the interaction with the PTE election under O.C.G.A. §48-7-23. This skill fills those gaps.
>
> **Statutory basis**: O.C.G.A. §48-7-114 through §48-7-126 (individual estimated tax and underpayment penalty); O.C.G.A. §48-7-21 (corporate estimated tax); O.C.G.A. §48-7-23 (PTE election); Georgia Department of Revenue Regulation 560-7-8-.34 (estimated tax administration); Form 500-ES instructions (TY 2025); Form 500-UET (Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals); Form 600-ES (Corporate); GA-8453 (electronic filing declaration that also captures penalty computation references).
>
> **Citation discipline**: Every rate, threshold, and safe-harbor percentage cited below is verifiable against the TY 2025 Form 500-ES instructions and the underlying O.C.G.A. sections. Where the DOR interest rate is given as a range (currently 7-9% depending on the quarter), use the actual published rate for the period of underpayment when running the penalty computation — do not hardcode.

## 1. Scope

This skill covers:

- **Individual income tax estimated payments** under O.C.G.A. §48-7-114 — sole proprietors, single-member LLCs disregarded for federal tax, partners in pass-through entities, S-corp shareholders, W-2 employees with significant side income, and recipients of investment income or retirement distributions not covered by withholding.
- **Fiduciary estimated payments** (trusts and estates) — same Form 500-ES schedule applies; the safe harbor rules track the individual rules.
- **Corporate estimated payments** under O.C.G.A. §48-7-21 — C-corporations using Form 600-ES; the safe harbor is 100% of prior year with no current-year alternative under Georgia law.
- **Underpayment penalty computation** on Form 500-UET (for individuals) — the GA-8453 electronic filing declaration references the penalty but the computation itself is performed on Form 500-UET.
- **Interaction with the PTE election** under O.C.G.A. §48-7-23 — when an entity makes the PTE election, the entity is liable for the state tax on the pass-through income and the individual owner's estimated tax liability is reduced accordingly. This is the most error-prone area in GA estimated tax planning.

This skill does **NOT** cover:

- Federal estimated tax (Form 1040-ES) — defer to `us-quarterly-estimated-tax.md`.
- Withholding tax mechanics for employers — out of scope.
- Net worth tax (which is an annual filing on Form 600, not estimated).
- The PTE election decision itself (whether to make it) — defer to `ga-corporate-and-ptet.md`.
- Non-resident estimated tax for Georgia-source income — covered briefly only as it interacts with the safe harbor.

## 2. Required Threshold — When Estimated Tax Is Required

### 2.1 Individual threshold

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-114(a), a Georgia resident individual must make estimated tax payments for the current tax year if the expected Georgia income tax liability **after withholding and refundable credits** exceeds **$1,000**.

The threshold is computed as:

```
Expected GA tax liability  −  Expected GA withholding  −  Refundable credits  >  $1,000  →  Estimated payments required
```

**Key clarifications**:

1. **After withholding**, not gross liability. A taxpayer with $4,000 expected GA tax and $3,500 in W-2 GA withholding has only $500 of expected balance — under the threshold, no estimated payments required.
2. **Refundable credits** (e.g., the low-income credit) reduce the liability before the test. Non-refundable credits do too, since they reduce the expected liability.
3. The test is on the **current year** expected liability, not the prior year. A taxpayer whose prior year liability was $5,000 is not automatically required to make estimated payments if the current year liability is expected to drop below the $1,000 threshold (e.g., due to a sabbatical, business shutdown, or qualifying retirement distributions).
4. The threshold has not been indexed since the statute was last amended. It is a flat $1,000 for TY 2025.

### 2.2 Fiduciary threshold

Same $1,000 threshold applies for trusts and estates filing Form 501. Estimated payments are made on Form 500-ES (the fiduciary uses the same voucher as individuals — there is no separate fiduciary estimated voucher in Georgia).

### 2.3 Corporate threshold

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-21(b), a C-corporation must make estimated payments if its expected Georgia income tax liability for the year exceeds **$500**. The lower threshold reflects the fact that corporations do not have withholding analogous to the individual W-2 mechanism.

---

## 3. Installment Schedule — The 25/25/25/25 Rule

### 3.1 Four equal installments

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-115, the required annual payment is divided into four equal installments of **25% each**, due on:

| Installment | TY 2025 Due Date | Period Covered |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | **April 15, 2025** | Jan 1 – Mar 31, 2025 |
| 2nd | **June 15, 2025** | Apr 1 – May 31, 2025 |
| 3rd | **September 15, 2025** | Jun 1 – Aug 31, 2025 |
| 4th | **January 15, 2026** | Sep 1 – Dec 31, 2025 |

**Important quirks**:

- The 2nd installment covers only **two months** (April and May) — this is not a typo; it is consistent with the federal Form 1040-ES schedule and is the source of much confusion. The "quarterly" label is a misnomer.
- The 4th installment falls in the **following calendar year** (January of the year after the tax year).
- When a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Georgia legal holiday, the deadline shifts to the next business day. For TY 2025, April 15 is a Tuesday, June 15 is a Sunday (shifts to **June 16, 2025**), September 15 is a Monday, and January 15, 2026 is a Thursday.

### 3.2 Fiscal-year taxpayers

For taxpayers on a fiscal year other than the calendar year, the installment due dates are the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 1st-following months of the fiscal year. A taxpayer with a fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 would have due dates of October 15, 2025; December 15, 2025; March 15, 2026; and July 15, 2026.

### 3.3 Late-arising income — first installment skip

If the taxpayer's circumstances change such that estimated payments become required only after April 15 (for example, a business that becomes profitable in mid-year, or an unexpected capital gain in Q3), the catch-up rules under O.C.G.A. §48-7-115(b) apply:

- If the requirement first arises between April 1 and June 1: the first installment is due **June 15** and equals 50% of the required annual payment; remaining 25% / 25% due Sep 15 and Jan 15.
- If the requirement first arises between June 1 and September 1: the first installment is due **September 15** and equals 75%; remaining 25% due Jan 15.
- If the requirement first arises after September 1: a single payment of 100% is due January 15.

In practice, the safe harbor (Section 5) often allows a taxpayer to defer payments without penalty even if the income arises late in the year, by referencing prior-year tax.

---

## 4. Form 500-ES — The Voucher

### 4.1 What Form 500-ES is

Form 500-ES is a **payment voucher**, not a return. It accompanies each quarterly payment and identifies:

- Taxpayer name, SSN/ITIN (or FEIN for entities), and address;
- Tax year for which the payment applies;
- Installment number (1, 2, 3, or 4);
- Amount enclosed.

There is **no annual reconciliation form for estimated payments**. The total of the four 500-ES payments is reported on Form 500, Line 21 (for TY 2025; line numbers may shift between years), and applied as a credit against the total tax liability.

### 4.2 Payment methods

Georgia DOR accepts:

1. **Georgia Tax Center (GTC)** online payment — preferred. ACH debit from a bank account; no fee. Generates an electronic 500-ES equivalent.
2. **Credit/debit card** through approved third-party processor — service fee applies.
3. **Paper check** with mailed Form 500-ES voucher — slowest; payment is dated on the postmark date if mailed by USPS first-class mail under the timely-mailing-is-timely-filing rule.

### 4.3 Common voucher errors

- **Wrong tax year** on the voucher (Q1 2025 payment marked for TY 2024 instead of TY 2025) — this is the #1 misapplied-payment cause and often leads to an underpayment penalty notice even when payment was made on time.
- **SSN typo** — payment posts to wrong account; taxpayer gets penalty notice and also a "credit balance" on another taxpayer's account.
- **Installment number not marked** — DOR generally applies to the earliest open installment, but this can cause downstream allocation issues if a refund is claimed.

---

## 5. Safe Harbor — The 100% / 70% Rule

### 5.1 The general rule

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-120 and Form 500-UET, no underpayment penalty applies if the taxpayer's total timely payments (withholding + estimated installments) equal or exceed **the LESSER of**:

(a) **100% of the prior year's Georgia income tax liability**, OR
(b) **70% of the current year's Georgia income tax liability**.

Georgia's 70% current-year safe harbor is **lower** than the federal 90% — this is a meaningful difference and creates planning opportunities. A taxpayer who pays exactly 70% of current-year tax through withholding and estimates avoids GA penalty even if they would fail the federal 90% test (though they would still owe federal penalty).

### 5.2 The high-income 110% modifier

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-120(d), if the taxpayer's prior year **federal adjusted gross income** exceeded:

- **$150,000** (single, head of household, qualifying surviving spouse, or MFJ), OR
- **$75,000** (married filing separately),

then the prior-year safe harbor is increased from 100% to **110% of prior year tax**. The 70% current-year safe harbor is unchanged.

The high-income safe harbor uses **federal AGI**, not Georgia AGI. This matters for taxpayers whose Georgia AGI differs significantly from federal AGI due to:

- The Georgia retirement income exclusion (which reduces GA AGI but not federal AGI);
- Net operating loss carryforwards that differ between federal and state;
- Non-Georgia source income for part-year residents.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT #1 — $150K high-income 110% safe harbor missed**: This is the most common preparer error in GA estimated tax planning. A taxpayer whose prior-year federal AGI was, say, $180,000 will see preparers plan around the 100% prior-year safe harbor; this leaves a 10% shortfall and exposes the taxpayer to underpayment penalty even though the prior-year tax was fully paid. ALWAYS check prior-year federal AGI before locking in the prior-year safe harbor strategy. The check is mechanical: prior year Form 1040 Line 11 (federal AGI) — if > $150,000 ($75,000 MFS), use 110%.

### 5.3 Lower of — which prior year?

The "prior year" means the immediately preceding tax year **provided that prior year was a full 12-month tax year and a Georgia return was filed**. For a taxpayer who:

- Was a non-resident the prior year and only filed federal: the prior-year safe harbor is not available — the taxpayer must use the 70% current-year safe harbor.
- Filed a short-year return: the prior-year liability is annualized for safe harbor purposes.
- Had zero Georgia tax in the prior year: the safe harbor is effectively zero (i.e., any current-year liability requires current-year payment to avoid penalty); however if the prior-year return showed zero tax AND the taxpayer was a GA resident for all 12 months AND there was no liability, then the prior-year safe harbor is satisfied by paying zero — see O.C.G.A. §48-7-120(c).

### 5.4 Allocation across installments

The safe harbor must be met **on a cumulative installment basis**, not annually. The required cumulative payment after each installment is:

| After installment | Cumulative % of safe-harbor amount |
|---|---|
| 1 (Apr 15) | 25% |
| 2 (Jun 15) | 50% |
| 3 (Sep 15) | 75% |
| 4 (Jan 15) | 100% |

A taxpayer who underpays Q1 but overpays Q2 is still penalized for the Q1 underpayment for the period it was outstanding (Apr 16 to the date the Q2 payment was made). Withholding, however, is treated as paid **ratably** across the four installments unless the taxpayer elects otherwise — this gives W-2 employees an advantage over self-employed taxpayers.

---

## 6. Annualized Income Installment Method

### 6.1 When to use it

The annualized income method, available under O.C.G.A. §48-7-120(e) and computed on Form 500-UET Part III, allows taxpayers with **seasonal or lumpy income** to base each installment on the income actually earned through that period, rather than on 25% of the full-year liability.

Use the annualized method when:

- A self-employed taxpayer's income is concentrated in Q4 (e.g., a tax preparer earns most income Jan-Apr or a retailer earns most income Nov-Dec);
- A capital gain occurs late in the year (e.g., a stock sale in November);
- A large bonus or commission payment occurs in a specific quarter;
- A business launches mid-year and has no Q1 or Q2 income;
- A taxpayer realizes Roth conversion income or large IRA distributions in a single quarter.

### 6.2 The four annualization periods

| Installment | Period | Annualization factor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 (3 months) | × 4 |
| 2 | Jan 1 – May 31 (5 months) | × 2.4 |
| 3 | Jan 1 – Aug 31 (8 months) | × 1.5 |
| 4 | Jan 1 – Dec 31 (12 months) | × 1 |

For each installment, the taxpayer:

1. Computes Georgia taxable income through the end of the period;
2. Annualizes by multiplying by the factor above;
3. Applies the 2025 flat 5.19% rate to compute annualized tax;
4. Applies the **cumulative installment percentage** (22.5% / 45% / 67.5% / 90% for the 90% method, or 17.5% / 35% / 52.5% / 70% for the 70% current-year safe harbor) to determine the required cumulative payment through that installment;
5. Subtracts cumulative withholding and prior installments to determine the current installment amount.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT #2 — Annualized method calculation errors**: The annualized method requires careful interim books and reconciliation between federal Form 2210 Schedule AI and Georgia Form 500-UET Part III. Common errors include:
>
> - **Using federal cumulative percentages** (22.5/45/67.5/90) instead of **Georgia cumulative percentages** (17.5/35/52.5/70 if relying on the 70% current-year safe harbor). Georgia's lower current-year safe harbor flows through to the annualized computation, so the cumulative percentages are lower.
> - **Forgetting the annualization factor must be applied to GA-source income only** for part-year residents — full-year residents use total income.
> - **Failing to lock in the annualized method consistently** across all four installments. The IRS rule (and Georgia follows) is that once elected, the method must be used for the entire year on Form 500-UET; you cannot mix annualized for Q1 and regular for Q2.
> - **Double-counting capital gains** — the gain is included in the period the realization occurred, not spread across the year.

### 6.3 Documentation requirement

The annualized method requires the taxpayer to be able to demonstrate income earned through each cumulative period. For self-employed taxpayers, this means **interim P&Ls** as of March 31, May 31, and August 31. Without contemporaneous books, the annualized method is not defensible on examination and the taxpayer reverts to the standard 25/25/25/25 method.

---

## 7. Underpayment Penalty — Form 500-UET

### 7.1 Penalty mechanics

Form 500-UET (Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals) computes the penalty on each underpaid installment for the period of underpayment.

The formula is:

```
Penalty for installment i  =  Underpaid amount × DOR interest rate × (Days underpaid / 365)
```

The "days underpaid" runs from the installment due date to the **earlier of**:

- The date the underpayment was paid; or
- The original due date of the annual return (April 15, 2026 for TY 2025).

### 7.2 GA Department of Revenue interest rate

The DOR interest rate is set quarterly by the Commissioner under O.C.G.A. §48-2-40 and equals the **federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points**, rounded to the nearest whole percent. For 2025 quarters, the rate has been published as follows (illustrative — verify each quarter against the current DOR publication):

| Quarter | DOR Annual Interest Rate |
|---|---|
| Q1 2025 (Jan-Mar) | ~9% |
| Q2 2025 (Apr-Jun) | ~9% |
| Q3 2025 (Jul-Sep) | ~8% |
| Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec) | ~8% |
| Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar) | ~7% (projected) |

The rate **applicable to each underpayment period** is the rate in effect during that period. A Q1 underpayment outstanding from April 16, 2025 through January 15, 2026 accrues interest at the Q2, Q3, and Q4 2025 rates over the relevant sub-periods.

### 7.3 No de minimis — but the $1,000 threshold acts as a floor

There is no de minimis below which penalty is waived. However, because the $1,000 threshold under §48-7-114 must be exceeded before estimated payments are required at all, a taxpayer whose balance due is under $1,000 owes no penalty by definition.

### 7.4 Waivers under O.C.G.A. §48-7-126

Penalty may be waived in cases of:

- **Casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstances** beyond the taxpayer's control (death of a spouse, hospitalization, federally declared disaster zone);
- **Retirement after age 62** in the year of retirement or the year following — limited circumstances;
- **First year of becoming a Georgia resident** — penalty waived for Q1 and Q2 of the year of relocation.

Waiver requests go on Form 500-UET Part IV with attached explanation; reasonable cause is interpreted similarly to federal Form 2210 reasonable cause.

### 7.5 Form GA-8453 reference

Form GA-8453 is the **individual income tax declaration for electronic filing**. It is not the penalty computation form — that is Form 500-UET. However, GA-8453 includes attestations that any computed penalty has been included in the return totals, so paid preparers electronically filing GA returns must ensure Form 500-UET has been completed (or the no-penalty boxes affirmatively checked) before signing GA-8453.

---

## 8. PTE Election Interaction

### 8.1 The PTE election in brief

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-23 (enacted by HB 149, effective for tax years beginning on or after Jan 1, 2022), an electing pass-through entity (S-corporation or partnership) may pay Georgia income tax at the entity level on its Georgia-source income at the **5.19% flat rate** (2025) and the owners exclude their distributive share of that income from their Georgia individual returns.

See `ga-corporate-and-ptet.md` for the full mechanics of the election. This section covers only the **estimated tax interaction** for individual owners.

### 8.2 Entity-level estimated payments under the PTE election

When a PTE election is in effect, the **entity itself** is responsible for estimated payments on the entity-level tax, using Form 600S-ES (S-corp) or Form 700-ES (partnership). The entity's estimated payment schedule is the same 25/25/25/25 schedule with the corporate $500 threshold.

### 8.3 Effect on individual owner's estimated tax

For the individual owner:

1. **Distributive share income from the electing PTE is excluded from GA AGI** on Form 500, Schedule 1 adjustment. The owner does NOT include this income in computing their expected GA tax liability.
2. **The owner's expected GA tax liability drops** by the amount that would have been attributable to the PTE income.
3. **The owner's estimated tax requirement is recomputed** based on the reduced expected liability. If the resulting expected liability after withholding is under $1,000, the owner has no estimated payment obligation.
4. **The owner does NOT take a credit** for the entity-paid tax on Form 500 (because the income was excluded entirely, not just credited). This is different from the federal SALT-cap workaround treatment where the federal deduction flows through the K-1.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT #3 — PTE election quarterly payments confusion**: This is the highest-risk area in current GA estimated tax practice. Common errors:
>
> - **Owner continues making individual estimated payments** at the pre-election level, generating large refunds and triggering reconciliation issues. Solution: Recompute the owner's required annual payment promptly after the PTE election is made, and reduce or eliminate individual Form 500-ES payments.
> - **Entity fails to make timely entity-level estimated payments**, triggering an entity-level penalty on Form 600S-UET or equivalent. The election does not relieve the entity of the estimated tax requirement; it shifts the obligation.
> - **PTE election is made mid-year** (e.g., the entity elects for TY 2025 in early 2025 but the owner had already made a Q1 individual estimated payment based on prior expectations) — the Q1 individual payment can be either left as-is (and refunded on the annual Form 500) or recharacterized via correspondence with DOR. Recharacterization is administratively burdensome; usually preparers leave the Q1 payment in place and skip Q2/Q3/Q4 individual payments.
> - **Withholding on owner's W-2 from the same entity** (for owner-employees of S-corps): withholding continues at the wage level regardless of the PTE election. Don't double-count by treating the entity's PTE payment as also covering the wage withholding obligation.
> - **Safe harbor base mismatch**: After a PTE election in the current year, the owner's prior-year liability (used for the 100%/110% safe harbor) was higher than the current-year expected liability. Using the prior-year safe harbor will significantly over-pay. Use the 70% current-year safe harbor instead, which is recomputed against the (lower) post-election liability.

### 8.4 Decision tree

```
Did the entity make a PTE election for the current tax year?
├── NO  → Owner's estimated tax = full pass-through income × 5.19%; standard rules apply.
└── YES → Owner excludes PTE income from GA AGI.
         │
         ├── Was prior-year safe harbor based on a non-election year?
         │   ├── YES → Prior-year safe harbor will overpay. Switch to 70% current-year safe harbor.
         │   └── NO  → Prior-year safe harbor is already aligned; continue using.
         │
         ├── Does owner have other income (W-2, investment, non-PTE business)?
         │   ├── YES → Compute estimated tax on residual income; threshold test applies.
         │   └── NO  → No individual estimated payments required if PTE income is the only source.
         │
         └── Is owner also receiving W-2 wages from the electing S-corp?
             ├── YES → Owner's W-2 withholding continues; PTE payment is separate. Do NOT
             │        treat entity payment as substitute for wage withholding.
             └── NO  → Standard analysis.
```

## 9. Corporate Estimated Tax (Form 600-ES)

### 9.1 Threshold and schedule

C-corporations with expected GA income tax liability exceeding **$500** must make estimated payments on the same 25/25/25/25 schedule, using **Form 600-ES**.

### 9.2 Corporate safe harbor

Under O.C.G.A. §48-7-21(c), the corporate safe harbor is **100% of prior-year tax** only. There is **no current-year alternative** safe harbor for corporations equivalent to the 70% individual rule. There is also no high-income 110% modifier.

This means:

- A corporation in a growth year can use the prior-year safe harbor and avoid penalty even if current-year tax is substantially higher.
- A corporation with a prior-year loss has no safe harbor (prior-year tax was zero) and must pay 100% of current-year tax through estimates to avoid penalty — but if prior year was a full 12-month tax year with zero liability, the safe harbor is satisfied by zero payments. The corporation must have actually filed a return for the prior year.
- A first-year corporation has no prior-year base and must compute estimates based on current-year expectations; the penalty applies if estimates fall short. Some practitioners pay a nominal Q1 to establish a Q1 baseline.

### 9.3 Corporate annualized method

A corporate annualized income installment method is available, analogous to the individual method. The annualization periods and factors are the same. Computed on Form 600-UET.

### 9.4 Net worth tax

The Georgia net worth tax (on Form 600 Schedule 3) is an annual tax based on the corporation's apportioned net worth. It is **not subject to estimated payments**; it is paid with the annual return. Do not include net worth tax in the estimated tax base.

## 10. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Self-employed sole proprietor paying quarterly

**Facts**: Maya is a Georgia-resident freelance graphic designer (sole proprietor, no LLC). Prior year (TY 2024) federal AGI was $95,000, GA AGI was $93,000 (after retirement income exclusion adjustments), and GA tax liability was $4,400. Current year (TY 2025) expected GA AGI is $110,000 with expected GA tax of $5,500. No W-2 withholding.

**Threshold test**: Expected liability $5,500 − $0 withholding = $5,500 > $1,000 → estimated payments required.

**Safe harbor**:
- Prior year safe harbor: 100% × $4,400 = $4,400 (prior year federal AGI $95K, under $150K, so 100% applies)
- Current year safe harbor: 70% × $5,500 = $3,850
- **Lower of**: $3,850 → required annual payment is $3,850.

**Installment schedule**:
- Q1 due Apr 15, 2025: $963 (25%)
- Q2 due Jun 16, 2025: $963 (25%, shifted from Jun 15 Sunday)
- Q3 due Sep 15, 2025: $962 (25%)
- Q4 due Jan 15, 2026: $962 (25%)

**Form 500-ES vouchers**: Four vouchers, each marked TY 2025, with installment numbers 1/2/3/4. Maya pays online through Georgia Tax Center.

### Example 2 — W-2 employee with side gig

**Facts**: Daniel is a GA-resident software engineer with a $180,000 W-2 (Georgia withholding $8,400). He also has a freelance consulting side business expected to generate $40,000 net SE income for TY 2025. Prior year (TY 2024) federal AGI was $195,000 (over $150K), prior year GA tax was $8,800, prior year GA withholding was $8,200 (covered prior-year tax with a small balance due).

**Threshold test**: Expected GA tax = ($180,000 + $40,000) × 5.19% ≈ $11,420 (simplified, no major adjustments). Expected withholding $8,400. Net = $3,020 > $1,000 → estimated payments required.

**Safe harbor — HIGH INCOME 110% applies**:
- Prior year federal AGI was $195,000 > $150,000 → 110% modifier.
- Prior-year safe harbor: 110% × $8,800 = $9,680
- Current-year safe harbor: 70% × $11,420 = $7,994
- **Lower of**: $7,994 → required annual payment is $7,994.

**Withholding allocated ratably across installments**: $8,400 / 4 = $2,100 per installment.
**Required cumulative through each installment**: $1,999 / $3,997 / $5,996 / $7,994.
**Cumulative withholding through each installment**: $2,100 / $4,200 / $6,300 / $8,400.

Withholding alone exceeds the safe harbor at every installment. **No additional estimated payments required**.

> Note: Without the 110% modifier (using just 100% × $8,800 = $8,800 vs 70% × $11,420 = $7,994), the lower-of is still $7,994 and the answer doesn't change in this example. But if prior year GA tax had been, say, $7,500, the 110% rule would have given $8,250 vs $7,994 → lower-of $7,994 (same result). The 110% modifier matters most when the 70% current-year safe harbor is HIGHER than 100% of prior year — see Example 3.

### Example 3 — High-income with the 110% modifier mattering

**Facts**: Priya is a GA resident with $400,000 prior-year federal AGI (well over $150K). Prior year GA tax was $20,000 (all paid through withholding, no balance). Current year she expects similar income but no withholding (she retired mid-year and is now drawing from a sole proprietor consulting practice). Current-year expected GA tax: $19,000.

**Safe harbor**:
- 100% of prior year = $20,000
- **110% of prior year (high-income) = $22,000**
- 70% of current year = $13,300
- **Lower of (using 110%): $13,300** → required annual payment is $13,300.

Without applying the 110% modifier, a preparer might think the safe harbor is the lower of $20,000 vs $13,300 = $13,300 (same answer). But this is a coincidence — the 110% modifier doesn't change the bottom line when the 70% current-year safe harbor is already lower. The modifier matters when:

- Current-year income is significantly higher than prior year, AND
- 70% × current year > 100% × prior year.

In that scenario, the preparer who forgets the 110% modifier would set the safe harbor at $20,000 when it should be $22,000, and underpay by $2,000 across the four installments → penalty exposure.

> **The lesson**: ALWAYS check the 110% modifier eligibility before locking in the safe harbor strategy, even if the answer turns out to be the same.

### Example 4 — S-corp owner with PTE election interaction

**Facts**: Marcus owns 100% of a GA S-corporation that elects PTE treatment under O.C.G.A. §48-7-23 for TY 2025. The S-corp expects $250,000 of Georgia-source income. Marcus also receives a $90,000 W-2 from the S-corp (GA withholding $4,200). Prior year (TY 2024) the PTE election was NOT in effect; Marcus's prior year GA tax was $16,000 (on combined $90K W-2 + $240K K-1 income) and prior year federal AGI was $325,000.

**Entity-level analysis**: S-corp pays 5.19% × $250,000 = $12,975 in entity-level tax on Form 600S, with $3,243.75 due each quarter on Form 600S-ES.

**Individual analysis** (Marcus):
- Expected GA AGI = $90,000 W-2 only (PTE income excluded under §48-7-23).
- Expected GA tax ≈ $90,000 × 5.19% = $4,671 (simplified; ignoring personal exemption and standard deduction for clarity).
- Expected withholding = $4,200.
- Net balance = $471. **Under $1,000 → NO individual estimated payments required.**

**The PTE-election trap**: A preparer using the prior-year safe harbor would have computed: 110% × $16,000 = $17,600 required annual payment for Marcus (high-income, AGI over $150K). Subtracting expected $4,200 withholding = $13,400 to pay in estimates. **This would massively overpay because $12,975 of that liability has shifted to the entity.**

The correct approach: Recognize that the PTE election fundamentally changes the prior-year baseline. Use the **70% current-year safe harbor** ($4,671 × 70% = $3,270), which is below withholding ($4,200) → no individual estimates needed.

> **The PTE-election quarterly payments confusion AUDIT FLASH POINT #3**: This is exactly the trap. A preparer who mechanically applies the 110% prior-year safe harbor without recognizing the PTE-election change will set Marcus up to overpay by $13,000+ in individual estimated tax that ultimately gets refunded. The correct strategy is to use the current-year safe harbor in the first year of a PTE election, then reset to the prior-year safe harbor in year 2 when the prior-year baseline reflects the post-election liability.

### Example 5 — Capital gain in Q4 — annualized method

**Facts**: Janet is a GA-resident retiree with $50,000 of pension and SS income (effective GA tax after retirement exclusion: $1,200, all covered by elective withholding). In November 2025 she sells investment property for a $300,000 long-term capital gain (Georgia taxes capital gains at ordinary rates — 5.19% in 2025). Additional GA tax: $300,000 × 5.19% = $15,570. Prior year (TY 2024) GA tax was $1,150, prior year federal AGI was $52,000.

**Threshold test**: Net expected liability $15,570 + $50 (small residual on pension) = $15,620 > $1,000 → estimated required.

**Without annualized method**:
- Prior-year safe harbor: $1,150 (under $150K AGI, no 110% modifier)
- Current-year safe harbor: 70% × $15,620 = $10,934
- Lower of: $1,150 → required annual payment is $1,150 already covered by pension withholding. **No penalty.**

This is the **prior-year safe harbor magic**: even though Janet has a massive Q4 income event, she owes no GA underpayment penalty because her prior-year baseline was so low. She will owe ~$14,400 with the TY 2025 return on April 15, 2026, but no underpayment penalty.

**With annualized method (alternative)**: If Janet did NOT have the prior-year safe harbor available (e.g., she was a non-resident in 2024), the annualized method would help:

- Through 3/31: Income = $12,500 pension (3/12 of $50K). Annualized = $50,000. GA tax = $1,200. Required cumulative payment = 17.5% × $1,200 = $210.
- Through 5/31: Income = $20,833. Annualized = $50,000. Required cumulative = 35% × $1,200 = $420.
- Through 8/31: Income = $33,333. Annualized = $50,000. Required cumulative = 52.5% × $1,200 = $630.
- Through 12/31: Income = $50,000 + $300,000 = $350,000. (Full year, no annualization.) GA tax = $15,620. Required cumulative = 70% × $15,620 = $10,934.

Under annualization, Janet would owe $10,934 − $1,200 elected withholding − $0 prior installments = $9,734 with the Q4 installment due Jan 15, 2026. Significantly better than 25/25/25/25, which would have required $2,737 per quarter starting Apr 15 — and would have generated penalty on Q1, Q2, Q3 underpayments because the capital gain hadn't yet occurred.

## 12. Self-Checks

Before signing off on a Georgia estimated tax plan, the reviewer must affirmatively answer:

1. Has the prior-year federal AGI been checked against $150,000 ($75,000 MFS) for the 110% modifier? (AUDIT FLASH POINT #1)
2. If the annualized method is being used, are interim P&Ls available through 3/31, 5/31, and 8/31? Are the GA cumulative percentages (17.5/35/52.5/70) being used, not the federal (22.5/45/67.5/90)? (AUDIT FLASH POINT #2)
3. If the taxpayer is an owner of an electing PTE, has the prior-year safe harbor base been examined for distortion from the election? Has the owner's expected liability been recomputed excluding PTE income? (AUDIT FLASH POINT #3)
4. Have all four installment due dates been adjusted for weekend/holiday shifts in the current year?
5. Has the lower-of-100%/70% (or 110%/70%) computation been documented in the workpapers?
6. If corporate, has the no-current-year-alternative limitation been recognized (only 100% prior-year safe harbor for corporations)?
7. For the first installment, was the late-arising-income rule under O.C.G.A. §48-7-115(b) considered if the requirement first arose after April 15?
8. Are Form 500-ES vouchers (or GTC online payments) labeled with the correct tax year and SSN?

## 13. Refusal Catalogue

This skill refuses to opine on:

- The advisability of making the PTE election itself (defer to `ga-corporate-and-ptet.md` and a credentialed reviewer).
- Whether to take a federal §164 SALT deduction for entity-level PTE payments (federal issue; defer to federal skills and credentialed reviewer).
- Combined-group corporate estimated tax computations (out of scope; the skill covers single-entity corporate estimates only).
- Multi-state apportionment for partial-year residents (defer to a specialized multi-state skill).
- Audit defense strategy for an existing underpayment penalty notice (requires individual case review by a credentialed reviewer).
