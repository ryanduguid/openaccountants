## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax year 2025 rate

| Rate | Applies to |
|---|---|
| 5.19% (flat) | All Georgia taxable income |

Source: O.C.G.A. § 48-7-20, as amended by HB 111 (2025). Rate reduced from 5.39% (2024) to 5.19% (2025).

**2026 rate:** Under HB 111, the rate automatically drops by 0.10% per year until reaching 4.99%, subject to revenue targets. Expected 2026 rate is 5.09% (pending Georgia Department of Audits certification).

### Standard deduction (tax year 2025)

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
|---|---|
| Single | $12,000 |
| Married filing jointly | $24,000 |
| Married filing separately | $12,000 |

- You have income subject to Georgia tax but not federal tax, OR
- Your gross income exceeds $24,000 (MFJ) or $12,000 (all other filers)

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** Georgia begins with federal adjusted gross income (AGI) from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

### Key additions to Georgia income (Schedule 3)
- Interest on obligations of other states (not Georgia or federal)
- Bonus depreciation add-back (Georgia does NOT conform to federal §168(k) bonus depreciation)
- Other state-specific additions

### Key subtractions from Georgia income (Schedule 3)
- Social Security benefits (Georgia fully exempts Social Security from state income tax)
- Retirement income exclusion under O.C.G.A. §48-7-27(a)(5): up to **$35,000** per taxpayer age 62–64; up to **$65,000** per taxpayer age 65+ (includes retirement plan distributions, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income). Within the exclusion, earned income (wages, self-employment income) is capped at $4,000.
- Georgia lottery winnings (first $5,000 exempt)
- Military retirement income (up to $35,000 for taxpayers under 62)

### Net result
Federal AGI ± Georgia modifications = Georgia adjusted gross income → minus standard deduction → minus dependent exemptions = Georgia taxable income → × 5.19% = Georgia income tax.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
Georgia starts from federal AGI. The federal QBI deduction (§199A) is below AGI and does NOT flow into Georgia's computation. Georgia taxable income is computed independently.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI. Flows through to Georgia automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI. No Georgia add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI. Flows through automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form 500-ES)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $1,000 or more after withholding and credits.

Voucher due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.

Safe harbor: No penalty if payments equal at least 70% of current year tax OR 100% of prior year tax (110% if prior-year AGI exceeded $150,000), per O.C.G.A. § 48-7-120.

### Bonus depreciation add-back
Georgia has NOT adopted federal bonus depreciation under §168(k). Taxpayers who claimed bonus depreciation on the federal return must add back the excess over Georgia's allowed depreciation (typically straight-line MACRS) and then claim the Georgia depreciation as a subtraction in subsequent years.
