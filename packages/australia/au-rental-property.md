### Select the income year before calculating

The rate and threshold tables immediately below are for **2026-27**. Ask which income year is being
prepared before calculating anything: the second resident bracket was 16 cents in 2024-25 and
2025-26 and is 15 cents from 1 July 2026, and the Medicare levy surcharge thresholds move each
year. For a prior year, use that year's tables on ato.gov.au. [ATO, Tax rates: Australian
resident](https://www.ato.gov.au/tax-rates-and-codes/tax-rates-australian-residents)

The classification, deduction, depreciation and CGT rules in Sections 2 to 8 do not depend on the
income year, except where a section says otherwise.

### Key Thresholds (2026-27)

**Key Thresholds (2026-27)**

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Tax-free threshold | $18,200 |
| Medicare levy | 2% of taxable income |
| Medicare levy surcharge (no PHI) | 1%, 1.25% or 1.5% where income for MLS purposes exceeds $105,000 single or $210,000 family in 2026-27 ($101,000 and $202,000 in 2025-26) |
| CGT discount (individuals, 12+ months) | 50% |
| Div 43 rate (post-Sep 1987 residential) | 2.5% of construction cost |
| Div 43 rate (post-Feb 1992 short-term traveller) | 4% |
| Low-value asset pool threshold | $1,000 (Div 40) |
| Immediate deduction threshold (Div 40) | $300 |

### Individual Marginal Tax Rates (2026-27)

**Individual Marginal Tax Rates (2026-27)**

| Taxable Income (AUD) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 18,200 | 0% | $0 |
| 18,201 -- 45,000 | 15% | $4,020 |
| 45,001 -- 135,000 | 30% | $31,020 |
| 135,001 -- 190,000 | 37% | $51,370 |
| 190,001+ | 45% | -- |

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown apportionment (private vs rental) | 0% deductible |
| Unknown whether repair or improvement | Treat as improvement (capitalise) |
| Unknown construction cost for Div 43 | Do not claim -- obtain quantity surveyor report |
| Unknown settlement date for CGT | Do not compute -- obtain contract |
| Unknown cost base | Do not compute CGT -- escalate |

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Rental Income

**Rental Income Types**

| Income Type | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Rent received from tenant | Assessable -- full amount received or receivable |
| Bond forfeited (retained for damage) | Assessable in year retained |
| Insurance payout (loss of rent) | Assessable |
| Reimbursement from tenant (excess utilities) | Assessable |
| Key money / lease premium | Assessable |

- **All gross rental income** — All gross rental income is assessable. Report at Item 21 (Rent) on the Individual Tax Return. (Report at Item 21 (Rent) on the Individual Tax Return)

### 2.2 Negative Gearing

- **Negative gearing** — Where total deductions exceed gross rental income, the net rental loss reduces other assessable income (salary, business income). This remains the position for income years up to and including 2026-27.
- **Enacted limit from 1 July 2027** — Negative gearing for residential property investments is limited to new builds from 1 July 2027. Properties held at 7:30 pm AEST on 12 May 2026 are exempt from the limit. The measure was announced in the 2026-27 Federal Budget and the ATO states it is now law. Establish the acquisition date and whether the property is a new build before projecting a rental loss into 2027-28 or later.  _([ATO, Reforming negative gearing and capital gains tax](https://www.ato.gov.au/about-ato/new-legislation/in-detail/individuals/tax-reform-boosting-home-ownership-reforming-negative-gearing-and-capital-gains-tax); [Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Reform No. 1) Act 2026](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2026A00049/latest))_

### 2.3 Deductible Expenses (Immediate)

**Deductible Expenses (Immediate)**

| Expense | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Interest on investment loan | Deductible | Must trace loan purpose to rental property |
| Council rates | Deductible | Apportioned if part-private |
| Water rates / charges | Deductible |  |
| Body corporate / strata fees | Ordinary administration and general maintenance contributions may be deductible | Special levies funding a particular capital improvement are not immediately deductible. Check capital-works eligibility and timing after work is completed and charged to the fund. [ATO common property expenses](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/common-property-expenses) |
| Land tax | Deductible |  |
| Property management fees | Deductible | Agent commissions, letting fees |
| Insurance (landlord, building, contents) | Deductible |  |
| Advertising for tenants | Deductible |  |
| Pest control | Deductible |  |
| Gardening / lawn mowing (if provided to tenant) | Deductible |  |
| Tax agent fee (rental schedule portion) | Deductible |  |
| Travel to property (removed from 1 Jul 2017) | NOT deductible | Unless carrying on a rental property business |

- **Borrowing expenses** — Loan establishment fees, lenders mortgage insurance, valuation fees and stamp duty on the mortgage are borrowing expenses, not interest. If they total more than $100, spread them over five years or the loan term, whichever is shorter; $100 or less is deductible in the year incurred.  _([ITAA 1997 (Cth) s 25-25](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=PAC/19970038/25-25); [ATO, Common property expenses](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/common-property-expenses))_

### 2.4 Repairs vs Improvements (TR 97/23)

**Repairs vs Improvements (TR 97/23)**  _([TR 97/23](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=TXR/TR9723/NAT/ATO/00001))_

| Characteristic | Repair (immediate deduction) | Improvement (capitalise) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Restores to original condition | Yes | No |
| Replaces with substantially same materials | Yes | No -- better quality/different character |
| Initial repair on acquisition | NOT deductible (capital) | Capital -- add to cost base |
| Replaces a roof | Can be a repair where it restores part of the building without an improvement; the roof is not automatically the relevant entirety | Initial repairs, improvements and replacement of the relevant entirety are capital; apply [TR 97/23](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=TXR/TR9723/NAT/ATO/00001) to the facts |
| Example: patching cracked tiles | Repair | -- |
| Example: replacing all tiles with stone | -- | Improvement |
| Example: replacing broken tap with same model | Repair | -- |
| Example: full kitchen renovation | -- | Improvement |

- **Identify the entirety and the cause** — For each repair, identify the asset or entirety repaired, its condition when acquired, the cause of the deterioration and what the work changed. Modern materials can restore an asset without making every job an improvement, and an itemised invoice that separates repair from capital work supports the split.  _([ATO, Repair and maintenance expenses](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/repair-and-maintenance-expenses))_

### 2.5 Division 40 -- Plant & Equipment Depreciation

**Division 40 Effective Lives**  _(Income Tax Assessment (Effective Life of Depreciating Assets) Determination 2025, Table A, Residential property operators (67110). [2025 determination, Schedule 2 Table A](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01097/asmade))_

These are Commissioner-determined lives in the 2025 Effective Life Determination's residential property operators table. Confirm the determination applicable when the asset starts use; a supportable self-assessed life is a separate choice.

| Asset | Effective Life (ATO) | Decline Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hot water system (gas or electric) | 12 years | Diminishing value or prime cost |
| Hot water system (solar) | 15 years | Either |
| Carpet | 8 years | Either |
| Internal window blinds | 10 years | Either |
| Window curtains | 6 years | Either |
| Oven / cooktop | 12 years | Either |
| Air conditioning (split system) | 10 years | Either |
| Dishwasher | 8 years | Either |
| Smoke alarm | 6 years | Either |
| Ceiling fan | 5 years | Either |

The table follows Table A, Residential property operators (67110), in the *Income Tax Assessment (Effective Life of Depreciating Assets) Determination 2025*. Choose the applicable determination under section 40-95, including its contract-date and start-time rules, or a valid self-assessed life; do not automatically reset an existing asset register. See [2025 determination, Schedule 2 Table A](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2025L01097/asmade).

- **Diminishing value rate** — 200% ÷ effective life
- **Prime cost rate** — 100% ÷ effective life
- **Limitation (from 1 Jul 2017)** — For residential rental properties, only the first owner (or entity that had the asset newly installed) can claim Div 40 deductions. Subsequent owners cannot claim plant & equipment depreciation on existing assets -- they inherit zero depreciable value for previously used items (unless an exception applies, e.g., refurbishment by new owner).
- **Exceptions to the second-hand asset limit** — The limit has commencement and transitional rules and exceptions, including qualifying new residential premises, substantially renovated premises and specified entities or businesses. A new appliance bought by the owner is not denied because the building is old; the test is whether the asset was previously used.  _([ATO, Second-hand depreciating assets](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/depreciating-assets-in-rental-properties/second-hand-depreciating-assets))_

### 2.6 Division 43 -- Capital Works Deduction

**Division 43 Capital Works Deduction Rates**

| Construction Date | Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordinary residential works begun before 18 July 1985 | 0% | Outside the ordinary residential commencement category |
| Ordinary residential works begun 18 July 1985 to 15 September 1987 | 4% | Subject to qualifying use and remaining expenditure |
| Ordinary residential works begun after 15 September 1987 | 2.5% | Subject to qualifying use and remaining expenditure |
| Qualifying traveller-accommodation works begun before 27 February 1992 | 4% if begun after 21 August 1984 and before 16 September 1987; otherwise 2.5% | Apply the eligible-work and current-use conditions. A 1990 start does not receive 4% merely for traveller use |
| Qualifying works begun after 26 February 1992 | Basic 2.5%; 4% for qualifying uses under s 43-145 | Traveller accommodation must satisfy the relevant use conditions |

- **Base** — Original construction cost (obtain from quantity surveyor report or builder records). NOT the purchase price of the property.
- **Undeducted construction cost:** A new owner continues the annual deduction using the original eligible construction expenditure and remaining deduction period, subject to qualifying use and the remaining expenditure cap. For $400,000 of eligible 2.5% construction after ten full years, $300,000 remains and the full-year deduction continues at $10,000 for the remaining 30 years. (ITAA 1997 Div 43, ss 43-15 and 43-70.)

### 2.7 Interest Deductibility

- **Nexus requirement** — The loan must have a clear nexus to producing rental income. Key rules follow in the table.
- **Mixed-purpose loans and redraws** — A private redraw creates a private component of the loan, and later repayments reduce the rental and private components proportionately; the owner cannot direct every repayment to the private debt. Interest follows the use of the borrowed money, so trace each drawdown and keep the split current.  _([ATO, Interest expenses](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/interest-expenses); [TR 2000/2](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=TXR/TR20002/NAT/ATO/00001))_

**Interest Deductibility Scenarios**

| Scenario | Deductible? |
| --- | --- |
| Loan to purchase rental property | Yes -- full interest |
| Loan to renovate rental property | Yes -- full interest |
| Refinanced loan (same purpose, same or lower amount) | Yes |
| Loan redrawn for personal use | No -- apportioned |
| Line of credit (mixed purpose) | Must trace each drawdown |
| Interest on loan while property vacant (available for rent) | Yes |
| Interest directly attributable to constructing an intended rental property | May be currently deductible under s 8-1 before rental availability where the income-producing intention and other deduction conditions are met |
| Interest on land acquisition during construction | Check s 26-102 vacant-land restrictions and exclusions separately. Trace and apportion combined loans. Consider cost base only for amounts denied a deduction and otherwise eligible |

### 2.8 CGT on Disposal

**CGT on Disposal Elements**

| Element | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Cost base | Purchase price + stamp duty + legal fees + capital improvements - Div 43 deductions claimed |
| Capital proceeds | Sale price - agent commission - legal fees on sale |
| Net capital gain | Proceeds - cost base |
| 50% CGT discount | Available if held 12+ months (individuals/trusts only) |
| Main residence exemption (partial) | Available if property was main residence for part of ownership period |
| 6-year absence rule | Treat as main residence for up to 6 years of absence if no other main residence claimed |
| Non-residents | Work out preserved discount entitlement for qualifying resident periods and any pre-8 May 2012 rules; see au-nonresident-cgt |

### 2.9 Non-Resident Rental Withholding

**Non-Resident Rental Withholding Rules**  _([ATO, FRCGW](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/foreign-resident-capital-gains-withholding))_

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Applies to | Non-resident landlords receiving Australian rental income |
| Rate | Payer (tenant/agent) must withhold amounts as directed by ATO |
| FRCGW (foreign resident CGT withholding) | For contracts signed from 1 January 2025, 15% of the sale price on all Australian real property, with no value threshold. For contracts from 1 July 2017 to 31 December 2024, 12.5% where the value was $750,000 or more. [ATO, FRCGW](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/capital-gains-tax/foreign-residents-and-capital-gains-tax/foreign-resident-capital-gains-withholding) |
| Clearance certificate | An Australian resident vendor obtains one and gives it to the purchaser before settlement to avoid FRCGW. Apply for it early; processing is not immediate |
| Variation | A foreign resident vendor can apply for a variation where 15% exceeds the expected Australian tax on the sale |

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Gross Rental Income

- **Gross Rental Income** — Sum all assessable rental receipts for the financial year.

### Step 2: Immediate Deductions

- **Immediate Deductions** — Sum all allowable expenses (interest, rates, insurance, management fees, repairs, body corporate, etc.).

### Step 3: Depreciation (Div 40 + Div 43)

- **Depreciation** — Add capital works deduction (2.5% of construction cost) and plant depreciation (per ATO effective life schedules).

### Step 4: Net Rental Income / Loss

- **Net Rental Income / Loss** — Gross income − deductions − depreciation = net rental income (or loss if negative gearing).

### Step 5: Report on Tax Return

- **Reporting outcome** — Positive: included in assessable income and taxed at marginal rates. Negative: offsets other assessable income (salary, business) dollar-for-dollar.

## Section 5 -- Filing Requirements

**Filing Requirements**

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Form | Individual Tax Return (ITR) -- Rental Property Schedule (Item 21) |
| Reporting | Per-property basis (complete separate schedule for each property) |
| Joint ownership | Each co-owner reports their share (typically 50/50 for joint tenants) |
| Records retention | 5 years from date of lodgement (longer if CGT applies -- keep until 5 years after disposal) |
| Quantity surveyor report | Recommended for all post-1985 properties to substantiate Div 43 and Div 40 claims |

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Property Vacant

- **Vacancy deduction rule** — Expenses are deductible during vacancy ONLY if the property is genuinely available for rent (advertised, not restricted in availability). If withheld from the market (e.g., reserved for personal use or holiday), deductions are denied for that period.

### 6.2 Part-Year Rental / Part-Private Use

- **Apportionment rule** — Apportion all expenses on a time basis (days rented or available ÷ 365). Interest remains fully deductible if the property was available for the full year even if vacant.
- **Co-owners and domestic arrangements** — Co-owners allocate income and expenses by their legal interests; one owner paying the bills does not change the split. A partnership carrying on a rental business needs separate analysis, and sharing household costs with a family member is not automatically a commercial rental arrangement.  _([ATO, Rental income you must declare](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-income-you-must-declare))_

### 6.3 Holiday Homes

- **Holiday home deduction limitation** — If the property is available for rent at below-market rates, or restricted to holiday periods only, or rented to relatives at reduced rates -- deductions are limited to income received (no negative gearing). ATO scrutinises holiday letting closely.
- **Section 26-50 leisure facilities** — Section 26-50 denies expenses associated with owning or using a leisure facility unless it is used or held mainly to produce assessable income. Offering a holiday home for a few rental weeks does not meet that requirement; keep advertisements, agent agreements, booking records and evidence of commercially realistic rent and tenant access.
- **TR 2026/1 and the 2026 compliance guidelines** — TR 2026/1 sets out when rental receipts are assessable, when outgoings are deductible and how to apportion mixed use for individuals not in business. PCG 2026/2 gives the apportionment methods the ATO accepts, and PCG 2026/3 its compliance approach to section 26-50 for holiday homes that are also let. Read them before claiming a loss on a property with any private use.  _([ATO, What's new in the rental properties guide 2026](https://www.ato.gov.au/forms-and-instructions/rental-properties-2026/whats-new-in-the-rental-properties-guide); [ITAA 1997 (Cth) s 26-50](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=PAC/19970038/26-50); [ATO, How to claim rental expenses](https://www.ato.gov.au/individuals-and-families/investments-and-assets/property-and-land/residential-rental-properties/rental-expenses/how-to-claim-rental-expenses))_

### 6.4 Subdivision and Development

- **Subdivision profit treatment** — If a rental property is subdivided, the profit on sale of subdivided lots may be ordinary income (not CGT) if the taxpayer has a profit-making intention. Escalate to specialist.

### 6.5 Deceased Estates

- **Deceased estate rental treatment** — Rental property passing through an estate: the legal personal representative (LPR) reports rental income in the estate return until the property is transferred to a beneficiary. CGT is deferred until the beneficiary disposes.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions** — NEVER claim travel to a residential rental property as a deduction (removed from 1 July 2017 for non-business landlords); NEVER claim Div 40 plant depreciation for a subsequent owner of residential property (post-2017 rule) unless the asset was newly installed by that owner; NEVER claim Div 43 without evidence of construction cost (quantity surveyor report or original builder records); NEVER deduct loan principal repayments; NEVER deduct expenses relating to periods of genuine private use without apportionment; Calculate a foreign resident's retained CGT discount entitlement from residency and acquisition history; NEVER omit prior Div 43 deductions from the cost base on disposal (reduces cost base); NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated

## Section 8 -- Which tax applies, and where its rules live

A property transaction can touch four separate regimes at once. Work out which apply before
calculating anything, because the answer to one changes the inputs to another.

### 8.1 Decision table by event

**Decision table by event**

| Event | Income tax | GST | CGT | State or territory |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Buying a residential investment property | Borrowing costs, and holding costs once available for rent | Generally input taxed on an existing residential premises, so no credit on the purchase. New residential premises may be taxable and may trigger GST at settlement | Establishes the cost base | Transfer duty, and possibly foreign purchaser surcharge duty |
| Holding and renting it out | Rental income assessable, deductions under Section 2, Div 40 and Div 43 | Residential rent is input taxed, so no GST on rent and no credits on expenses | Deductions claimed under Div 43 reduce the cost base | Land tax, and possibly a foreign owner or vacancy surcharge |
| Renovating | Repair deductible, improvement capital | Credits depend on whether the premises remain input taxed | Capital work enters the cost base or Div 43 | Nil, unless it changes the land tax position |
| Short-stay or holiday letting | Apportionment for private use and periods not genuinely available | Commercial residential premises can be taxable rather than input taxed. Test this, do not assume | Main residence exemption can be lost or reduced | Some jurisdictions apply short-stay levies |
| Buying or holding a commercial property | Rent assessable, deductions available | Generally taxable, so GST on rent and credits on expenses, subject to registration. A going concern or margin scheme may apply on sale | Cost base as normal | Transfer duty and land tax |
| Selling | Balancing adjustments on Div 40 assets | See `au-gst-property.md`. GST at settlement can require the purchaser to withhold | The CGT calculation. See `au-capital-gains.md` | Duty is payable by the purchaser, not the vendor |
| Selling as a foreign resident | Rental income to the date of sale | As above | No full 50% discount, and the main residence exemption is generally unavailable | As above |

### 8.2 The GST decision path

1. **Is the supply residential premises?** Existing residential premises are input taxed: no GST
   on the sale or the rent, and no credits on related acquisitions.
2. **Are they new residential premises?** New residential premises are generally taxable, which
   changes both the GST on sale and the purchaser's withholding obligation at settlement.
3. **Are they commercial residential premises?** Hotels, motels and similar are taxable, not input
   taxed. Short-stay accommodation sits near this boundary and needs the actual facts.
4. **Is it commercial property?** Generally taxable, subject to registration and turnover.
5. **Does an entity-level test change the answer?** Registration, the $75,000 threshold, and
   whether the activity amounts to an enterprise all sit upstream of the supply classification.
6. **Does a special rule apply on sale?** The margin scheme, the going concern exemption and GST
   at settlement each have their own conditions.

The full rules are in `au-gst-property.md` and `australia-gst.md`. Do not decide a property GST
question from this file alone.

### 8.3 State and territory taxes are not federal, and are not uniform

Land tax, transfer duty, foreign purchaser and foreign owner surcharges, and vacancy or short-stay
levies are imposed by each state and territory under its own Act. Thresholds, rates, exemptions,
aggregation rules, trust surcharges and the definition of a principal place of residence all
differ. A rule from one jurisdiction must never be applied to another.

Establish the jurisdiction first, then read that jurisdiction's own guidance:

Land tax paid on an income-producing property is generally deductible in the year it is incurred.
Transfer duty on the purchase is not deductible; it is a cost base element. See `au-land-tax.md`
and `au-stamp-duty.md` for the jurisdiction-specific detail.
