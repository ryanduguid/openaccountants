name: sa-return-assembly
description: >
  Use this skill whenever asked to assemble, finalize, or package a Saudi Arabian annual tax return
  or Zakat declaration. Trigger on phrases like "Saudi return assembly", "ZATCA submission",
  "Saudi annual filing", "120-day deadline Saudi", "Zakat declaration", "Saudi CIT return",
  "assemble Saudi return", "finalize KSA return", "Saudi working paper", or "ZATCA filing package".
  This is the capstone orchestrator that pulls together outputs from sa-zakat, sa-corporate-tax,
  sa-withholding-tax, sa-rett, sa-gosi-saudization, sa-excise-tax, sa-formation, saudi-arabia-vat,
  and saudi-einvoice into a single unified working paper plus payment and filing instructions.
  It does not recompute anything itself — it reconciles upstream outputs, builds the line-by-line
  ZATCA working paper, generates SADAD billing instructions for ZATCA portal payment, and produces
  a reviewer brief and taxpayer action list. ALWAYS read this skill last when finalizing a Saudi
  tax return or Zakat declaration.

# Saudi Arabia — Return Assembly (Capstone) — Skill v1.0

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, the user has already passed through intake and the relevant content skills. They want their finished ZATCA working paper. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

Specifically:

- **Do NOT ask "do you want me to assemble the full package".** The user asked for the return. Produce it.
- **Do NOT re-interrogate the user about residency, CR number, TIN, or ownership structure** — intake already captured this; trust the upstream packages.
- **Do NOT pause between reconciliation steps to check in.** Run all cross-checks in sequence; flag failures in the reviewer brief and continue.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** If a check fails, note it under "Reviewer Attention Flags" and continue.
- **Do NOT submit anything to ZATCA.** This skill produces a working paper plus filing instructions. A credentialed reviewer (SOCPA member, or recognised ICAEW / ACCA / US CPA practising in KSA) must review, and the taxpayer (or authorised representative) submits via the ZATCA portal.

**If you feel the urge to ask "how should I proceed", pick the most defensible path, proceed, and flag the decision for the reviewer.**

## What this file is

The final capstone skill for Saudi Arabian annual tax filings. It consumes the outputs of every other Saudi skill and assembles a single unified working paper covering one of:

- **Zakat declaration** — Saudi-owned and GCC-owned entities under Royal Decree No. M/40 (1405 AH) and the Implementing Regulations for Zakat Collection issued by ZATCA
- **Corporate Income Tax return (Form 800 series)** — foreign-owned (non-Saudi / non-GCC) entities under the Income Tax Law (Royal Decree No. M/1 of 1425 AH) and its Implementing Regulations
- **Mixed-entity return** — joint Saudi / foreign ownership; Zakat applied to the Saudi/GCC share, CIT applied to the foreign share, on a single combined return

The output is a reviewer-ready package: line-by-line ZATCA working paper, cross-skill reconciliation table, payment instructions (ZATCA portal → SADAD billing ID → Saudi bank channel), filing instructions, reviewer checklist, taxpayer action list, WPS / Saudization compliance check, and 2026 planning notes.

## Section 2 — Required inputs from upstream SA skills

The assembly skill does not recompute anything. It expects structured outputs from the following upstream Saudi skills. If an upstream skill did not run, the assembly notes the gap and continues with available data.

### 2.1 Entity-type matrix — which upstream skills feed which return

| Entity ownership | Annual filing | Upstream skills consumed |
|---|---|---|
| 100% Saudi / GCC-owned | Zakat declaration only | sa-zakat, saudi-arabia-vat, sa-withholding-tax, sa-gosi-saudization, sa-formation, saudi-einvoice |
| 100% foreign-owned | CIT return (Form 800) | sa-corporate-tax, saudi-arabia-vat, sa-withholding-tax, sa-gosi-saudization, sa-formation, saudi-einvoice |
| Mixed (Saudi/GCC + foreign) | Combined Zakat + CIT return — proportional split by ownership | sa-zakat AND sa-corporate-tax, plus all others |
| Listed on Tadawul with mixed shareholders | Combined Zakat + CIT — proportional by free float | sa-zakat AND sa-corporate-tax, plus others |
| Real estate disposer in the year | + RETT computation | sa-rett |
| Excise-taxable goods (tobacco, sugary drinks, energy drinks, soft drinks, sweetened beverages, e-cigarettes, electronic devices for vaping) | + Excise return | sa-excise-tax |

### 2.2 Zakat declaration — inputs

| Upstream skill | Output consumed | Where it lands on the Zakat declaration |
|---|---|---|
| `sa-zakat` | Zakat base computation: equity-method base (capital + retained earnings + reserves + long-term liabilities − long-term assets − adjustments) OR Zakat-on-profit base where lower; 2.5% Zakat rate (or 2.577% Hijri-year conversion); working capital adjustments | Main Zakat base schedule; Zakat liability line |
| `saudi-arabia-vat` | VAT-registered turnover; output VAT and input VAT positions (cross-check only) | Cross-check vs. revenue in financial statements |
| `sa-withholding-tax` | WHT suffered (rare for Saudi/GCC entities other than payments from abroad) and WHT agent obligations on payments to non-residents (5%/15%/20% by category) | WHT credits schedule; agent compliance check |
| `sa-gosi-saudization` | GOSI contributions (employer + employee), Saudization tier (Nitaqat: Platinum / High Green / Medium Green / Low Green / Yellow / Red), WPS file submissions via Mudad | Salary & wage schedule; compliance attestation |
| `sa-rett` | Real estate transaction tax paid on disposals during the year (5% RETT) | Disclosure schedule; not Zakat-deductible |
| `sa-excise-tax` | Excise paid and collected on taxable goods | Cross-check only — separate return |
| `sa-formation` | Entity structure: Commercial Registration (CR) number, TIN, MoC registration, shareholders' nationality split, paid-up capital | Identification block; ownership split for mixed entities |
| `saudi-einvoice` | E-invoicing compliance status (Fatoorah Phase 1 generation + Phase 2 integration with ZATCA) | Compliance attestation |

### 2.3 CIT return (foreign-owned entities) — inputs

| Upstream skill | Output consumed | Where it lands on the CIT return |
|---|---|---|
| `sa-corporate-tax` | CIT computation: accounting profit → taxable income via tax adjustments; CIT at 20% (general rate); 85% rate for upstream oil & gas; 30%–85% rate for natural gas investment field; permanent establishment determination | Form 800 — main computation; tax adjustments schedule; depreciation schedule (under SA Income Tax Law Implementing Regulations) |
| `sa-withholding-tax` | WHT suffered (rare) and WHT agent obligations on payments to non-residents (5% royalties / 15% management fees / 20% other / 5% dividends / 5% interest — per ITL Art. 68) | Tax credits schedule; agent compliance check |
| `saudi-arabia-vat` | Output and input VAT; VAT return reconciliation | Cross-check vs. revenue |
| `sa-gosi-saudization` | Employee GOSI, salary expense, Saudization tier compliance | Salary schedule; compliance attestation |
| `sa-rett` | RETT paid on disposals (deductible or capitalised per accounting policy) | Disclosure schedule |
| `sa-excise-tax` | Excise tax paid / collected | Cross-check only |
| `sa-formation` | CR number, TIN, MoC registration, shareholders' nationality, paid-up capital | Identification block |
| `saudi-einvoice` | Fatoorah compliance status | Compliance attestation |

### 2.4 Mixed-entity return — proportional split

For entities with mixed Saudi/GCC and foreign ownership:

| Calculation step | Treatment |
|---|---|
| 1. Compute the Zakat base (equity method) | Per sa-zakat |
| 2. Compute the CIT taxable income | Per sa-corporate-tax |
| 3. Determine ownership split | From sa-formation (cap table at year-end) |
| 4. Apply Zakat to Saudi/GCC share of Zakat base × 2.5% | Zakat portion |
| 5. Apply CIT to foreign share of CIT taxable income × 20% (or applicable rate) | CIT portion |
| 6. Add WHT agent obligations | Same for both portions |
| 7. Combined liability on a single return submitted via ZATCA portal | One submission |

### 2.5 Intake-required identifiers

| Identifier | Required for |
|---|---|
| Commercial Registration (CR) number — issued by Ministry of Commerce | All entities |
| Tax Identification Number (TIN) — issued by ZATCA | All entities |
| VAT registration number — 15 digits ending in `03` | If VAT-registered |
| ZATCA portal credentials (username + password + nafath / IAM) | All electronic submissions |
| MoC commercial registration certificate | All entities |
| Shareholders' nationality split (Saudi / GCC / foreign) | Mixed-entity determination |
| Fiscal year-end date | Determines 120-day deadline |
| Audited financial statements (where threshold met) | All entities above the SAR 40M revenue threshold (or other ZATCA-specified thresholds) |
| GOSI employer registration | All entities with employees |
| Mudad subscription (WPS platform) | All entities with employees |
| Nitaqat tier (Saudization) | Entities with 5+ employees |
| Saudi Customs importer / exporter identifier | If applicable |

If any identifier is missing, the assembly skill flags it as "Needs Input" and produces the working paper with placeholders rather than halting.

## Section 3 — Assembly workflow

The capstone runs in eight phases. Each phase reads upstream output, runs reconciliation, and writes a section of the master working paper.

### 3.1 Phase 1 — Read intake & confirm scope

- Confirm entity type: Saudi/GCC-owned / foreign-owned / mixed
- Confirm fiscal year-end (Gregorian default; Hijri or custom by ZATCA approval)
- Compute the 120-day deadline from FYE
- Confirm whether RETT, Excise apply
- Confirm VAT periodicity (monthly if turnover > SAR 40M; otherwise quarterly)

### 3.2 Phase 2 — Ownership split (for mixed entities)

- Read cap table from sa-formation
- Classify each shareholder as Saudi / GCC / foreign
- Compute Saudi+GCC % and foreign %
- Carry to mixed-entity computation

### 3.3 Phase 3 — Zakat base or CIT taxable income

For Saudi/GCC-owned (Zakat only):
- Read Zakat base from sa-zakat (equity method or Zakat-on-profit, whichever lower under Implementing Regulations Art. 5)
- Apply 2.5% rate (Gregorian) or 2.577% (Hijri-year filers)

For foreign-owned (CIT only):
- Read CIT taxable income from sa-corporate-tax
- Apply 20% general rate (or specialised rates: 85% upstream petroleum; 30% natural gas)
- Apply interest deduction limitation: 50% of EBITDA per ITL Art. 12 / Implementing Regulations
- Apply carry-forward loss rules: 25% annual cap per year against current-year income, no time limit on the loss

For mixed:
- Compute both bases independently
- Apply proportional ownership split

### 3.4 Phase 4 — Withholding tax compliance

- Read WHT agent obligations from sa-withholding-tax
- Verify monthly WHT returns filed within 10 days of month-end for each month of the year
- Reconcile total WHT remitted vs. total payments to non-residents × applicable rate
- Common rates (ITL Art. 68):
  - Royalties: 15%
  - Management / consulting fees to non-resident: 20% (5% if related party — verify)
  - Dividends to non-resident: 5%
  - Interest to non-resident: 5%
  - Technical / consulting services: 5%
  - Rent: 5%
  - Other: 15% or 20% (verify per category)

### 3.5 Phase 5 — VAT reconciliation

- Annual VAT-able revenue per saudi-arabia-vat should equal financial statement revenue (after standard reconciling items: zero-rated exports, exempt items, output adjustments)
- Annual output VAT vs. sum of monthly/quarterly returns
- Annual input VAT vs. sum of returns
- Net VAT position: refundable or payable

### 3.6 Phase 6 — GOSI, Saudization, WPS

- Read GOSI contributions from sa-gosi-saudization
- Confirm WPS files submitted via Mudad for every month of the year
- Confirm Nitaqat tier (Platinum / High Green / Medium Green / Low Green / Yellow / Red) for entities with 5+ employees
- Yellow/Red tier flags consequences: visa restrictions, work permit renewal issues, ZATCA may flag the file

### 3.7 Phase 7 — RETT and Excise (if applicable)

- RETT: per sa-rett — 5% of real estate disposal value, paid at notarisation; disclosure only on the annual return
- Excise: per sa-excise-tax — bi-monthly returns; annual reconciliation
  - Tobacco: 100%
  - Soft drinks: 50%
  - Energy drinks: 100%
  - Sweetened beverages: 50%
  - Electronic smoking devices: 100%

### 3.8 Phase 8 — Final assembly

- Build master Excel workbook
- Write reviewer brief
- Write taxpayer action list
- Generate SADAD billing register
- Generate 2026 planning notes

---

## Section 4 — Working paper structure (for credentialed reviewer)

The reviewer is a **SOCPA member** (Saudi Organization for Chartered Public Accountants) or a recognised foreign credential practising in KSA — **ICAEW (UK)**, **ACCA**, or **US CPA**. They sign off before ZATCA submission. SOCPA is the primary local credential; foreign credentials are accepted by ZATCA for international firms and joint ventures.

| Phase 1 generation (since 4 December 2021) | All B2B and B2C invoices generated electronically | Compliance check |
| Phase 2 integration with ZATCA (rolled out in waves) | If wave is in scope, integration confirmed | Compliance check; if not yet in wave, note expected wave |
| QR code on each invoice | Mandatory | Spot-check sample |

**Cross-check 8 — Working capital / Zakat adjustments**

| Source | Figure | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Long-term liabilities (added to Zakat base) | Per sa-zakat | Anchor |
| Long-term assets (deducted from Zakat base) | Per sa-zakat | Anchor |
| Inventory financed by short-term borrowing | Per sa-zakat | Adjustment per Implementing Regulations |
| Provisions for doubtful debts | Per sa-zakat | Add-back rules per Implementing Regulations |

**Cross-check 9 — Tolerance discipline**

For Zakat / CIT base computation: SAR 100 default tolerance. For larger entities (> SAR 40M revenue): SAR 1,000 tolerance. Discrepancies between SAR 100 and SAR 10,000 — flag and proceed. Above SAR 10,000 — raise as "Needs Input" before sign-off.

### 5.4 Refund treatment

If net is refundable: claim is made on the ZATCA portal. Refunds are processed under the Tax Procedures Law; typical processing time 30–60 days, longer if ZATCA selects for audit.

If net is payable: must be settled via SADAD billing before the 120-day deadline (see Section 6).

---

## Section 6 — Payment instructions — ZATCA portal, SADAD billing

All Saudi tax payments flow through the ZATCA portal → SADAD billing mechanism.

### 6.1 The ZATCA → SADAD flow

1. **Log into ZATCA portal** at https://zatca.gov.sa with TIN + password (or via Nafath / national IAM)
2. **Navigate to "Returns and Payments"** → select the relevant return (Zakat / CIT / VAT / WHT / Excise)
3. **Submit the return** — the portal computes the liability based on entries; verify against the working paper
4. **Generate SADAD bill** — ZATCA issues a **SADAD billing ID** (numeric, typically 14 digits or as currently formatted)
5. **Pay via Saudi bank channel** — present the SADAD billing ID via:
   - **Internet banking** — every Saudi bank has a SADAD payment tab; select biller "ZATCA" / "Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority" → enter billing ID → pay
   - **Mobile banking app** — same flow
   - **SADAD-enabled ATM** — select SADAD payments → ZATCA → enter billing ID
   - **Bank branch teller** — present billing ID for over-the-counter payment
6. **Payment receipt** — bank issues a SADAD payment confirmation; the payment auto-feeds to ZATCA's records against the TIN
7. **Verify in ZATCA portal** — payment status updates from "Pending" to "Paid"

### 6.2 Common tax heads / SADAD bill mapping

| Tax head | ZATCA portal section | Periodicity | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Zakat | Annual Zakat declaration | Annual (120 days from FYE) | Saudi/GCC entities |
| Corporate Income Tax | Annual CIT (Form 800) | Annual (120 days from FYE) | Foreign-owned entities |
| Mixed Zakat + CIT | Annual combined | Annual (120 days from FYE) | Mixed-ownership entities |
| VAT | Monthly or quarterly | 28th of following month | All VAT-registered |
| Withholding Tax | Monthly | Within 10 days of month-end | All WHT agents |
| Excise Tax | Bi-monthly | Within 15 days of period-end | Excise-able goods |
| RETT | Transaction-by-transaction | At notarisation | Real estate disposers |

### 6.3 Payment timing relative to filing

| Payment | Due date | Filing reference |
|---|---|---|
| Annual Zakat / CIT balance | **Within 120 days of FYE** (for 31 Dec FYE → 30 April 2026) | Annual return |
| Monthly VAT (turnover > SAR 40M) | 28th of following month | VAT return |
| Quarterly VAT (turnover ≤ SAR 40M) | 28th of month following quarter | VAT return |
| Monthly WHT | Within 10 days of month-end | WHT return |
| Bi-monthly Excise | Within 15 days of period-end | Excise return |
| RETT | At notarisation | Transactional |

**Rule:** The SADAD billing payment must be settled by the deadline. The annual return submission and the payment can be done in the same session via the portal.

### 6.4 Penalties for late payment / filing

| Item | Penalty | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late payment of any tax (Zakat / CIT / VAT / WHT / Excise) | 1% of unpaid amount per month (or part of month) | Tax Procedures Law and Zakat Implementing Regulations |
| Late filing of annual return | 5%–25% of tax due depending on delay band | Tax Procedures Law |
| Late VAT return | 5%–25% of VAT due | VAT Implementing Regulations |
| Late WHT remittance | 1% per month plus penalty 1%–25% | ITL Implementing Regulations |
| False declaration / evasion | Up to 25% of underpaid amount plus criminal exposure under Anti-Evasion provisions | Tax Procedures Law |

## Section 7 — Filing instructions — annual return within 120 days of FYE via ZATCA

### 7.1 Filing channel

All Saudi annual tax filings are submitted electronically through the **ZATCA portal** at https://zatca.gov.sa. Paper filings are not accepted for normal taxpayers.

### 7.2 Submission steps

1. **Confirm CR / TIN validity** — both must be active in MoC and ZATCA records
2. **Prepare audited financial statements** if required (entities above SAR 40M revenue typically must attach audited FS signed by a SOCPA-licensed auditor)
3. **Log into ZATCA portal** with TIN + password / Nafath
4. **Navigate to "Returns and Payments"** → select "Annual Zakat/Tax Return"
5. **Choose the form**:
   - Zakat declaration form (for Saudi/GCC)
   - CIT Form 800 series (for foreign-owned)
   - Combined declaration (for mixed)
6. **Enter the computation** using the working paper as source
7. **Upload attachments**:
   - Audited financial statements (SOCPA-signed)
   - Auditor's report
   - Cap table at FYE (mixed entities)
   - Supporting schedules as required
8. **Validate** — portal runs arithmetic and schema checks; resolve errors
9. **Submit** — receive ZATCA acknowledgement with submission reference and timestamp
10. **Generate SADAD bill** for payable amount
11. **Pay via Saudi bank channel** (per Section 6)
12. **Save acknowledgement and SADAD payment confirmation** — legal proof of filing and payment

### 7.3 Deadlines (illustrative — adjust to actual FYE)

| Fiscal year-end | 120-day deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 31 December 2025 | **30 April 2026** | Most common Gregorian filers |
| 31 March 2026 | **29 July 2026** | Some entities |
| 30 June 2026 | **28 October 2026** | Hijri-aligned filers |
| 30 September 2026 | **28 January 2027** | Some entities |
| Custom year-end approved by ZATCA | FYE + 120 days | Per approval |

For Hijri-year filers, the 120 days runs from the Hijri year-end and is converted to Gregorian for portal submission.

### 7.4 Extension of time

| Item | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Extension request | Application to ZATCA before deadline, citing grounds (typically audit delay or major operational disruption) |
| Typical extension | 30 days; rarely more |
| Penalty during extension | Late payment penalty (1% per month) still accrues unless ZATCA grants a payment moratorium |

### 7.5 Audit & assessment

ZATCA may select returns for audit within 5 years of filing (per Tax Procedures Law). Triggers include:

- Significant book-to-tax adjustments
- Loss carry-forward usage
- Related-party transactions (transfer pricing — Saudi adopts OECD-aligned TP rules; Local File / Master File / CbCR thresholds apply)
- Refund claims
- Industry-specific risk profiling

---

## Section 8 — WPS + Saudization compliance check

This section is critical because ZATCA increasingly cross-references labor compliance with tax filings, and Yellow/Red Nitaqat tier is flagged on the entity's file.

### 8.1 WPS (Wage Protection System) via Mudad

Every entity with employees must:
- Submit monthly WPS file via the **Mudad** platform (https://mudad.com.sa)
- Confirm all employees received salary via authorised bank channel
- Submit no later than the salary disbursement deadline (typically 3 days after the salary date)

**Capstone check:** Confirm 12 monthly WPS files were submitted for the year. If any gap, flag as a "Reviewer Attention" item — gaps in WPS are a compliance violation under Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) regulations and can result in:
- Visa block on the company
- Suspension of work permit renewals
- Civil penalties

### 8.2 Saudization — Nitaqat tier

The Nitaqat program tracks Saudi national employment as a percentage of total workforce. Tiers (current framework):

| Tier | Status | Implications |
|---|---|---|
| Platinum | Best | Maximum benefits; expedited services |
| High Green | High compliance | Normal services; favoured for govt contracts |
| Medium Green | Compliant | Normal services |
| Low Green | Compliant but marginal | Normal services; warning zone |
| Yellow | Non-compliant | Visa restrictions; cannot renew certain work permits |
| Red | Severely non-compliant | Severe visa/work permit restrictions; major risk for operations |

**Capstone check:** Confirm Nitaqat tier per sa-gosi-saudization. If Yellow or Red, raise as a "Reviewer Attention" item — does not block the tax filing but is a major operational risk.

### 8.3 GOSI confirmation

- Confirm GOSI monthly contributions paid for all 12 months
- Confirm employee numbers reconcile to financial statement salary expense
- Saudi nationals: employer contribution 11.75% (current rates — verify at filing time); employee 9.75%; unemployment insurance (SANED) 1%/1%
- Non-Saudi: employer occupational hazard only — 2% (current rate — verify)

### 8.4 Attestation block

The reviewer brief must include:

```
[ ] All 12 monthly WPS files submitted via Mudad
[ ] All 12 monthly GOSI returns filed and paid
[ ] Nitaqat tier confirmed as: ______________
[ ] No outstanding labor violations flagged with MHRSD
[ ] Employee count reconciles to financial statements
```

## Section 9 — Year-end planning notes

### 9.1 Zakat working capital optimisation (Saudi/GCC entities)

The Zakat base under the equity method includes:
- Long-term liabilities (added)
- Long-term assets (deducted)

Strategic planning at FYE:
- Accelerate qualifying long-term asset purchases before FYE to reduce Zakat base
- Convert short-term debt to long-term (over 1 year) to add to Zakat base — but watch other consequences
- Time inventory write-downs and provisions per Implementing Regulations
- Consider Zakat-on-profit method comparison — whichever is lower applies

### 9.2 CIT interest deduction limit (foreign entities)

ITL Article 12 / Implementing Regulations cap interest deduction at 50% of EBITDA. Planning items:
- Forecast EBITDA and interest expense before FYE
- Consider thin-cap restructuring if interest exceeds the cap
- Carry-forward of denied interest: verify current rules in sa-corporate-tax

### 9.3 WHT exemption certificates

For payments to non-residents in treaty countries (Saudi Arabia has 50+ DTAs):
- Apply for WHT exemption / reduced rate certificate before payment
- ZATCA processes certificate applications via the portal
- Without certificate, full statutory WHT applies; refund claim possible but cash-tied-up for months

### 9.4 Saudization workforce planning

- Plan Nitaqat tier maintenance for 2026: hire Saudi nationals, train, retain
- Use programs like HRDF / HADAF subsidies for Saudi training
- Forecast Saudi national % by quarter to avoid tier drop

### 9.5 VAT periodicity transition

If turnover crosses SAR 40M threshold, periodicity becomes mandatory monthly. Plan:
- Internal controls upgrade for monthly close
- Reconciliation cadence
- E-invoicing Phase 2 wave inclusion check

### 9.6 E-Invoicing Phase 2 waves

ZATCA continues to phase in Phase 2 integration in waves. Each wave is announced by ZATCA with a target date. Confirm:
- Has the entity received the wave notification?
- Is integration with ZATCA infrastructure complete?
- Is the entity exchanging cryptographic stamps / UUIDs correctly?

### 9.7 RETT planning

If real estate disposals are planned in 2026:
- RETT 5% on disposal value, paid at notarisation
- RETT replaced VAT on real estate from 4 October 2020
- Some exemptions (gifts between first-degree relatives, certain inheritance, etc.) — verify per sa-rett

### 9.8 Transfer pricing / BEPS

Saudi adopted OECD-aligned TP rules; entities meeting thresholds must prepare:
- Local File
- Master File
- Country-by-Country Report (CbCR) — for MNEs above SAR 3.2 billion consolidated revenue

Not assembled here; reference via sa-corporate-tax.

## Section 12 — Refusals

**R-SA-ASM-1 — Upstream skill did not run.** Name the missing skill. Continue with available data; flag the gap; do not fabricate the missing computation.

**R-SA-ASM-2 — Upstream self-check failed.** Note the specific check; continue but flag.

**R-SA-ASM-3 — Cross-skill reconciliation > SAR 10,000.** Raise as "Needs Input"; do not silently round.

**R-SA-ASM-4 — Out of scope: upstream petroleum (Aramco-style 85% rate regime), natural gas investment (30%–85% bands), banking under SAMA-regulated specialised regimes, insurance specialised regimes, listed Tadawul-specific reporting requirements beyond the standard ownership split, qualified investment funds (QIFs) under special regimes, Real Estate Investment Traded Funds (REITs) under specialised CMA rules, Special Economic Zones (Riyadh ITSEZ, Jazan, Ras Al-Khair, Cloud Computing Special Economic Zone, Special Integrated Logistics Zone), Regional Headquarters (RHQ) tax incentive regime, and entities in NEOM / Red Sea Global / Qiddiya with specialised arrangements.** Flag for human specialist; do not attempt.

**R-SA-ASM-5 — Out of scope: PE-only filings for non-resident contractors operating without local CR; pure-play offshore service permanent establishments under treaty-protected positions; transfer pricing assessments for MNEs above CbCR threshold (handled via sa-corporate-tax with specialist support); APA negotiations with ZATCA.** Refer to a specialist.

**R-SA-ASM-6 — Intake incomplete.** Name the missing intake field (CR, TIN, VAT number, ownership split, fiscal year-end, audited FS, GOSI ID, Mudad subscription). Cannot finalise the return until provided.

**R-SA-ASM-7 — Asked to submit to ZATCA.** This skill produces a working paper. Submission is the taxpayer's (or their authorised representative's) action, after credentialed reviewer sign-off. Decline politely; provide the filing instructions instead.

**R-SA-ASM-8 — Asked to confirm rates / thresholds without verification against current ZATCA regulations.** Defer to sa-zakat / sa-corporate-tax / saudi-arabia-vat which carry the verified current-period figures. Flag any figure used here as "verify against current upstream skill output".

**R-SA-ASM-9 — Asked to opine on Sharia compliance of Zakat base treatment.** Decline — Sharia interpretation is the role of the entity's Sharia board or qualified scholar; the capstone applies ZATCA's Implementing Regulations as published, not independent Sharia analysis.

---

## Section 13 — Self-checks

**Check SA-ASM-1** — All upstream skills required for the chosen return type have produced output, or the gap is flagged.

**Check SA-ASM-2** — Ownership split is correctly classified between Saudi/GCC and foreign for mixed entities, with cap table support.

**Check SA-ASM-3** — Zakat base (equity method) reconciles to the financial statements equity section; long-term liabilities and long-term assets correctly identified.

**Check SA-ASM-4** — CIT taxable income reconciles from accounting profit through documented tax adjustments with ITL section references.

**Check SA-ASM-5** — Interest deduction limit (50% of EBITDA per ITL Art. 12) is tested and applied if breached.

**Check SA-ASM-6** — All 12 monthly WHT returns are confirmed filed; each has a SADAD billing ID and payment confirmation.

**Check SA-ASM-7** — VAT reconciliation: annual revenue ties to sum of monthly/quarterly VAT returns ± documented reconciling items.

**Check SA-ASM-8** — All 12 monthly WPS files via Mudad are confirmed submitted.

**Check SA-ASM-9** — Nitaqat tier is identified; if Yellow or Red, raised as a Reviewer Attention item.

**Check SA-ASM-10** — Audited financial statements are attached where threshold met (SAR 40M+ revenue or other ZATCA-specified threshold).

**Check SA-ASM-11** — RETT disclosures are present for any real estate disposals during the year.

**Check SA-ASM-12** — Excise reconciliation is present if entity deals in excise-able goods.

**Check SA-ASM-13** — Fatoorah (e-invoicing) Phase 1 compliance confirmed; Phase 2 integration confirmed where wave applies.

**Check SA-ASM-14** — 120-day deadline is explicitly stated in the action list with the correct calendar date computed from FYE.

**Check SA-ASM-15** — SADAD billing register lists every payable item with billing ID, amount, and payment status.

**Check SA-ASM-16** — Record retention period (6 years per Tax Procedures Law) is stated in the action list.

**Check SA-ASM-17** — Reviewer brief contains legislation citations (Royal Decree numbers, ITL articles, Zakat IR articles, VAT IR articles, RETT framework) for every position taken.

**Check SA-ASM-18** — Credentialed reviewer (SOCPA / ICAEW / ACCA / US CPA) sign-off requirement is stated in the executive summary, attestation block, and action list.

**Check SA-ASM-19** — For mixed entities, Saudi/GCC% × Zakat base × 2.5% PLUS foreign% × taxable income × applicable CIT rate equals the combined liability on the return.

**Check SA-ASM-20** — WHT rates applied per ITL Art. 68 (5% royalties / 15% management / 20% other / 5% dividends / 5% interest / 5% rent / 5% technical services — confirm against current upstream).

## Section 14 — Output files

The final output is **three files**:

1. **`[entity_slug]_FY2025_sa_master.xlsx`** — Master workbook. Sheets per Section 4.1. Use live formulas where possible; verify no `#REF!` errors.

2. **`reviewer_brief.md`** — Markdown file with executive summary, computation walk-through, cross-check results, positions taken, attention flags, attestation block.

3. **`taxpayer_action_list.md`** — Markdown file with all Section 11 contents.

All three files are placed in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` and presented to the user at the end.

If execution runs out of context mid-build, complete the computation work first and produce whichever formatted outputs are finished, then state clearly which deliverables are partial.

---

## Section 15 — Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated; the reviewer or taxpayer enters values into the ZATCA portal using the working paper.
2. ZATCA XML / API submission is not produced by this skill; integrations with ERP / e-invoicing solution providers handle that.
3. Auditor's report attachment is the taxpayer's responsibility; this skill flags audit requirement based on revenue threshold but does not produce the audit itself.
4. Transfer pricing Local File / Master File / CbCR content is referenced via sa-corporate-tax but not assembled here.
5. Treaty-based WHT reductions are referenced via sa-withholding-tax but specific DTA analysis is upstream.
6. Special regimes (Aramco upstream petroleum, natural gas investment, banking, insurance, SEZ, RHQ, NEOM, Red Sea Global, Qiddiya) are out of scope.
7. Sharia-board specific interpretations of Zakat base are out of scope; the capstone applies ZATCA Implementing Regulations as published.
8. Hijri-year conversions are handled by sa-zakat; the capstone uses the upstream output as-is.
9. Local labor compliance beyond WPS / Nitaqat (e.g., specific MHRSD inspections) is out of scope.
10. Customs duty interactions on imports / exports are out of scope; ZATCA merged with Saudi Customs in 2021 but the Customs Schedule is administered separately.

### Change log
- **v1.0 (May 2026):** Initial release. Modelled on pk-return-assembly and us-ca-return-assembly, adapted for Saudi annual returns, ZATCA portal filing, SADAD billing payment flow, the Zakat / CIT / mixed-entity split, WPS + Saudization compliance integration, and Royal Decree-based statutory references. Coordinates nine upstream Saudi skills.
