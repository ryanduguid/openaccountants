## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required intake before recommending an entity

1. Nationality of each founder / shareholder (Saudi, GCC national, or non-GCC foreign) and whether each is an individual or a legal person.
2. Number of founders and intended directorships / managers.
3. Intended business activity using the **MISA / MoC ISIC-based activity code list** — the activity drives whether the negative list, sectoral cap, or RHQ qualifying-activity list applies.
4. Expected paid-up capital and source of funds (SAR or USD equivalent).
5. Whether any non-GCC foreign shareholder is involved (triggers MISA licensing).
6. Whether the activity is on the **MISA Negative List** (a small set of sectors closed to foreign investment — see R-SA-F2).
7. Whether the activity is regulated by SAMA, CMA, CITC, MEEM, MoH, NCAAA, GACA, or another sector regulator.
8. Whether the business will hire employees (triggers GOSI registration, Mudad enrolment, and Saudization / Nitaqat obligations).
9. Whether the parent group qualifies for the **RHQ Program** (multinational with regional operations across MENA wanting Saudi to host the regional HQ).
10. Whether the business expects VAT-registrable turnover (> SAR 375,000) and whether it will engage in zero-rated exports or reverse-charge imports.
11. Province / city of principal place of business (Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Mecca, Medina — some sectors have geographic restrictions, e.g. Hajj/Umrah service providers must be in Mecca / Medina).
12. Whether the founders are present in Saudi or will use a Saudi resident representative for filings.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-SA-F1 — Nominee / sham Saudi partner arrangements.** "Using a Saudi national as a nominee 'sponsor' or fronting partner to disguise 100% foreign ownership where the activity does not actually require Saudi participation contravenes the **Anti-Concealment Law (Nizam Mukafahat al-Tasattur)** issued by Royal Decree No. M/4 of 1442H, which carries fines up to SAR 5 million and imprisonment up to 5 years. The skill will not draft or advise on nominee / *tasattur* arrangements. Where genuine Saudi participation is commercially desired, document substance with a properly drafted shareholders' agreement, real capital contribution, and operational role. Escalate complex cases to a Saudi-qualified legal practitioner."

**R-SA-F2 — Sectors on the MISA Negative List.** "Certain activities are reserved for Saudi nationals or otherwise closed / restricted to foreign investment under the MISA Negative List and the Implementing Regulations of the New Investment Law (2025). The current restricted list is narrow but includes: (i) military equipment, uniforms, and devices for civilian use of military-grade tools; (ii) civilian explosives; (iii) certain real-estate brokerage in Mecca and Medina; (iv) Hajj and Umrah service provision to pilgrims (some sub-activities only); (v) recruitment / labour-supply offices in specified sub-categories; (vi) some printing and publishing of religious material; (vii) fishing in territorial waters. The list is reviewed periodically by the Council of Ministers — always verify against the **current MISA published list** at the date of advice. The skill flags negative-list issues but does not handle exemption applications."

**R-SA-F3 — Iqama, work visa, Saudization quota strategy.** "Iqama (residency permit), block visa allocations, Premium Residency (Saudi 'green card'), and Nitaqat Saudization tier strategy are handled by MHRSD, the Saudi Passport Directorate (Jawazat), and the Premium Residency Centre. The skill flags requirements but does not handle immigration filings or tier-band optimisation; for deep Saudization analysis see the sa-gosi-saudization skill, and for immigration engage a Saudi labour-law specialist."

**R-SA-F4 — Bank account opening for foreign-owned entities.** "Saudi banks require the appointed General Manager / managing director (often required to be Saudi-resident with a valid iqama for some banks) to attend in person for KYC under **SAMA AML/CFT Rules** and **CDD requirements**. Some banks impose minimum balance requirements and operational presence checks. The skill flags the requirement but does not guarantee any specific bank's onboarding timeline or outcome."

**R-SA-F5 — Regulated sectors: banking, insurance, payment services, capital markets, telecom, healthcare, education, pharma.** "These require sector licences (**SAMA** for banks, insurers, finance companies, payment service providers, EMIs, exchange houses; **CMA** for brokers, asset managers, custodians, investment funds, Tadawul-listed entities; **CITC** for telecom operators, ISPs, and licensed value-added services; **MoH** for hospitals, clinics, labs, pharmacies; **NCAAA / Ministry of Education** for higher education and licensed schools; **SFDA** for pharmaceuticals and medical devices; **GACA** for aviation) **in addition to** MISA + MoC formation. Capital floors and substance requirements are materially higher than the Companies Law minimums. Formation alone is insufficient — the skill refuses to provide a green-light recommendation without mapping the sectoral licence."

**R-SA-F6 — RHQ Program eligibility claims without substance.** "Claiming the **RHQ Program 30-year 0% CIT / 0% WHT** incentive without satisfying the substance, qualifying-activity, and economic-presence requirements (minimum number of qualifying employees, board meetings held in Saudi Arabia, regional strategic direction provided from the Saudi RHQ, etc.) is refused. The incentive is subject to ZATCA and MISA verification; failure triggers retroactive tax assessment plus penalties. The skill flags the program at a high level but defers detailed RHQ qualification to a Saudi tax specialist."

**R-SA-F7 — Zakat vs CIT splitting via artificial restructuring.** "Recommending the insertion of a nominal Saudi or GCC shareholder solely to shift profits from the 20% CIT regime to the 2.5% Zakat regime, without genuine economic ownership and substance, is refused under the ZATCA general anti-avoidance principles and the substance-over-form doctrine applied in **Zakat Implementing Regulations 2017 (as amended)**. Real Saudi/GCC participation with capital at risk is required for Zakat treatment on the corresponding share."

**R-SA-F8 — Mecca / Medina restrictions for foreign-owned entities.** "Certain activities in **Mecca and Medina**, including real-estate ownership and brokerage, residential leasing to pilgrims, and Hajj/Umrah operations, are restricted to Saudi nationals or Saudi-owned entities. Foreign-owned entities cannot directly own real property in the two holy cities; investment vehicles (Saudi REITs, listed shares) may participate indirectly. The skill flags the restriction and refuses to recommend structures that contravene it."

**R-SA-F9 — Boycott and sanctions screening.** "Saudi Arabia maintains its own commercial sanctions / boycott register under the **General Authority for Foreign Trade**. Counterparties on the Saudi commercial register are screened during MISA / MoC processing. The skill flags the screening but does not perform sanctions / boycott checks; counterparties of concern must be cleared through proper compliance channels before MISA submission."

## Section 3 — Entity Types in Detail

### 3.1 Sole Establishment (Mu'assasah Fardiyyah)

#### Nature
A **Sole Establishment** (مؤسسة فردية, *Mu'assasah Fardiyyah*) is a business owned and operated by a **single Saudi or GCC national** in their personal capacity. It is not a separate legal person under the Companies Law — the proprietor is the business, with unlimited personal liability. It is registered solely with the **Ministry of Commerce** through a Commercial Registration (Sijil Tijari); MISA is not involved because foreign ownership is not permitted.

#### Key features
- **Owner**: 1 individual (Saudi national or GCC national only); legal persons cannot own a Sole Establishment.
- **Liability**: unlimited personal liability of the proprietor.
- **Capital**: no statutory minimum.
- **Legal personality**: none — the proprietor contracts in their own name (with the trade name as an alias).
- **Name**: must include the proprietor's personal name or an approved trade name; cannot use "L.L.C.", "J.S.C.", or other corporate suffixes.
- **Foreign ownership**: not permitted. A foreign individual must use an LLC (single-member LLC since 2022) via MISA.

#### Formation steps
1. **Choose business activity** using the MoC ISIC-based code list.
2. **Reserve trade name** on the MoC portal (mc.gov.sa).
3. **Submit Commercial Registration application** through MoC portal with national ID (Hawiya), proof of address, and activity code(s). Pay the CR fee (sliding scale by activity and capital).
4. Receive **Commercial Registration certificate (Sijil Tijari)** — typically 1–3 working days.
5. **Register with the Chamber of Commerce** in the city of registration — annual subscription required.
6. **Register with ZATCA** for Zakat (and VAT if turnover threshold met).
7. **Register with GOSI** if hiring employees.
8. **Register on Qiwa and Mudad** for workforce management and wage protection if hiring.
9. **Sector licences** where applicable.

#### Tax
- **Zakat at 2.5%** of the Zakat base (computed on equity-based formula under Zakat Implementing Regulations 2017).
- **No CIT** for Saudi/GCC-owned Sole Establishments — Zakat is the only direct tax on profits.
- **VAT at 15%** if turnover exceeds SAR 375,000 (mandatory) or SAR 187,500 (voluntary).
- **WHT obligations** on payments to non-resident service providers (royalties 15%, management fees 20%, technical / consulting fees 5%, etc.).
- Annual Zakat return filing with ZATCA; periodic VAT returns (monthly if turnover > SAR 40M, otherwise quarterly).

#### When to use
- Saudi or GCC national operating a small retail shop, professional services practice, or trade business where corporate substance is not required.
- Family business with a single owner where unlimited liability is acceptable.

#### When to avoid
- Any foreign-ownership component — must use LLC via MISA.
- Liability-sensitive activities (contracting, manufacturing with consumer exposure).
- Multi-owner ventures — must use LLC or JSC.
- Where the activity requires a sector licence that mandates a corporate vehicle (banking, insurance, capital markets — all require JSC).

### 3.2 Limited Liability Company (LLC) — Sharikah dhāt mas'uliyyah mahdūdah

#### Nature
The **LLC** (شركة ذات مسؤولية محدودة, *Sharikah dhāt mas'uliyyah mahdūdah*) is a separate legal person with limited liability, governed by the **Companies Law (Royal Decree No. M/3 of 1437H as amended by Royal Decree No. M/132 of 1443H, 2022)**. It is by far the **most common vehicle for foreign investors** entering Saudi Arabia and the default recommendation for non-listed operating businesses.

#### Key features
- **Members**: minimum 1 (single-member LLC permitted since 2022); maximum 50.
- **Foreign ownership**: 100% permitted in most sectors. MISA license required for any foreign shareholder.
- **Liability**: limited to each member's capital contribution.
- **Capital**: **no statutory minimum** under the 2022 Companies Law for ordinary LLCs (the historic SAR 500,000 floor was removed). Sectoral floors override (e.g. SAMA fintech, CMA-licensed activities, insurance). Foreign-owned LLCs are often required by MISA to subscribe higher capital in practice depending on activity — commonly SAR 500,000 for commercial activities, SAR 100,000+ for services, SAR 25,000,000+ for trading / wholesale, and SAR 30,000,000+ for real-estate development. **Always verify against the current MISA capital schedule for the specific activity code.**
- **Management**: one or more managers ("General Manager" / "Managing Director") appointed in the articles or by member resolution. No mandatory board for LLCs.
- **Governance**: members meet at least annually; resolutions in writing acceptable. Statutory books: register of members, register of charges, minute book.
- **Audit**: mandatory for LLCs above the audit thresholds in the Companies Law Implementing Regulations (broadly: capital ≥ SAR 5M, employees ≥ 50, or revenue ≥ SAR 20M — verify against current thresholds). Foreign-owned LLCs are commonly audited regardless of size.
- **Beneficial Ownership**: UBO disclosure mandatory under MoC Beneficial Ownership Regulations 2024.

#### Formation steps (foreign-owned LLC — most common case)
1. **MISA Investment License application** (Section 4) — submit business plan, parent financials, activity code, capital, and shareholder details on the MISA portal. **2–6 weeks**.
2. **Trade name reservation** with MoC.
3. **Draft Articles of Association** (AoA) — bilingual Arabic/English. Notarisation at the notary public (kātib al-'adl) or e-notarisation via MoC portal.
4. **Submit Commercial Registration application** on MoC portal with MISA license, AoA, and shareholder ID/passport. **1–2 weeks**.
5. **Commercial Registration certificate (CR) issued**. The CR is the operating licence — the company can now contract.
6. **Chamber of Commerce membership** (mandatory; annual fee).
7. **ZATCA registration** — for Zakat (Saudi/GCC share), CIT (foreign share), and VAT.
8. **GOSI registration** as an employer.
9. **Qiwa, Mudad, Absher business** enrolment for workforce and government services.
10. **Open bank account** at a local Saudi bank with CR, AoA, MISA license, manager's iqama (if foreign), and board / member resolutions on signatory authority.
11. **Sector licences** as applicable (SAMA, CMA, CITC, etc.).
12. **Office lease** registered on Ejar (mandatory) — operating address must be a genuine commercial premises.
13. **Mudad payroll setup** before first payroll cycle (Wage Protection System).

#### Tax
- **Mixed-ownership taxation**: profits attributable to **non-Saudi / non-GCC shareholders are subject to CIT at 20%**; profits attributable to **Saudi / GCC shareholders are subject to Zakat at 2.5%** of the Zakat base. Computed pro-rata by share ownership.
- **100% foreign-owned LLC**: 20% CIT on all profits.
- **100% Saudi/GCC-owned LLC**: 2.5% Zakat on the Zakat base.

- **Annual return** with ZATCA within 120 days of FY end (CIT) or 120 days for Zakat. Audited financials submitted alongside.

- **Real Estate Transaction Tax (RETT)** 5% on real-estate transfers (separate from VAT since October 2020).

#### When to use
- **Foreign company opening a Saudi subsidiary** for ongoing operations — the canonical default.
- **Saudi / GCC entrepreneurs** wanting limited liability without the complexity of a JSC.
- **Joint ventures** between Saudi and foreign partners (mixed-ownership LLC with shareholders' agreement on top of AoA).
- Activities not requiring a JSC (everything except banking, insurance, public-offer capital markets, and listed entities).

#### When to avoid

- Activities requiring JSC by sectoral regulation (banking, insurance, finance companies, asset managers in some categories).
- Where the founder count exceeds 50 — convert to JSC.

### 3.3 Joint Stock Company — Closed JSC (Sharikah musahamah mughlaqah)

#### Nature
The **Closed JSC** (شركة مساهمة مغلقة, *Sharikah musahamah mughlaqah*) is a joint stock company whose shares are **not offered to the public** and not listed on Tadawul, but which has the corporate substance and governance of a JSC. Governed by the Companies Law 2022 amendments.

#### Formation steps
1. **MISA license** (if foreign shareholders).
2. **Founders' agreement** drafted.
3. **AoA and statutes** drafted; notarised.
4. **Subscription** for founders' shares; full payment of capital into a Saudi blocked bank account (subscription account).
5. **Constitutive General Assembly** convened to confirm subscription, appoint board and auditor.
6. **Submit incorporation file to MoC**; CR issued.
7. **Standard post-incorporation steps**: Chamber of Commerce, ZATCA, GOSI, Mudad, sector licences.

#### Tax
- Same as LLC — mixed-ownership pro-rata 20% CIT / 2.5% Zakat split.
- VAT 15%, WHT regimes as above.

#### When to use
- **JV between 2+ unrelated investors** wanting JSC governance, board oversight, and a transferable share structure short of public listing.
- **Pre-IPO holding vehicle** in preparation for Tadawul listing.
- **Family conglomerates** wanting institutional governance.

#### When to avoid
- Single founder / member — use LLC (cheaper, simpler).
- Pure operating subsidiary with one parent — use LLC.

### 3.4 Open Joint Stock Company / Listed JSC

#### Nature
The **Open JSC** is the public-company form whose shares may be offered to the public and listed on **Tadawul (Saudi Exchange)** or **Nomu (parallel market for SMEs)**. Subject to **CMA (Capital Market Authority)** regulation in addition to Companies Law.

#### Key features
- **Min capital**: **SAR 10 million** for Tadawul main market; **SAR 10 million** for Nomu (lower free-float and disclosure thresholds).
- **Free float**: ≥ 30% on Tadawul main market; ≥ 20% on Nomu.

2. Prospectus prepared and filed with CMA under the Rules on the Offer of Securities and Continuing Obligations.
3. CMA approval of the prospectus.
4. Public offer underwriting; subscription period; allotment.
5. Tadawul / Nomu listing approval; trading commences.

#### Tax

- Listed company surcharges and disclosures under CMA framework.

#### When to use
- Mature company ready for IPO with audited 3-year financials.

#### When to avoid
- Pre-revenue, pre-profit, or pre-governance-maturity companies.

### 3.5 Branch of Foreign Company

#### Nature
A **Branch of a Foreign Company** is an **extension of the foreign parent** authorised to conduct business in Saudi Arabia. It is **not a separate legal person** — contracts bind the parent, and the parent is liable for branch obligations. Governed by the Companies Law and the New Investment Law's branch provisions.

#### Key features
- **Owner**: 1 foreign parent company.
- **Liability**: foreign parent liable.
- **Capital**: set by MISA; commonly SAR 500,000 for commercial branches and lower for services. Some sectors require higher capital.
- **Activity**: branch can only conduct the activities specifically authorised in its MISA license and CR — narrower than the parent's worldwide activities.
- **Governance**: branch is run by a Branch Manager appointed by the parent's board; no separate board.
- **Repatriation**: branch profits, after CIT, may be repatriated to the parent (subject to 5% WHT on the deemed dividend on repatriation in some interpretations — verify with ZATCA).

#### Formation steps
1. **MISA license** application (Branch route).
2. **Trade name reservation** at MoC (must include "Branch of [Parent Name]" or equivalent Arabic).
3. **Parent corporate documents** notarised, attested (Apostille where applicable; legalised by Saudi embassy in the parent's country if not Apostille).
4. **Branch CR** issued by MoC.
5. **Chamber of Commerce**, ZATCA, GOSI, Mudad, sector licences as for an LLC.

#### Tax
- **CIT 20%** on branch profits (no Zakat — no Saudi shareholder).
- **WHT 5% on deemed dividend** on profit repatriation under some ZATCA interpretations.
- VAT 15% as for any registered entity.
- Same WHT obligations on outbound payments.

#### When to use
- Foreign company executing specific projects in Saudi (engineering, construction, consulting) without committing to a separate Saudi subsidiary.
- Service businesses where the parent's brand and reputation are central and corporate separation is not commercially required.
- Initial market entry with intent to convert to an LLC subsidiary later if scale grows.

#### When to avoid
- Activities exposing the parent group to significant Saudi-law liability (corporate veil benefits matter).
- Long-term operations where Saudization, social benefits, and integration favour a Saudi subsidiary.
- Where regulatory rules require a Saudi legal person (banking, insurance, listed-market activities — must be JSC).

## Section 4 — Foreign Investment Process: MISA (Ministry of Investment)

The **Ministry of Investment of Saudi Arabia (MISA)** — formerly SAGIA (Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority) until February 2020 — is the single authority responsible for licensing foreign investment in Saudi Arabia. **A MISA license is mandatory before any non-GCC foreign shareholder can hold equity in a Saudi entity**, and **before** the entity can apply for Commercial Registration at the MoC.

### Legal basis
- **New Investment Law** promulgated by **Royal Decree No. M/19 of 4/2/1446H (August 2024)**, with **Implementing Regulations effective 2025**.
- The New Investment Law modernised the prior **Foreign Investment Law of 2000** and equalised treatment between domestic and foreign investors in most respects, while preserving the **negative list** of restricted activities and the licensing requirement for foreign equity.

### MISA license categories

| Category | Typical use case |
|---|---|
| **Service license** | Consulting, IT services, professional services, training, software, marketing |
| **Trading / Commercial license** | Wholesale, retail, distribution, import/export of goods |
| **Industrial license** | Manufacturing, assembly, processing |
| **Construction / Contracting license** | EPC, building, infrastructure, MEP |
| **Real-estate license** | Real-estate development (subject to Mecca/Medina restriction — R-SA-F8) |
| **Agriculture license** | Crop, livestock, aquaculture |
| **Mining license** | Mineral exploration / extraction (with Ministry of Industry & Mineral Resources coordination) |
| **Transport / Logistics license** | Freight, courier, logistics services |
| **Tourism license** | Hotels, tour operators, travel agencies |
| **Education license** | Private schools, training institutes (with MoE / TVTC coordination) |
| **Health license** | Hospitals, clinics, labs (with MoH coordination) |
| **Audiovisual / Media license** | Production, broadcasting (with GCAM / GAMR coordination) |
| **Entrepreneur license (Riyadi)** | Founders backed by approved Saudi accelerators / incubators |
| **Premium Residency-linked license** | Holders of Saudi Premium Residency operating businesses |
| **Regional Headquarters (RHQ) license** | Multinational regional HQ qualifying for 30-year tax incentive (Section 6) |

### MISA application process

1. **Activity code selection**: choose the precise ISIC-based activity code from the MISA list. The code drives capital requirements, sectoral coordination, and negative-list checks.
2. **Account creation** on the MISA portal (misa.gov.sa).
3. **Submit application** online with:
   - Parent company documents (certificate of incorporation, AoA, latest financial statements, board resolution authorising Saudi expansion) — notarised, Apostilled or legalised by Saudi embassy.
   - Shareholder details (legal persons or individuals); passport copies for individuals.
   - Business plan covering Saudi operations, projected employment, capital deployment, and Saudization commitment.
   - Proposed activity code and trade name.
4. **MISA review**: 2–6 weeks typical for standard activities. Sensitive sectors (regulated, sectoral coordination required) take longer.
5. **Capital subscription confirmation**: for some activities MISA requires evidence that the proposed paid-up capital is available (bank reference letter or commitment).
6. **MISA license issued**: digital certificate downloadable from the portal. License is **renewable annually**.
7. **Post-MISA**: proceed to MoC for Commercial Registration (Section 5).

### Negative list and restricted sectors
The negative list under the New Investment Law Implementing Regulations 2025 is narrow but includes (see R-SA-F2): military equipment, civilian explosives, certain real-estate brokerage in Mecca and Medina, certain Hajj/Umrah service categories, certain recruitment-office sub-categories, religious publishing of certain materials, and territorial-waters fishing. **Always check the current MISA published list at the date of advice — the list has been progressively shortened as part of Vision 2030 opening reforms.**

### Sectoral caps
Some sectors permit foreign equity only up to a cap (commonly 49% or 75%); the remainder must be held by a Saudi shareholder. Examples (verify current rules):
- **Insurance**: foreign equity cap historically 49%, raised in stages (verify SAMA rules).
- **Land transport of passengers (some categories)**: cap applies.
- **Recruitment offices**: cap or full restriction depending on sub-activity.
- **Audiovisual broadcasting**: cap applies.

### MISA license renewal
Annual renewal on the MISA portal. Renewal requires:
- Up-to-date CR.
- Updated financial statements.
- Compliance with Saudization (Nitaqat) at least at the **Medium Green** tier (or the tier required for the activity).
- Payment of renewal fee.
- No outstanding ZATCA, GOSI, MHRSD, or municipality penalties.

## Section 5 — Commercial Registration (CR) from MoC

The **Commercial Registration (Sijil Tijari)** issued by the **Ministry of Commerce (MoC)** is the operating licence of the entity. **No business may operate in Saudi Arabia without a valid CR** (with limited exceptions for representative offices).

### Process
1. **Trade name reservation** on the MoC portal (mc.gov.sa). The name must be in Arabic (English transliteration permitted). It cannot contain restricted words ("Bank", "Insurance", "Government", "Royal" — restricted; some require regulator NOC).
2. **AoA notarisation**:
   - **LLC and JSC**: AoA must be notarised, traditionally at the notary public (*kātib al-'adl*) or e-notarised via the MoC portal.
   - **Sole Establishment**: no AoA required.
3. **CR application** submitted on MoC portal with:
   - MISA license (for foreign-owned entities).
   - Notarised AoA (for LLC / JSC).
   - National ID / iqama / passport copies of shareholders and managers.
   - Proof of registered office (Ejar lease registration).
   - Proposed activity codes (one main + multiple secondary).
4. **CR issued** within 1–2 weeks (often faster for straightforward cases). The CR contains the entity name, type, activity codes, capital, shareholders, manager, and registered address.
5. **Annual CR renewal** required; failure to renew triggers fines and ultimately CR cancellation.
6. **Beneficial Ownership filing**: UBO disclosure mandatory on the MoC portal under the BO Regulations 2024. Updates required within 60 days of any change.

### Chamber of Commerce membership
- Mandatory after CR issuance.
- Subscription based on capital and city.
- Provides certificate-of-origin issuance, dispute mediation, and chamber-network access.

### Ejar registered lease
- All commercial leases must be registered on the **Ejar platform** (administered by the Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing).
- Required for CR issuance for most activities.
- Drives municipal license issuance and Saudization compliance tracking.

### Municipality license (Baladiyah)
- Required for any premises open to the public (retail, restaurants, clinics, offices receiving clients).
- Issued by the relevant municipality based on Ejar lease and CR.
- Annual renewal.

1. Register products on **SABER** (saber.sa).
2. Obtain a **Product Certificate of Conformity (PCoC)** for each model from an SASO-approved Conformity Assessment Body.
3. Obtain a **Shipment Certificate of Conformity (SCoC)** for each import shipment.

Categories covered include electrical / electronic devices, toys, low-voltage equipment, machinery, construction materials, chemicals, and food-contact materials. Failure to comply blocks customs clearance.

### 6.2 Regional Headquarters (RHQ) Program

Launched in 2021 and operationalised in 2024, the **RHQ Program** offers significant tax incentives to multinationals establishing their **regional headquarters covering MENA** in Saudi Arabia.

**Key incentives:**
- **0% Corporate Income Tax for 30 years** on qualifying RHQ income.
- **0% Withholding Tax for 30 years** on dividends, royalties, and service fees paid by the RHQ to non-resident affiliates in respect of qualifying activities.
- **Saudization exemption period** in early years; preferred access to government contracts (since 1 January 2024, government entities are required to source from RHQ-licensed entities for regional services).

**Eligibility (high level):**
- Multinational group with operations in multiple MENA countries.
- The Saudi RHQ must perform **strategic and management functions** for the region (regional strategic direction, business planning, regional financial coordination, sales planning, etc.).
- **Substance requirements**: minimum number of qualifying employees in Riyadh (typically 15+ including senior executives), board meetings held in Saudi Arabia, regional CEO and CFO resident in Saudi Arabia.
- **Qualifying-activity test**: 100% of the RHQ entity's activities must be qualifying RHQ services (strategic management, regional financial management, regional marketing, business development, etc.). Income from non-qualifying activities loses the incentive on the non-qualifying portion.

**License process:** application via the MISA RHQ portal in coordination with the Royal Commission for Riyadh City; specialised review including substance assessment. Approval timeline 4–12 weeks.

**Refusal flag (R-SA-F6):** Do not assume RHQ qualification without verified substance and qualifying activities.

## Section 8 — GOSI Registration + Mudad Payroll Setup

### GOSI (General Organization for Social Insurance)

Mandatory for every Saudi employer. Covers occupational hazards (work-injury) for all employees regardless of nationality, and old-age / disability / death benefits for Saudi and GCC employees.

#### Contribution rates (2025)

| Component | Employer | Employee | Applies to |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Old-age, disability, death (OADI)** | **9%** | **9%** | Saudi / GCC employees |
| **Unemployment insurance (SANED)** | **1.5%** | **1.5%** | Saudi employees only |
| **Occupational hazards (work-injury)** | **2%** | 0% | All employees regardless of nationality |
| **Total — Saudi employee** | **12.5%** | **10.5%** | |
| **Total — GCC employee** | **11%** | **9%** | |
| **Total — Non-Saudi / non-GCC employee** | **2%** | 0% | |

Contribution base: gross wage (basic + housing allowance) capped at SAR 45,000/month (verify against current ceiling).

#### Registration steps
1. **GOSI employer account** created on gosi.gov.sa using CR number and authorised signatory.
2. **Establishment register** confirmed with workforce.
3. **Enrol each employee** with national ID / iqama, contract terms, and wage.
4. **Monthly contribution submission** and payment by the 15th of the following month.

### Mudad (Wage Protection System)

**Mudad** is the platform integrating GOSI, MHRSD, and the Saudi banking system for wage protection. Mandatory for all private-sector employers since 2013 (phased rollout completed).

- Employer must pay salaries through a Saudi bank account; salaries flow through Mudad which verifies they match GOSI-registered wages.
- Failure to pay on time triggers Mudad flags, escalating to MHRSD penalties and Saudization tier downgrades.
- Mudad also handles contract management (electronic employment contracts), end-of-service benefit calculations, and leave tracking integration.

### Qiwa

**Qiwa** is the MHRSD workforce-management platform covering Saudization (Nitaqat) tier tracking, work permit administration, contract authentication, and labour-mobility services. Mandatory enrolment for all employers.

### Saudization (Nitaqat) — high-level

- Every employer is classified into a Nitaqat tier based on the percentage of Saudi nationals in the workforce relative to the sector benchmark: **Platinum**, **High Green**, **Medium Green**, **Low Green**, **Red**.
- Higher tiers grant privileges (faster work-visa issuance, expatriate transfers, government-contract access).
- Lower tiers (Red) trigger restrictions and ultimately suspension of work-visa services.
- New companies typically receive a **grace period** (first 6–12 months) before Nitaqat begins to bite.
- For deeper Saudization tier mapping and sector benchmarks, see the **sa-gosi-saudization** skill.

## Section 9 — Decision Tree

```
Q1: Is any non-GCC foreign individual or entity proposed as a shareholder?
  YES → go to Q1a (MISA license route)
  NO  → go to Q2 (Saudi/GCC route)

Q1a: Is the proposed activity on the MISA Negative List
     (military equipment, civilian explosives, Mecca/Medina real-estate brokerage,
     specified Hajj/Umrah categories, restricted recruitment categories,
     restricted religious publishing, territorial-waters fishing)?
  YES → Refuse green-light recommendation (R-SA-F2); escalate to MISA / Saudi legal counsel
  NO  → go to Q1b

Q1b: Does the activity have a sectoral foreign-ownership cap (insurance, certain transport, certain
     media, etc.)?
  YES → Mixed-ownership LLC / JSC with Saudi partner at the required share;
        draft shareholders' agreement; flag tasattur risk (R-SA-F1)
  NO  → 100% foreign ownership permitted; proceed to Q1c

Q1c: Is the entity a regional HQ for a multinational covering MENA, with substance to
     locate 15+ qualifying employees and regional management in Riyadh?
  YES → Recommend MISA RHQ license — 0% CIT / 0% WHT for 30 years (Section 6.1);
        flag substance and qualifying-activity tests (R-SA-F6); confirm with Saudi tax specialist
  NO  → go to Q1d

Q1d: Does the foreign parent want a separate Saudi legal person with limited liability?
  YES → 100% foreign-owned LLC via MISA — canonical default for foreign investors
  NO  → Branch of Foreign Company via MISA — parent remains liable, narrower activity scope

Q2: Is the proposed activity regulated (banking, insurance, capital markets, telecom,
    healthcare, pharma, education, aviation, mining, power)?
  YES → Refuse green-light recommendation; map sector licence (R-SA-F5);
        entity type often dictated by regulator (banking and insurance require JSC)
  NO  → go to Q3

Q3: Is the founder a single Saudi or GCC national wanting simplicity and accepting
    unlimited liability?
  YES → Sole Establishment (Mu'assasah Fardiyyah) — registered solely at MoC
  NO  → go to Q4

Q4: Does the venture have 2+ unrelated Saudi/GCC investors wanting JSC governance
    or planning IPO on Tadawul / Nomu within 3 years?
  YES → Closed JSC (min capital SAR 500,000) with view to Open JSC at IPO
  NO  → go to Q5

Q5: Single founder or up to 50 members wanting limited liability and corporate substance?
  YES → LLC (single-member LLC permitted since 2022) — most common Saudi/GCC vehicle
  NO  → Reconsider — escalate for bespoke advice

After entity selection, in every case:
  → ZATCA registration (Zakat / CIT / VAT / WHT)
  → GOSI + Mudad + Qiwa setup before first hire
  → Sector licences as applicable
  → Confirm RHQ Program eligibility if multinational with regional substance
  → Confirm MEEM / SABER product conformity if importing covered goods
```

## Section 10 — Worked Example: US Software Company Opening a Saudi Office

**Fact pattern.** Acme Cloud Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in San Francisco, is a SaaS company selling cloud-based collaboration software. It has strong demand from Saudi government and enterprise customers (driven by Vision 2030 digitisation programmes) and wants to establish a Saudi office to:
- Hire 12 Saudi-resident sales, solutions-engineering, and customer-success staff in Riyadh.
- Issue invoices to Saudi customers in SAR (currently invoices come from a Dubai-based reseller).
- Provide localised data hosting via a Saudi cloud region (compliance with CITC's Cloud Computing Regulatory Framework and the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law).

Acme Cloud is **not** establishing a regional HQ for all of MENA — Dubai will remain the regional HQ; the Saudi office is purely a Saudi-market entity. Therefore the **RHQ Program is not in scope** (R-SA-F6 — substance test would not be met).

### Recommended structure

**100% foreign-owned LLC via MISA Service license**.

**Why not a branch?** Branch of a foreign company exposes Acme Cloud Inc. directly to Saudi-law liability and limits activity to the narrowly authorised scope. A separate LLC corporate veil is preferred for a sustained Saudi presence with 12+ employees and customer contracts.

**Why not Closed JSC?** No multiple founders and no IPO plan — JSC governance burden is disproportionate.

**Why not RHQ?** Acme Cloud's regional management remains in Dubai. The substance test for RHQ (15+ qualifying employees in Riyadh, regional CEO/CFO resident in Saudi, board meetings in Saudi) is not met. Attempting to claim RHQ benefits without substance would trigger ZATCA retroactive assessment (R-SA-F6).

### Capital structure
- **Paid-up capital**: SAR 500,000 (typical MISA expectation for services license — verify against the current MISA capital schedule for the precise activity code).
- **Shareholder**: 100% Acme Cloud Inc. (single-member LLC permitted since 2022 Companies Law).
- **Manager**: General Manager appointed (initially seconded from US parent on a work visa; later replaced by a locally hired Saudi GM to support Nitaqat scoring).

### Formation steps and timeline

| Week | Step |
|---|---|
| 1 | Activity code selection (ISIC code for "Computer programming activities" / "Computer consultancy" / "Other information technology and computer service activities"); MISA portal account opened |
| 1 | Parent documents (Delaware Certificate of Incorporation, bylaws, board resolution authorising Saudi expansion, parent audited financials) notarised, Apostilled in California, legalised by Saudi consulate where needed |
| 2 | MISA license application submitted |
| 2–6 | MISA review; queries on business plan, projected employment, and Saudization commitment answered |
| 6 | MISA Service license issued |
| 6 | Trade name reservation at MoC |
| 7 | AoA drafted (Arabic/English bilingual); e-notarised via MoC portal |
| 7–8 | Commercial Registration application; CR issued |
| 8 | Chamber of Commerce membership |
| 8 | ZATCA TIN auto-issued; CIT and VAT registration confirmed; voluntary VAT registration if revenue < SAR 375,000 in first year (recommended to claim input VAT on local expenses) |
| 8–9 | GOSI employer account; Mudad enrolment; Qiwa enrolment |
| 9 | Office lease registered on Ejar; municipality licence applied for |
| 9–10 | Bank account opening with a tier-1 Saudi bank (Al Rajhi / SNB / Riyad Bank / SABB); GM iqama may be required by some banks |
| 10 | Sector compliance: CITC Cloud Computing Regulatory Framework registration as a cloud service customer / provider; PDPL compliance review |
| 10–12 | First hires through Qiwa; Mudad payroll go-live; iqama transfers / new iqama applications via Jawazat |

### Tax position

- **CIT**: 20% on Saudi LLC taxable income.
- **VAT**: 15% on Saudi customer invoices. Voluntary VAT registration from day 1 to allow input VAT recovery on local expenses (office rent, utilities, professional fees, equipment).
- **WHT on payments to US parent**: 5% on technical / consulting fees and royalties on intercompany IP licence (with treaty consideration — Saudi Arabia and the US do not currently have a bilateral DTT in force; verify, as treaties are evolving), 5% on dividends. Royalties WHT 15% (subject to treaty if applicable).
- **GOSI**: 12.5% employer / 10.5% employee on Saudi employees; 2% employer on non-Saudi employees (occupational hazards only).
- **Saudization**: Sector benchmark applies; first 6–12 months grace; thereafter Nitaqat tier tracking. Aim for Medium Green or higher to preserve work-visa privileges.
- **Transfer pricing**: ZATCA Transfer Pricing Bylaws apply to intercompany SaaS licensing, cost-plus services, and management fees. Local File / Master File obligations if Saudi LLC revenue ≥ SAR 200M; CbCR if global group revenue ≥ SAR 3.2B (which Acme Cloud's group may meet). Arm's-length pricing on the intercompany SaaS reseller arrangement is essential.

### Risks and mitigations

- **Substance and PE risk for US parent**: ensure clear contractual delineation that the Saudi LLC operates on its own account (not as a dependent agent of the US parent). Saudi-customer contracts should be signed by the Saudi LLC (not Acme Cloud Inc.) to avoid creating a permanent establishment of Acme Cloud Inc. itself.
- **Data localisation**: the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) and CITC cloud rules require certain customer data (especially government and regulated-sector) to be hosted in-Kingdom. Use a Saudi cloud region.
- **PDPL compliance**: appoint a Data Protection Officer; map data flows; ensure international transfers comply with PDPL controller obligations.
- **CITC registration**: cloud services with Saudi customers may require CITC registration depending on the Cloud Service Provider / Customer classification.
- **Saudization**: hire Saudi nationals from day 1 (sales, solutions engineering, customer success) to meet Nitaqat tier; partner with a Saudization placement firm if needed.

## Section 11 — Conservative Defaults

When operating under uncertainty:

1. **Default to LLC for foreign investors.** The LLC is the canonical Saudi vehicle for foreign-owned operating businesses. Single-member LLC has been available since 2022 and obviates the need for a token second shareholder.
2. **Always check the MISA Negative List at the date of advice.** The list has been progressively shortened under Vision 2030 — never rely on cached knowledge.
3. **Always verify capital requirements against the current MISA capital schedule for the specific activity code.** Capital floors vary materially by activity even within "service" or "trading" categories.
4. **Default to higher rather than lower paid-up capital** where there is uncertainty: under-capitalisation triggers MISA queries and bank reluctance to open accounts.
5. **Default to genuine Saudization from day 1.** Even before Nitaqat bites, hiring Saudi nationals positions the business well for tier progression and government-contract eligibility.
6. **Default to voluntary VAT registration** if turnover is expected to approach SAR 375,000 within 12 months — avoids the disruption of mid-year mandatory registration and allows input-VAT recovery on setup costs.
7. **Default to a Saudi-resident General Manager** for the LLC (whether Saudi national or expat with valid iqama) — many banks will not open accounts otherwise, and physical presence accelerates MoC / ZATCA / GOSI interactions.
8. **Default to refusing nominee / tasattur arrangements.** Anti-Concealment Law penalties (up to SAR 5M and 5 years' imprisonment) are real. Where genuine Saudi participation is sought, document substance properly.
9. **Default to flagging — not claiming — the RHQ Program** unless the multinational genuinely has regional substance and qualifying activities. RHQ qualification is a specialist exercise; do not over-promise the 30-year tax holiday.
10. **Default to confirming sectoral licences before formation kick-off.** A green-light recommendation on entity formation is meaningless if the sector regulator (SAMA, CMA, CITC, MoH, etc.) ultimately blocks operation.
11. **Default to verifying transfer pricing thresholds** for any intercompany arrangement; ZATCA TP audits are active and penalties for late / missing Local File or Master File documentation are material.
12. **Default to electronic notarisation** via the MoC portal where available — faster than in-person notary public visits.
13. **Default to recommending professional tax / legal sign-off** on the final structure before MISA submission. Saudi formation involves cross-ministry coordination (MISA, MoC, ZATCA, GOSI, MHRSD, municipality, sector regulator) that benefits from specialist project management.
