## SallaApp/ZATCA

- Repository: [SallaApp/ZATCA](https://github.com/SallaApp/ZATCA)
- License: MIT
- Language: PHP
- Stars: 160
- Scope: ZATCA (Fatoora) e-invoicing implementation maintained by Salla (Saudi e-commerce platform). Covers Phase 1 QR code generation and Phase 2 invoice signing (CSR generation, XML signing, ZATCA API integration). TLV encoding for the 5 mandatory QR fields (seller name, VAT registration number, timestamp, invoice total, VAT total). Includes certificate handling for ZATCA's FATOORA platform.
- Tax computation data: Confirms VAT is a single-rate system (examples use 15%). TLV Tag 5 = invoice VAT total. Confirms 15-digit TIN format. No standalone rate tables — the VAT rate is passed as a parameter, not hardcoded.
- Integration: MIT — fully compatible. Reference for ZATCA e-invoicing QR code and signing workflows. Useful for validating e-invoice compliance assertions in the VAT skill (Section 5.10).

## wes4m/zatca-xml-js

- Repository: [wes4m/zatca-xml-js](https://github.com/wes4m/zatca-xml-js)
- License: MIT
- Language: TypeScript
- Stars: 88
- Scope: Full ZATCA e-invoicing implementation covering Phase 1 and Phase 2. Generates UBL 2.1 XML invoices, handles CSR/certificate lifecycle with ZATCA sandbox and production APIs, signs invoices with ECDSA, and generates QR codes. Includes ZATCA's official PDF specification documents in `/docs`.
- Tax computation data: Confirms key tax constants embedded in invoice construction:
  - `VAT_percent: 0.15` in sample line items (standard 15% rate)
  - Tax category `S` (standard-rated) and `O` (out of scope / zero-rated) per UN/ECE 5305
  - Invoice type codes: 388 (Tax Invoice), 383 (Debit Note), 381 (Credit Note) per UN/CEFACT 1001
  - Payment method codes: 10 (Cash), 30 (Credit), 42 (Bank Account), 48 (Bank Card)
  - Currency hardcoded to SAR
  - VAT computation: `line_item_subtotal × VAT_percent` with rounding rules (BR-KSA-DEC-02, BR-KSA-DEC-03)
  - Tax-inclusive amount: `tax_exclusive_amount + total_taxes`
  - QR TLV structure: 9 tags for Phase 2 (seller name, VAT number, timestamp, total, VAT total, invoice hash, digital signature, public key, certificate signature)
- Integration: MIT — fully compatible. The most complete open-source ZATCA implementation. Invoice type codes and payment method codes could supplement the VAT skill's e-invoicing section. The ZATCA specification PDFs in `/docs` are valuable primary source references.

## axenda/zatca

- Repository: [axenda/zatca](https://github.com/axenda/zatca)
- License: MIT
- Language: TypeScript
- Stars: 60
- Scope: Lightweight ZATCA QR code generator for Phase 1 e-invoicing. Generates TLV-encoded QR codes from the 5 mandatory invoice fields. Works in both frontend (browser) and backend (Node.js) environments. Validated against ZATCA's official SDK output.
- Tax computation data: Minimal — the package takes invoice total and VAT total as string inputs (`invoiceTotal: '100.00'`, `invoiceVatTotal: '15.00'`). The test examples consistently use 15% VAT (15.00 on 100.00 total). No rate computation logic — the VAT amount is pre-calculated by the caller.
- Integration: MIT — fully compatible. Simple reference for QR code TLV encoding. Validates the QR field structure used in the VAT skill's e-invoicing section.

## Assessment: Tax computation content

These three repos are **e-invoicing tools**, not tax computation engines. They handle invoice formatting, signing, and ZATCA API compliance — the VAT rate and amounts are inputs, not computed from rate tables. Key findings:

| Data point | Present in repos? | Already in VAT skill? |
|---|---|---|
| Standard VAT rate 15% | Yes (as parameter/example) | Yes (Section 1, 5.1) |
| Zero-rated / exempt categories | Partially (category codes S/O only) | Yes (detailed in Sections 5.2, 5.3) |
| Tax category codes (UN/ECE 5305) | Yes (S, O) | Implicit in field mappings |
| Invoice type codes (388/383/381) | Yes | Not explicitly listed |
| Payment method codes | Yes (10/30/42/48) | Not explicitly listed |
| VAT computation formula | Yes (subtotal × rate) | Yes (Section 5.14) |
| Withholding tax rates on non-residents | No | No |
| Zakat computation rules (2.5% on net assets) | No | No (out of scope for VAT skill) |
| Registration thresholds | No | Yes (SAR 40M monthly/quarterly) |
| Penalty rules | No | Yes (Section 5.11, 5.12) |

**Conclusion:** No material tax computation data to extract from these repos beyond what the existing skill already covers. The repos are useful as e-invoicing implementation references and for cross-validating the invoice structure and category codes documented in the VAT skill.

### Withholding tax and zakat — data gap

None of the three repos contain withholding tax rate tables or zakat computation rules. These are separate ZATCA obligations:

- **Withholding tax (WHT):** 5% on management fees, 15% on royalties, 5% on rent, 20% on payments for services rendered in KSA — rates set by the Income Tax Law (Royal Decree No. M/1). A WHT skill would need to be authored from ZATCA's published WHT rate schedules, not from these e-invoicing repos.
- **Zakat:** 2.5% on the zakat base (net adjusted assets × Saudi/GCC ownership percentage) — governed by the Zakat Collection Regulations. These e-invoicing repos do not touch zakat computation. A zakat skill would need to be authored from ZATCA's zakat guidelines and the Implementing Regulations.
