## Section 2: Quick reference

### Threshold

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| ND net tax liability threshold | **More than $1,000** [VERIFY] |
| Federal trigger (required by §57-38-62) | Taxpayer must also be required to pay federal estimated tax |

### Safe harbor (lower of)

| Test | Amount |
|---|---|
| (a) Current-year test | **90%** of TY 2025 ND net tax liability |
| (b) Prior-year test | **100%** of TY 2024 ND net tax liability |
| (c) Qualified farmer / fisherman | 66⅔% of current-year liability |

> **Note on the 110% high-income variant.** Unlike federal Form 2210 — which
> requires 110% of the prior year for taxpayers with prior-year AGI over
> $150,000 — North Dakota's statute and Schedule ND-1UT use a **flat 100%
> prior-year** test with no high-income step-up. [VERIFY against the 2025
> Schedule ND-1UT instructions before relying on this for high-AGI clients.]

### Four installment due dates (TY 2025 calendar-year filer)

| Installment | Due date | Percentage of annual required payment |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2025 | 25% |
| Q2 | June 15, 2025 | 25% |
| Q3 | September 15, 2025 | 25% |
| Q4 | January 15, 2026 | 25% |

Same calendar as federal Form 1040-ES.

### Underpayment interest rate

| Period | Rate |
|---|---|
| TY 2025 | **12% per annum**, simple interest, computed from each installment due date to the earlier of the date paid or the original Form ND-1 due date (April 15, 2026) [VERIFY: confirm rate in 2025 Schedule ND-1UT instructions] |

### Payment methods

| Method | Notes |
|---|---|
| ND Taxpayer Access Point (TAP) | https://apps.nd.gov/tax/tap — ACH debit, credit card |
| Paper check + Form ND-1ES voucher | Make check payable to "ND State Tax Commissioner" |
| Direct debit via TAP scheduled payments | Schedule all four installments in advance |
| Credit / debit card via TAP | Third-party convenience fees apply |

No electronic-payment mandate currently published for individual estimated tax at any threshold. [VERIFY]

## Section 3: Threshold determination — when must you make estimated payments

Per N.D.C.C. §57-38-62 and the Form ND-1ES instructions, a North Dakota
individual taxpayer **must** make estimated payments if **both** of the following
are true for the tax year:

1. The taxpayer is required to pay federal estimated income tax (i.e., the
   federal safe-harbor rules of IRC §6654 would otherwise impose a federal
   underpayment penalty); **and**
2. The taxpayer's expected **ND net tax liability** for the year exceeds
   **$1,000** [VERIFY].

**ND net tax liability** = ND income tax (Form ND-1, Line 22 area) **less**
allowable credits and **less** ND income tax withheld (W-2 Box 17 and 1099
ND-source withholding).

### Practical decision tree

- If withholding + credits ≥ 100% of prior-year ND tax → no estimates required
  (safe-harbor met by withholding alone).
- If expected ND liability ≤ $1,000 after withholding → no estimates required
  (de minimis).
- If neither of the above → estimates required; compute safe harbor in Section 4.

### Statutory de minimis exception (N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3)(d))

Interest is waived where current-year tax liability **exceeds withholding by
less than $500**, even if estimates were technically required. This is a
penalty-relief rule, not a filing exemption — the taxpayer should still make
estimated payments where prudent.

---

## Section 4: Safe-harbor calculation

The taxpayer's **required annual payment** is the **lesser of**:

- **(a) Current-year safe harbor:** 90% of the ND net tax liability shown on the
  current-year Form ND-1; or
- **(b) Prior-year safe harbor:** 100% of the ND net tax liability shown on the
  prior-year Form ND-1.

The prior-year test is unavailable if:
- The prior-year return was not filed; or
- The prior-year return covered fewer than 12 months; or
- The taxpayer had no ND tax liability in the prior year (in which case current
  year is the only test).

### Worked safe-harbor calc

A taxpayer's TY 2024 ND tax was $4,000. They expect TY 2025 ND tax of $6,800.

- 90% × $6,800 = $6,120 (current-year)
- 100% × $4,000 = $4,000 (prior-year) ← **lesser**

Required annual payment = **$4,000**.

If TY 2025 withholding will be $1,200, the four installments must collectively
total at least $4,000 − $1,200 = **$2,800**, i.e., **$700 per quarter** under
the regular installment method.

### Joint vs. separate prior year

If the taxpayer was MFS in the prior year and is MFJ in the current year, the
prior-year tests for both spouses are **summed** to determine the joint
prior-year safe harbor (N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02).

---

## Section 5: Regular installment method — the four equal payments

Once the required annual payment is fixed, the **regular installment method**
allocates **25% to each quarter**:

| Q | Cumulative required by due date | Marginal Q payment |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | 25% × annual | 25% |
| Q2 | 50% × annual | 25% |
| Q3 | 75% × annual | 25% |
| Q4 | 100% × annual | 25% |

ND withholding is deemed paid **evenly across the four quarters** unless the
taxpayer elects to treat it as paid when actually withheld (rare and
disadvantageous).

The taxpayer satisfies each quarterly threshold by the sum of (a) ¼ of expected
withholding **plus** (b) the ND-1ES voucher payment for that quarter.

---

## Section 6: Annualized income installment method

Where income is **lumpy or back-loaded** (e.g., a freelancer who closes a major
contract in Q3, or an S-corp shareholder receiving a December distribution),
the regular ¼-each-quarter method overstates Q1/Q2 requirements. The
**annualized income installment method** lets the taxpayer match installment
size to actual cumulative income.

ND follows the federal Schedule AI approach by reference: if the taxpayer
**utilizes the annualized income installment method for federal purposes**, the
ND underpayment interest is waived to the corresponding extent (N.D. Admin Code
81-03-04-02(3)(c)).

### Annualization factors (calendar-year)

| Installment | Period ending | Months | Annualization factor | Installment % |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | March 31 | 3 | × 4 | 22.5% (90% / 4) |
| Q2 | May 31 | 5 | × 2.4 | 45% cumulative |
| Q3 | August 31 | 8 | × 1.5 | 67.5% cumulative |
| Q4 | December 31 | 12 | × 1 | 90% cumulative |

The taxpayer must complete the annualized worksheet (federal Schedule AI is the
template; ND does not publish a standalone state annualization schedule — the
federal schedule is attached or reproduced in support of Schedule ND-1UT
columns).

### Worked example — Q3 income spike

A freelance software developer in Fargo expects $140,000 of ND-taxable income
for TY 2025, but the income arrives as follows:

| Period through | Cumulative ND taxable income | Annualized | Tax at ND rates (single) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mar 31 | $12,000 | $48,000 | $0 (within 0% bracket) |
| May 31 | $24,000 | $57,600 | $178 |
| Aug 31 | $60,000 | $90,000 | $810 |
| Dec 31 | $140,000 | $140,000 | $1,786 |

Annualized required installment amounts (90% × annualized tax × installment
percent):

| Q | Cumulative required (rounded) | Marginal Q payment |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | 22.5% × $0 = $0 | $0 |
| Q2 | 45% × $178 = $80 | $80 |
| Q3 | 67.5% × $810 = $547 | $467 |
| Q4 | 90% × $1,786 = $1,607 | $1,060 |

Versus the regular method (¼ × $1,607 = ~$402 per quarter), the annualized
method shifts ~$800 of payment from Q1/Q2 into Q3/Q4 while still avoiding
underpayment interest.

Attach a reproduction of the federal annualization worksheet to Schedule
ND-1UT when filing Form ND-1.

---

## Section 7: Form ND-1ES voucher mechanics

Form ND-1ES is a **single-page voucher** (one per installment). The taxpayer
prepares one voucher per quarter when paying by check.

### Voucher fields

| Field | Source |
|---|---|
| Tax year | "2025" (or the year the installment relates to) |
| Installment number | 1, 2, 3, or 4 |
| Name, SSN, spouse SSN if joint | From last filed Form ND-1 |
| Mailing address | Current address |
| Amount paid | The quarterly installment |

### Mailing address

> Office of State Tax Commissioner
> PO Box 5622
> Bismarck, ND 58506-5622

[VERIFY: confirm address from current 2025 ND-1ES voucher]

### TAP electronic payment

For TAP payments, **no paper voucher is required** — the electronic posting
through TAP serves as the voucher. The taxpayer logs into
https://apps.nd.gov/tax/tap and selects "Make a Payment" → "Individual Income
Tax" → "Estimated Payment."

### Recordkeeping

The taxpayer should retain confirmation numbers (TAP) or cancelled checks for
each installment to support Form ND-1 Line 27 (Estimated payments) when filing
the annual return.

---

## Section 8: Underpayment interest — Schedule ND-1UT

If any installment is underpaid (paid late or paid in a smaller amount than the
required installment), the taxpayer owes **underpayment interest** computed on
**Schedule ND-1UT** (SFN 28704). The Schedule attaches to Form ND-1.

### Computation outline (simplified)

For each of the four installments:

1. Compute the **required installment** (¼ of the required annual payment, OR
   the annualized installment if Schedule AI is used).
2. Compute **payments applied to that installment**: ¼ of withholding + ND-1ES
   payments made by or before the installment due date.
3. **Underpayment** = (1) − (2), if positive.
4. **Days outstanding** = from installment due date to the earlier of (a)
   the date the underpayment is paid (via a later ND-1ES voucher or April-15
   balance due) or (b) April 15, 2026.
5. **Interest** = Underpayment × 12% × (Days / 365).

The sum of the four interest computations flows to Form ND-1 as additional
amount due.

### Statutory waivers (N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3))

Interest may be **waived** in any of the following cases:

| Subsection | Waiver |
|---|---|
| (3)(a) | Qualified farmer who files federal return by March 1 and pays federal in full by that date |
| (3)(b) | Qualified farmer making one combined federal+state installment by January 15 |
| (3)(c) | Taxpayer using the federal annualized income installment method (state interest waived in proportion) |
| (3)(d) | De minimis — current-year liability exceeds withholding by less than $500 |

### Reasonable-cause waiver

The Tax Commissioner may waive interest under general reasonable-cause
authority (illness, casualty, disaster, or other circumstance preventing
timely payment). The taxpayer requests waiver in a signed statement attached
to Form ND-1. [VERIFY: confirm administrative process in the current ND-1
booklet.]

## Section 9: Payment methods

### ND Taxpayer Access Point (TAP)

- URL: https://apps.nd.gov/tax/tap
- Login required (one-time enrollment for new users)
- Payment types: ACH debit (free), credit/debit card (third-party convenience
  fee, ~2.5%)
- Confirmation: emailed receipt with confirmation number
- Scheduling: all four installments can be scheduled in advance from a single
  TAP session — recommended for steady-income clients

### Paper check + Form ND-1ES voucher

- Make payable to "ND State Tax Commissioner"
- Write SSN and "2025 ND-1ES" on the memo line
- Mail with the printed voucher to the Bismarck PO Box [VERIFY current address]
- USPS postmark date controls timeliness

### Direct debit via TAP scheduled payments

- Same as TAP but the taxpayer sets the debit dates in advance for all four
  quarters
- Useful for clients who want set-and-forget compliance

### No electronic mandate

ND does not currently impose an electronic-payment mandate on individual
estimated tax at any threshold [VERIFY against current Tax Commissioner
guidance], though TAP is strongly recommended.

---

## Section 10: Coordination with federal Form 1040-ES

The ND quarterly calendar **aligns exactly** with the federal Form 1040-ES
calendar:

| Installment | Federal 1040-ES | ND-1ES |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2025 | April 15, 2025 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2025 | June 15, 2025 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2025 | September 15, 2025 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2026 | January 15, 2026 |

### Practical workflow

1. Compute the federal required annual payment on Form 1040-ES worksheet (90%
   current / 100% or 110% prior depending on prior-year AGI).
2. Compute the ND required annual payment using the **state** safe-harbor
   tests (90% / flat 100% — no 110% step-up).
3. Schedule both federal (IRS Direct Pay or EFTPS) and state (ND TAP) payments
   for the same four dates.
4. If the federal taxpayer uses the annualized income installment method on
   federal Schedule AI, propagate the annualization to Schedule ND-1UT to
   preserve the state interest waiver under N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3)(c).

### Independence of safe harbors

The federal and ND safe harbors are **independent** — meeting the federal safe
harbor does not satisfy the ND safe harbor. A taxpayer who is paid up federally
via withholding alone may still owe ND estimates if their ND-1 line 27 prior-
year amount is low (e.g., due to W-2 withholding being primarily federal with
little ND-source withholding).

## Section 11: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| Rule ID | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NDES-T1-01 | Estimated tax required if expected ND net tax liability > $1,000 AND federal estimated tax is also required | N.D.C.C. §57-38-62; Form ND-1ES instructions |
| NDES-T1-02 | Safe harbor = lesser of (a) 90% current year OR (b) 100% prior year | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02 |
| NDES-T1-03 | No 110% high-income variant — flat 100% prior-year test [VERIFY] | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02 |
| NDES-T1-04 | Four equal installments due April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 | Form ND-1ES |
| NDES-T1-05 | Underpayment interest rate = 12% per annum simple [VERIFY for TY 2025] | Schedule ND-1UT instructions |
| NDES-T1-06 | Withholding deemed paid evenly unless taxpayer elects otherwise | Schedule ND-1UT |
| NDES-T1-07 | De minimis waiver if current-year tax exceeds withholding by < $500 | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3)(d) |
| NDES-T1-08 | Qualified farmer (>⅔ gross from farming) — single Jan 15 installment OR March 1 file + pay | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3)(a),(b) |
| NDES-T1-09 | Annualized installment method per federal Schedule AI waives state interest in proportion | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02(3)(c) |
| NDES-T1-10 | Prior-year safe harbor unavailable if prior return not filed or < 12 months | N.D. Admin Code 81-03-04-02 |

---

## Section 12: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Situation | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| NDES-T2-01 | **Q3 / Q4 income spike** (S-corp distribution, contract close) | Consider annualized installment method; preserve federal Schedule AI for state interest waiver |
| NDES-T2-02 | **Mid-year ND move-in** | Part-year residents fall outside this skill (see Refusal R-NDES-04); coordinate with Schedule ND-1NR |
| NDES-T2-03 | **Spousal status change** (MFS to MFJ between years) | Combine both spouses' prior-year ND liabilities for the joint 100% test |
| NDES-T2-04 | **High W-2 withholding shortfall** | If W-2 withholding alone satisfies 100% prior-year, no estimates required; verify ND-source withholding (Box 17), not federal |
| NDES-T2-05 | **Newly self-employed (first year)** | No prior-year ND-1 → only 90% current-year test available; build cushion into Q1 |
| NDES-T2-06 | **Year-end Roth conversion or capital gain** | Annualize installment method may eliminate Q1/Q2 underpayment for a Q4 event |
| NDES-T2-07 | **K-1 income from out-of-state PTE** | Coordinate with ND credit for taxes paid to other states (Schedule ND-1CR) before sizing estimates |
| NDES-T2-08 | **Reasonable-cause waiver** | Illness, casualty, disaster — attach signed statement to Form ND-1; outcome at Commissioner's discretion |

---

## Section 13: Worked examples

### Example 1 — Steady-income ND freelancer ($120,000 expected)

**Facts.** Single, full-year ND resident, Bismarck. Freelance software
developer. TY 2024 ND tax was $1,420. Expects TY 2025 net Schedule C income of
$120,000, federal taxable income of $97,500 after standard deduction and QBI.
No W-2 withholding. No prior-year safe harbor issues.

**ND tax computation (TY 2025 single, federal taxable income $97,500):**

| Bracket | Amount | Rate | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0 – $48,475 | $48,475 | 0% | $0 |
| $48,475 – $97,500 | $49,025 | 1.95% | $956 |
| **TY 2025 ND tax** | | | **$956** |

**Safe harbor:**

- 90% × $956 (current) = $860
- 100% × $1,420 (prior) = $1,420
- **Lesser = $860**

But $860 < $1,000 threshold and prior-year exceeded $1,000? Prior year was
$1,420. **Threshold is on the expected current-year liability ($956)** — at
$956 the taxpayer is **not required** to make estimates (below $1,000) [VERIFY
that threshold tests expected current-year ND tax rather than prior-year].

However, prudent practice is to pay anyway to avoid surprises. If the taxpayer
elects to pay:

| Installment | Date | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2025 | $215 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2025 | $215 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2025 | $215 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2026 | $215 |
| **Total** | | **$860** |

Pay via ND TAP scheduled debits.

### Example 2 — Self-employed with Q3 income spike (annualized method)

**Facts.** Single, ND resident, Fargo. Software consultant. TY 2024 ND tax was
$3,200. Expects TY 2025 federal taxable income of $185,000 from a Q3 contract
close. Income flow:

| Cumulative through | FTI |
|---|---|
| Mar 31 | $20,000 |
| May 31 | $35,000 |
| Aug 31 | $145,000 |
| Dec 31 | $185,000 |

**TY 2025 ND tax (single, FTI $185,000):**

| Bracket | Tax |
|---|---|
| $48,475 – $185,000 → $136,525 × 1.95% = $2,662 |
| **TY 2025 ND tax** | **$2,662** |

**Safe harbor:**

- 90% × $2,662 = $2,396
- 100% × $3,200 = $3,200
- **Lesser = $2,396** (required annual payment)

**Regular installment method:** $2,396 / 4 = **$599 per quarter** — would
require $599 by April 15 even though only $20k of income has materialized.

**Annualized installment method (using federal Schedule AI):**

Annualized tax at each cutoff:

| Period | Cumulative FTI | × Factor | Annualized FTI | ND tax | × 90% × Cum % | Required cum |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | $20,000 | 4 | $80,000 | $615 | × 22.5% | $138 |
| Q2 | $35,000 | 2.4 | $84,000 | $693 | × 45% | $312 |
| Q3 | $145,000 | 1.5 | $217,500 | (top bracket) ~$3,725 | × 67.5% | $2,514 |
| Q4 | $185,000 | 1 | $185,000 | $2,662 | × 90% | $2,396 |

**Marginal installments under annualized method:**

| Q | Required cum | Marginal |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | $138 | $138 |
| Q2 | $312 | $174 |
| Q3 | $2,514 | $2,202 |
| Q4 | $2,396 (capped) | $0 [VERIFY: cap mechanics in 2025 Schedule ND-1UT] |

The annualization defers ~$2,000 of Q1/Q2 payment exposure into Q3, matching
income timing. Attach federal Schedule AI to Schedule ND-1UT.

### Example 3 — High-income earner with W-2 withholding shortfall

**Facts.** MFJ, both spouses ND residents. Primary spouse W-2 wages $280,000
with ND withholding of $4,800. Secondary spouse Schedule C net profit
$60,000. TY 2024 ND tax was $5,900. Expects TY 2025 federal taxable income of
$305,000, ND tax of $6,775.

**Safe harbor:**

- 90% × $6,775 (current) = $6,098
- 100% × $5,900 (prior) = $5,900
- **Lesser = $5,900**

> Note: federal would apply 110% × $5,900 = $6,490 because prior-year AGI
> > $150,000. **ND does NOT apply the 110% step-up** [VERIFY] — the state
> safe harbor remains a flat $5,900.

**Coverage check.** Withholding $4,800 satisfies $4,800 of the $5,900
requirement. Remaining gap: **$1,100**.

**Quarterly installments:** $1,100 / 4 = **$275 per quarter** via ND-1ES.

| Installment | Date | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2025 | $275 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2025 | $275 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2025 | $275 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2026 | $275 |

Federal Form 1040-ES installments will be larger because the 110% federal
prior-year test produces a higher required annual payment. The state and
federal calendars are aligned; the amounts differ.

## Section 14: Refusal catalogue

| Refusal ID | Trigger | Response |
|---|---|---|
| R-NDES-01 | Estate or trust estimated tax | "ND fiduciary estimated payments (Form 38-ES) are not covered by this skill — fiduciary rules differ from individual rules under N.D.C.C. Chapter 57-38." |
