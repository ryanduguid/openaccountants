## Section 3: North Dakota personal income tax withholding

### 3.1 Statutory basis

N.D.C.C. § 57-38-59 requires every employer maintaining an office or
transacting business within ND, and making payment of any wages subject to ND
income tax, to deduct and withhold the tax. The withholding obligation
parallels the federal obligation under IRC § 3402 and applies to wages of:

- ND residents, regardless of where services are performed; **and**
- Nonresidents, to the extent services are performed within ND
  (subject to the MN and MT reciprocity exemptions below).

### 3.2 HB 1158 of 2023 — phase-down context

In April 2023 the 68th Legislative Assembly enacted **HB 1158**, the largest
individual income tax relief package in ND history. The Act:

- collapsed the prior five-bracket structure to **three** brackets;
- created a **0% bottom bracket** that exempts the first tranche of taxable
  income for every filer; and
- set the remaining two positive brackets at **1.95%** and **2.50%**.

The bracket thresholds are indexed annually. Practitioners must re-verify
the bracket thresholds for each tax year against the Tax Commissioner's
withholding booklet because (a) the indexing adjustments are non-trivial
and (b) the legislature has shown a pattern (cf. NC SB 105 and GA HB 111) of
making mid-cycle adjustments where revenue triggers are met.

### 3.3 TY 2025 brackets — single filer (withholding booklet)

[VERIFY: 2025 ND Withholding Booklet, percentage method, Table 1A]

| Taxable wages over | But not over | Withhold |
|---|---|---|
| $0 | $47,150 | $0 |
| $47,150 | $238,200 | 1.95% of excess over $47,150 |
| $238,200 | — | $3,725.48 + 2.50% of excess over $238,200 |

### 3.4 TY 2025 brackets — married filing jointly (withholding booklet)

[VERIFY: 2025 ND Withholding Booklet, percentage method, Table 1B]

| Taxable wages over | But not over | Withhold |
|---|---|---|
| $0 | $78,775 | $0 |
| $78,775 | $289,975 | 1.95% of excess over $78,775 |
| $289,975 | — | $4,118.40 + 2.50% of excess over $289,975 |

### 3.5 Supplemental wage rate

Supplemental wages (bonuses, commissions, severance, back pay, retroactive
pay, awards) paid separately from regular wages, or separately identified on
the pay stub, may be withheld at a **flat 1.5%** for 2025. Alternatively, the
employer may use the aggregate method (combine with regular wages, compute
withholding on the total, subtract regular-wage withholding).

### 3.6 Pay-period frequency

The Tax Commissioner publishes percentage method tables and wage-bracket
tables for the following frequencies: weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly,
quarterly, semiannual, annual, daily/miscellaneous. The percentage method is
mandatory for software-driven payroll; wage-bracket tables remain authoritative
for manual payroll under $1 million in wages.

---

## Section 4: Form NDW-M and choice of method

### 4.1 What NDW-M is

Form **NDW-M** ("Withholding Allowance Certificate for Pension or Annuity
Payments and Employee's State of Residence") is the ND state equivalent of
federal Form W-4. Effective from 2020 onward, ND defaults to using the
**federal Form W-4** for state withholding purposes (no separate state W-4
required for the vast majority of employees). NDW-M is used only for:

- pension and annuity payees electing ND withholding; and
- employees who want different ND elections from their federal W-4
  elections (rare).

### 4.2 Method election

Employers may use either:

- **Percentage method** — required for computer payroll. Uses the bracket
  tables in §§ 3.3–3.4.
- **Wage bracket method** — published tables in the 2025 Withholding Booklet,
  acceptable for manual payroll only.

### 4.3 Employee with no W-4 on file

Where an employee has not furnished a federal Form W-4 to the employer, the
employer must withhold ND tax as if the employee had checked **Single with no
adjustments** on the W-4 (consistent with the IRS § 3402 default).

---

## Section 5: Minnesota–North Dakota reciprocity — AUDIT FLASH POINT

### 5.1 Statutory and historical basis

ND and MN have maintained an income tax reciprocity arrangement since 1957,
**suspended in tax years 2003 and 2004**, and **re-negotiated effective
January 1, 2005**. The agreement is supported on the ND side by N.D.C.C.
§ 57-38-59.1 and on the MN side by Minn. Stat. § 290.081. Both states issue
parallel guidance each filing season confirming the agreement remains in
force.

Under the agreement, **wage and salary income** paid for personal services
performed in ND by an MN resident is taxable only in MN; and vice versa for
ND residents working in MN. The agreement does **not** cover:

- self-employment, partnership, S-corporation, or rental income;
- gambling winnings;
- income from a closely-held business that is not wage compensation; or
- lottery/contest winnings.

### 5.2 Mechanics — Form NDW-R

To stop ND withholding on a qualifying MN resident's wages, the **employee**
must give the **employer** a completed Form NDW-R ("Reciprocity Exemption
from Withholding for Qualifying Minnesota and Montana Residents Working in
North Dakota").

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Employee completes NDW-R, swearing under penalty of perjury that they are a permanent MN (or MT) resident | By Feb 28 each year, or within 30 days of starting work / changing residence |
| 2 | Employer stops ND withholding from the next available payroll | Effective immediately on receipt |
| 3 | Employer mails the Tax Commissioner's copy of NDW-R to the ND Office of State Tax Commissioner | By March 31 each year |
| 4 | Employee renews NDW-R every year | Annually — prior-year form does not roll over |

The employer **must** withhold **Minnesota** income tax instead (under MN
Stat. § 290.92), which requires the employer to register for an MN
withholding account if not already registered.

### 5.3 What happens if the NDW-R is missing — the audit flash point

If a qualifying MN resident's employer fails to obtain a current-year NDW-R,
ND requires the employer to **withhold ND tax from the employee's wages**
notwithstanding the underlying reciprocity. The employee's recourse is then
to file Form ND-EZ at year-end claiming a full refund of the ND tax
withheld — a 6-to-12-month cash-flow hit for the employee, and a common
source of complaints against employers.

Common employer errors:

1. **Treating the NDW-R as evergreen.** It is not. Each calendar year
   requires a fresh NDW-R.
2. **Failing to mail the Tax Commissioner copy by March 31.** This is a
   filing obligation on the **employer**, not the employee. Penalty exposure
   under N.D.C.C. § 57-38-45.
3. **Forgetting to register for MN withholding.** The employer must withhold
   MN tax. Failure to do so creates an MN delinquent-employer status.
4. **Continuing the exemption after the employee moves to ND.** If the
   employee's residence changes mid-year, the employer must restart ND
   withholding immediately.
5. **Applying the exemption to self-employed contractors.** NDW-R covers
   wages only.

### 5.4 Who can use NDW-R

Eligibility requires the employee to be:

- a permanent resident of MN or MT for the entire tax year;
- maintain a permanent home in MN or MT throughout the year; and
- not maintain a permanent home in ND.

A taxpayer who maintains an apartment in Fargo for convenience while keeping
a permanent home in Moorhead, MN, generally qualifies. A taxpayer who has
moved their permanent residence to Fargo does not, regardless of where their
driver's license is issued.

---

## Section 6: Montana–North Dakota reciprocity

The ND-MT reciprocity agreement has been in force since 1976. The mechanics
mirror the MN agreement:

- A qualifying MT resident files Form **NDW-R** with their ND employer.
- The employer stops ND withholding and starts MT withholding.
- The agreement covers wage and salary income only.
- The same Feb 28 / March 31 deadlines apply.

The MT side of the agreement is administered by the MT Department of
Revenue under § 15-30-2110, MCA. MT residents working in ND are not common
in practice — the population centers are remote from the MT border — but
oilfield and pipeline workers in Williston/Bakken can hit this regularly.

---

## Section 7: Quarterly Form 306 reporting

### 7.1 Form and due dates

Form **306** ("Income Tax Withholding Return") is the quarterly
remittance/reconciliation return. Due dates:

| Quarter | Period | Due date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | January 1 – March 31 | April 30 |
| Q2 | April 1 – June 30 | July 31 |
| Q3 | July 1 – September 30 | October 31 |
| Q4 | October 1 – December 31 | January 31 |

When the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the next
business day is the deadline.

### 7.2 Mandatory electronic filing

An employer whose ND withholding totaled **$1,000 or more** for the prior
calendar year **must** file Form 306 electronically through the **ND
Taxpayer Access Point (TAP)** at https://apps.nd.gov/tax/tap. Payment is via
ACH Debit (initiated within TAP) or ACH Credit (initiated through the
employer's bank). Paper Form 306 is available only for employers below the
$1,000 threshold.

### 7.3 No deposit-frequency election

Unlike federal Form 941 (which is paired with semiweekly or monthly deposit
schedules), ND does **not** require interim deposits. The full quarterly
liability is paid with Form 306 on the quarter-end deadline. Practitioners
migrating from CA, NY, or IL frequently over-engineer this — there is no ND
analog to those interim deposit schedules.

### 7.4 Penalties

- **Late filing**: 5% of tax due, minimum $5, per N.D.C.C. § 57-38-45.
- **Late payment**: 5% of tax due, **plus interest** at the rate set
  annually by the Tax Commissioner (12% per annum simple for 2025
  [VERIFY: 2025 interest rate posting]).
- **Failure to file electronically** when required: $500 per return,
  per N.D.C.C. § 57-01-02.1.
- **Failure to deposit by EFT** when required to deposit electronically: up
  to 5% of underpayment.

### 7.5 Zero returns

A registered employer who paid no ND wages for the quarter must still file a
**zero Form 306**. Failure to file the zero return triggers the late-filing
penalty floor.

---

## Section 8: Annual reconciliation — Form 307 + W-2/1099

### 8.1 Form 307

Form **307** ("Transmittal of Wage and Tax Statement") is the annual
employer reconciliation, due **January 31** of the year following the
calendar year. Form 307 is the ND analog to federal Form W-3.

It is filed electronically through TAP, together with copies of:

- all Forms **W-2** issued to employees with ND wages or ND withholding; and
- all Forms **1099** (1099-NEC, 1099-MISC, 1099-R) that reported ND
  withholding.

### 8.2 W-2 filing

For TY 2025, employers must file copies of all W-2s that report:

- wages paid to ND residents (regardless of withholding); or
- wages paid for services performed in ND; or
- ND tax withheld.

Electronic filing is required for employers issuing **10 or more** W-2s
(aligning ND with the federal 10-form threshold under T.D. 9972). The TAP
file specification follows the SSA EFW2 format with the ND state record
extension.

### 8.3 1099-NEC filing

Forms 1099-NEC reporting nonemployee compensation with ND withholding (rare
because ND does not require 1099 backup withholding the way some states do)
must be filed with the Tax Commissioner by January 31. 1099-NEC without ND
withholding need not be filed separately with ND — the federal Combined
Federal/State Filing (CF/SF) program covers this.

### 8.4 Reconciliation tie-out

The sum of ND withholding reported on the four quarterly Forms 306 must
equal the sum of ND tax withheld shown on the W-2/1099 forms transmitted
with Form 307. Mismatches trigger a Tax Commissioner desk audit.

---

## Section 9: ND State Unemployment Tax (SUTA)

### 9.1 Administration

Job Service North Dakota (JSND) administers the state unemployment insurance
program under N.D.C.C. Chapter 52-04. Employers register and file through
the **UI EASY** portal at https://www.jobsnd.com.

### 9.2 Wage base

| Year | ND SUTA taxable wage base |
|---|---|
| 2024 | $43,800 |
| **2025** | **$45,100** |
| 2026 | [VERIFY: not yet published as of 2026-05-28] |

The wage base is recalculated each year as **70% of the statewide average
annual wage**. ND's wage base is consistently among the five highest in the
US.

### 9.3 Rate structure (2025)

[VERIFY: 2025 Tax Rate Schedules from JSND]

- **Positive-balance experience rates**: 0.08% – 1.85% (Schedule 1).
- **Negative-balance rates**: up to ~9.97%.
- **New employer (non-construction)**: 1.02% on rate Schedule [VERIFY].
- **New employer (construction)**: 6.09% [VERIFY].
- Rates are issued annually in November/December for the following calendar
  year via SFN 41216.

A new employer remains on the new-employer rate until they have been liable
for ND UI for the period ending on the prior June 30 (i.e., typically 3 full
fiscal years of experience).

### 9.4 Quarterly contribution and wage report

Form **SFN 41263** is the quarterly Employer's Contribution and Wage Report,
due the **last day of the month following quarter end** (same calendar as
Form 306). Mandatory electronic filing via UI EASY for all employers as of
2018. Includes:

- gross wages by employee;
- excess wages (above the taxable wage base year-to-date);
- contribution computation; and
- SOC occupational code reporting (for ETA data) [VERIFY: still required
  2025].

### 9.5 Penalties

- Late report: $25 minimum, plus interest at 1.5% per month on unpaid
  contributions.
- Failure to file: rate increased by 1% under N.D.C.C. § 52-04-05.
- Misclassification of workers (treating employees as 1099 contractors):
  exposes employer to back contributions, penalty, and interest, and JSND
  applies the multi-factor "right to control" test more aggressively than
  many states.

---

## Section 10: New-hire reporting

### 10.1 Federal basis

PRWORA § 453A (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 653a) requires every employer to
report each newly hired employee to the designated state agency within **20
days** of the date of hire (or, for employers reporting magnetically/
electronically, in two monthly transmissions not less than 12 and not more
than 16 days apart).

### 10.2 ND-specific mechanics

- **Reporting agency**: North Dakota Child Support Division, Department of
  Health and Human Services.
- **Method**: Electronic upload via https://www.nd.gov/childsupport, fax,
  or paper W-4 with the employer's FEIN added.
- **Trigger**: Each newly hired or re-hired employee (re-hired = returning
  after a separation of 60+ days). Independent contractors paid $2,500 or
  more are **also** reportable in ND under § 14-09-09.5.
- **Data required**: Employee name, address, SSN, DOB, date of hire;
  employer name, address, FEIN.

### 10.3 Multistate-employer election

An employer with employees in two or more states may designate **a single
state** for all its new-hire reporting under 42 U.S.C. § 653a(b)(1)(B). The
designation is filed with the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement
(form found at acf.hhs.gov). An employer headquartered in MN with workers in
both MN and ND may elect to report all hires to MN — but the election
**must** be filed; absent the election, the employer must report ND hires to
ND.

---

## Section 11: Workforce Safety & Insurance (WSI)

### 11.1 The monopoly — frequently missed by out-of-state employers

ND is one of only **four** US states (with OH, WA, and WY) operating a
**monopolistic state workers' compensation fund**. WSI is the **exclusive**
provider of workers' compensation coverage in ND. A private workers'
compensation insurance policy purchased from a national carrier (Travelers,
Liberty Mutual, The Hartford, etc.) **does not satisfy** the ND coverage
requirement, and the employer is treated as uninsured.

Statutory basis: N.D.C.C. Title 65.

### 11.2 Mandatory coverage

Coverage is mandatory for **every** employer with one or more employees,
including:

- full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary employees;
- corporate officers (unless they file Form C-3 elective exclusion);
- employees of out-of-state employers performing **any** work in ND
  (a Texas-based pipeline employer sending a crew to the Bakken triggers
  WSI coverage from day 1).

Exemptions are narrow (limited to certain agricultural employers, real
estate brokers paid solely on commission, and specific independent
contractors meeting the 9-factor test).

### 11.3 Enforcement

WSI conducts compliance audits using NDDOR and JSND data feeds. Penalties
for uninsured operation under N.D.C.C. § 65-04-33:

- **Triple premium** plus penalty (typically the prior 3 years' would-be
  premium × 3);
- Personal liability of corporate officers under N.D.C.C. § 65-09-02;
- Potential **stop-work order** shutting down the ND operation; and
- Treble damages in any employee injury suit.

### 11.4 Premium computation

Premiums are based on classification code, payroll, and experience
modifier. Reporting is annual via the WSI online portal. New employers
receive an "industry average" rate for their NAICS code; experience
modification kicks in after 3 years of claims history.

### 11.5 Practical reminder for the Fargo audit

If a Texas, Florida, or even South Dakota employer expands to a Fargo
office and ports its existing national workers' comp policy, **the ND
coverage is invalid from day 1**. The employer must apply to WSI before the
first day of ND employment. This is the single most common compliance
failure for employers expanding into ND.

---

## Section 12: Final pay, garnishment, child support

### 12.1 Final paycheck

Under N.D.C.C. § 34-14-03:

- **Involuntary termination**: final pay due on the next regular payday
  (the employee may demand earlier by certified mail, in which case the
  employer must pay within 15 days).
- **Voluntary resignation**: final pay due on the next regular payday.
- Accrued, unused PTO is payable only to the extent the employer's written
  policy or contract so provides — ND default rule is no PTO payout
  obligation absent agreement.

### 12.2 Wage garnishment

ND follows federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (CCPA) limits: 25% of
disposable earnings or 30 × federal minimum wage, whichever is less. Child
support withholding orders take priority over creditor garnishments and may
take up to 50–65% of disposable income under 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b)(2).

### 12.3 Child support withholding

Employers receive an Income Withholding for Support (IWO) from the ND CSD
or another state's agency. Withholding must begin no later than the **first
pay period after 14 days** from the date the IWO was mailed. Remittance to
the ND State Disbursement Unit within 7 business days of withholding.

## Section 13: Tier 1 deterministic rules vs Tier 2 judgment rules

### 13.1 Tier 1 (deterministic — apply mechanically)

| Rule ID | Statement |
|---|---|
| T1-ND-PAY-01 | If employer's prior-year withholding ≥ $1,000, Form 306 must be filed electronically through TAP. |
| T1-ND-PAY-02 | Form 306 quarterly due dates are 4/30, 7/31, 10/31, 1/31. |
| T1-ND-PAY-03 | Form 307 annual reconciliation is due January 31. |
| T1-ND-PAY-04 | An MN or MT resident must file NDW-R **annually** to exempt wages from ND withholding. |
| T1-ND-PAY-05 | Employer must mail the Tax Commissioner copy of NDW-R by March 31. |
| T1-ND-PAY-06 | 2025 ND SUTA taxable wage base is $45,100. |
| T1-ND-PAY-07 | 2025 ND supplemental wage rate is 1.5%. |
| T1-ND-PAY-08 | New-hire reports are due to the ND CSD within 20 days of hire. |
| T1-ND-PAY-09 | ND workers' comp must be obtained from WSI — private coverage is invalid. |
| T1-ND-PAY-10 | Final pay is due on the next regular payday. |
| T1-ND-PAY-11 | An employer issuing 10+ W-2s must file them electronically with ND via TAP. |

### 13.2 Tier 2 (judgment — surface to verifier)

| Rule ID | Statement |
|---|---|

## Section 14: Worked examples

### Example 1 — Standard ND-resident employee, biweekly $2,500, single, no NDW-R

**Facts.** Anna lives in Bismarck, ND. Biweekly gross wages = $2,500.
Federal W-4 = single, no adjustments. No 401(k), no Section 125.

**Step 1 — Annualize.** $2,500 × 26 = $65,000 annual wages.

**Step 2 — Apply 2025 single bracket table** [VERIFY: 2025 booklet exact
threshold]. Assume bottom-bracket cutoff = $47,150 single.

```
Taxable above cutoff: $65,000 - $47,150 = $17,850
Annual ND tax: $17,850 × 1.95% = $348.08
Per pay period: $348.08 / 26 = $13.39
```

**Step 3 — Round.** Round per the percentage method instruction (to the
nearest whole dollar): **$13.00 withheld per biweekly pay**.

**Step 4 — Form 306, Q1.** Anna's six pays in Q1 → $13 × 6 = $78 ND tax
remitted with Form 306 by April 30. (Aggregated with all other employees.)

### Example 2 — Minnesota commuter with NDW-R on file

**Facts.** Bjorn lives in Moorhead, MN, and commutes daily to a software
job in Fargo, ND. Biweekly gross wages = $3,200. Filed NDW-R on his first
day of work, dated February 1, 2025.

**Step 1 — Verify NDW-R.** Employer confirms:
- Permanent address in MN: yes (verified driver's license + lease).
- Form signed and dated within 30 days of start: yes.
- Calendar-year specific: yes (2025).

**Step 2 — ND withholding.** **Zero ND tax withheld** on Bjorn's wages for
the entire 2025 calendar year.

**Step 3 — MN withholding.** Employer registers for an MN withholding
account and withholds MN tax under MN Stat. § 290.92 using Form W-4MN.

**Step 4 — Employer's March 31 obligation.** Employer mails the Tax
Commissioner copy of Bjorn's NDW-R to the ND Office of State Tax
Commissioner by **March 31, 2025**.

**Step 5 — Renewal.** A fresh NDW-R is required on or before **February 28,
2026** for the 2026 calendar year. The employer should diary this in
December 2025.

**Failure mode.** If Bjorn forgets to renew in February 2026 and the
employer does not collect a 2026 NDW-R, the employer **must withhold ND
tax** from his 2026 wages starting January 1, 2026 (or, in practice, the
first payroll after the Feb 28 default deadline). Bjorn then files Form
ND-EZ in 2027 to claim the ND withholding back as a refund — a real cash
flow hit, and the source of frequent payroll complaints.

### Example 3 — High-income ND-resident at the top bracket

**Facts.** Carla is a Bismarck-based oilfield engineer earning $325,000
annual salary, paid semimonthly ($13,541.67 gross per pay). Federal W-4 =
single, no adjustments. She receives a $50,000 year-end bonus.

**Regular wage withholding per pay period**

Annualize: $13,541.67 × 24 = $325,000. Apply 2025 single percentage
table [VERIFY exact thresholds]:

```
First $47,150 → 0%
$47,150 to $238,200 → 1.95% × $191,050 = $3,725.48
Above $238,200 → 2.50% × ($325,000 - $238,200) = 2.50% × $86,800 = $2,170.00
Annual ND tax = $5,895.48
Per pay (÷24) = $245.65
```

Round → **$246 ND withheld per semimonthly pay**.

**Year-end bonus — supplemental rate**

Paid on a separate check identified as a bonus:

```
$50,000 × 1.5% = $750 ND tax withheld
```

The 1.5% supplemental rate is **below** Carla's marginal rate of 2.50%, so
she will under-withhold on the bonus by approximately ($50,000 × 1.00%) =
$500. The employer is not at fault — the supplemental rate is a statutory
safe harbor — but Carla should be advised to make an ND estimated payment
on Form 540-ES [VERIFY: ND uses Form ND-1ES for estimates] to avoid a
balance due in April 2026.
