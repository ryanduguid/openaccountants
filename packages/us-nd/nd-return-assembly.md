name: nd-return-assembly
description: >
  Final capstone orchestrator that assembles the complete federal + North
  Dakota filing package for a full-year North Dakota-resident sole
  proprietor or single-member LLC disregarded for federal tax. Consumes
  outputs from every upstream federal and North Dakota content skill
  (bookkeeping, Schedule C/SE, QBI, retirement, SE health insurance,
  quarterly estimated tax, federal assembly, 1099-NEC, nd-income-tax,
  nd-estimated-tax, nd-payroll, nd-corporate-tax routing checks, and
  nd-sales-tax for closing out the indirect-tax year) to produce a single
  unified reviewer package: every worksheet, every form, every cross-skill
  reconciliation, the final taxpayer action list with payment and filing
  instructions, the next-year ND-1ES voucher schedule, and the reviewer
  brief. This skill does NOT recompute tax — it ORCHESTRATES. Trigger on
  phrases like "assemble the North Dakota return", "final ND package",
  "ND-1 reviewer package", "ND return assembly", or "package up the
  Dakota return". MUST be loaded alongside us-tax-workflow-base v0.2 or
  later and every content skill listed in Section 5. North Dakota
  full-year residents only. Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs
  disregarded for federal tax only.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, intake has already happened. The taxpayer
has consented to the full workflow. Execute every step without pausing
for permission.**

- **Do NOT ask the user "how deep do you want me to go".** The taxpayer
  asked for a North Dakota return. Produce it.
- **Do NOT announce tool budgets or token counts.** Execute.
- **Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize.** Produce every
  deliverable listed in Section 7. If you run out of context, finish the
  numbers first, then produce whatever formatted outputs you can, and
  state honestly at the end which deliverables are partial.
- **Do NOT re-validate scope intake already validated.** Residency,
  business structure, filing status, MN/MT reciprocity status, oil & gas
  income flag, tribal-enrollment flag, Renaissance Zone flag, age,
  dependents — all of that came from intake. Cross-check specific
  numbers during reconciliation but do not re-interrogate the taxpayer.
- **Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.** Run them in order
  (Section 5) without prose updates between each one. One status message
  at the end is enough.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** A failed self-check is a
  flag in the reviewer brief, not a workflow halt. The reviewer handles
  edges.
- **Primary citations live in the final reviewer brief, not in
  intermediate computation.** Don't stop to cite N.D.C.C. §57-38-30.3
  mid-bracket-multiplication.

**Failure mode to avoid:** halting mid-execution to ask a meta-question
about workflow pacing. That is disqualifying. If you feel the urge to
ask "how should I proceed," pick the most defensible path, proceed, and
flag the decision for the reviewer.

## Section 2 — What this skill is

The final capstone skill. Every other North Dakota skill and every
relevant federal skill feeds into this one. The deliverable is the
complete reviewer package that a credentialed reviewer signs off on
before filing.

The skill enforces three things:

1. **Order of operations.** Federal first, North Dakota second. The
   order is non-negotiable because **federal taxable income** (Form
   1040 Line 15, NOT federal AGI) flows into ND-1 Line 1 as the ND
   starting point. This is unusual — most states start at federal AGI;
   ND starts after the federal standard/itemized deduction AND after
   the federal QBI deduction. Every federal adjustment — Schedule C
   net profit, ½ SE tax, SE health insurance, retirement
   contributions, QBI deduction, standard or itemized deduction — is
   already baked into the starting figure before ND modifications
   apply. Unlike Michigan there is **no city-level income tax in
   North Dakota** — N.D.C.C. does not authorize municipal income tax —
   so the city step from the MI orchestrator is omitted entirely.
2. **Cross-skill reconciliation.** Every figure that appears on the
   ND-1 must match the corresponding figure produced by the source
   skill. A mismatch halts assembly with a specific, named refusal.
3. **Reviewer-grade output.** The final package is structured for a CPA
   or EA to review in under 30 minutes: cover summary, brief, exhibits
   in order, action list, citations.

---

## Section 3 — Orchestration runbook

When invoked, the agent executes the following steps in order. No step
is optional. No step is skipped without an explicit refusal.

### Step 1 — Confirm intake artifact exists

Verify the intake skill has produced:

- Taxpayer name, SSN/ITIN (last 4 only in working files)
- Filing status (Single / MFJ / MFS / HoH / QSS)
- Residency confirmation (full-year North Dakota)
- Date of birth for taxpayer and spouse (drives the federal age-65
  additional standard deduction, which feeds Line 1 starting point)
- Dependents list with SSNs (drives federal dependents — ND has no
  separate child deduction unlike NC)
- Business structure (sole prop or SMLLC disregarded)
- MN/MT reciprocity flag — taxpayer wages earned in Minnesota or
  Montana while a ND resident are exempt from those states' income
  tax under the reciprocity agreements; conversely a ND resident
  working a W-2 job in MN/MT files no MN/MT return for those wages
- Oil & gas / mineral income flag — flag-only; the orchestrator does
  not produce ND oil extraction tax filings (out of scope, see
  R-ND-FINAL-21)
- Tribal-enrollment flag — enrolled tribal members earning income on
  their reservation may take a Schedule ND-1SA subtraction
- Renaissance Zone flag — income from a designated ND Renaissance
  Zone may be exempt under N.D.C.C. §57-38-01.18
- Military retirement flag — ND fully subtracts military retirement
  pay per N.D.C.C. §57-38-30(5) `[VERIFY:]` 2025 conformity
- Social Security flag — ND fully subtracts taxable Social Security
  benefits per N.D.C.C. §57-38-30 `[VERIFY:]` 2025 statute reference
- Job Service ND unemployment benefits flag — taxable federally;
  subtracted on ND-1SA `[VERIFY:]` 2025 schedule line
- Health coverage history (federal Form 1095-A / B / C)
- W-2s, 1099-NECs, 1099-Rs received

If any item is missing, refuse with **R-ND-FINAL-5**.

### Step 2 — Confirm federal skills ran and produced outputs

Verify in order:

1. `us-sole-prop-bookkeeping` — Schedule C classification with
   reconciled bank ledger.
2. `us-schedule-c-and-se-computation` — Schedule C bottom line,
   Form 8829, Schedule SE.
3. `us-self-employed-retirement` — SEP / Solo 401(k) contribution and
   Schedule 1 Line 16 amount.
4. `us-self-employed-health-insurance` — §162(l) deduction and
   Schedule 1 Line 17 amount (with iterative PTC convergence if
   marketplace coverage).
5. `us-qbi-deduction` — Form 8995 or 8995-A, deduction to Form 1040
   Line 13. (CRITICAL — ND starts from federal taxable income, which
   is AFTER QBI. So QBI value materially reduces ND tax.)
6. `us-federal-return-assembly` — Form 1040, Schedules 1, 2, 3, all
   supporting forms, federal total tax, federal balance due / refund.
   In particular, **Form 1040 Line 15 (federal taxable income)** is
   the single most important upstream output for ND.
7. `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` — Form 2210 (if penalty) + 2026
   Form 1040-ES schedule.
8. `us-1099-nec-issuance` — Parallel; only needs bookkeeping.
   Contractor list plus W-9 gaps.

If any is missing or its self-checks did not pass, refuse with
**R-ND-FINAL-1** or **R-ND-FINAL-2** naming the specific skill.

### Step 3 — Confirm North Dakota skills ran

Execute in order:

1. `nd-income-tax` — Form ND-1, Schedule ND-1SA (additions and
   subtractions including Social Security, military retirement,
   Renaissance Zone, tribal reservation, US bond interest, Job
   Service ND unemployment), Schedule ND-1TC (credits), Schedule
   ND-1CR (credit for taxes paid to another state — if any wages
   earned outside MN/MT reciprocity zone). Produces ND taxable
   income, ND tax via the 0% / 1.95% / 2.50% bracket schedule,
   credits, refund or balance due.
2. `nd-estimated-tax` — Produces a 4-payment ND-1ES voucher schedule
   for 2026 if expected ND liability after withholding exceeds the
   $1,000 threshold per N.D.C.C. §57-38-62. Also computes any
   current-year ND underpayment interest exposure on Schedule
   ND-1UT.
3. `nd-payroll` — Flag-only at this orchestrator stage. If the
   taxpayer is also a ND withholding agent (employer), confirm
   quarterly Form 306 and annual Form 307 reconciliation status.
   Does NOT block the individual return.
4. `nd-corporate-tax` — Routing check only. If intake flagged
   anything corporate (Form 40) or pass-through (Form 58 / Form 60),
   refuse with R-ND-FINAL-10 / R-ND-FINAL-11 / R-ND-FINAL-18.

If any required skill failed or its self-check failed, refuse with
**R-ND-FINAL-1** or **R-ND-FINAL-2**.

### Step 4 — No city / local return step

North Dakota does not authorize municipal or county income tax. Skip
the city step entirely. If intake somehow flagged a "city return,"
that is an intake error — refuse with **R-ND-FINAL-7** and route back
to intake for correction.

### Step 5 — MN/MT reciprocity check

If intake flagged W-2 wages earned in Minnesota or Montana while the
taxpayer was a ND resident:

- Confirm a Form MWR (Minnesota) or equivalent Montana reciprocity
  exemption certificate was on file with the employer, so MN/MT
  income tax was NOT withheld. The wages are taxable only in ND.
- If MN or MT withholding WAS taken (employer error), the taxpayer
  must file a MN or MT non-resident return to recover the
  withholding. That filing is out of scope here — refuse with
  **R-ND-FINAL-22** and route to a multistate preparer.
- If wages were earned in any OTHER state (not MN, not MT), the
  taxpayer may need a non-resident return in that state and a ND-1CR
  credit for tax paid. Single-state simple W-2 cases proceed; complex
  multistate apportionment refuses with **R-ND-FINAL-16**.

### Step 6 — Run the verification matrix

Run every check in Section 6. Each check is a specific equality between
a number on a final form and the source-of-truth output from the
producing skill. A failure halts assembly with **R-ND-FINAL-3**.

### Step 7 — Aggregate artifacts

Pull:

- Every "Assumed" entry from every upstream skill into the
  **assumption log**.
- Every "Taxpayer input needed" item into the **taxpayer input log**.
- Every "Reviewer judgment needed" item into the **reviewer flag log**.
- Every refusal that fired anywhere in the chain into the
  **refusal log**.

### Step 8 — Compose the deliverables

Produce the three output files specified in Section 7. Place them in
`/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. Present them at the end with `present_files`.

### Step 9 — Final status message

A single message stating: which skills ran, which self-checks passed,
which deliverables were produced, any partial deliverables and why.
Done.

---

## Section 4 — Pre-flight checks

Before any of Section 3 runs, the orchestrator confirms these gating
conditions. If any fail, refuse — do not partially execute.

| Check | Question | Refusal if fails |
|---|---|---|
| PF-1 | Has federal Form 1040 been computed by `us-federal-return-assembly`? | R-ND-FINAL-1 |
| PF-2 | Is federal taxable income (Form 1040 Line 15) a finite, non-negative number? (Negative federal taxable income flows as zero into ND-1 Line 1 but flag it.) | R-ND-FINAL-1 |
| PF-3 | Has the taxpayer's full-year North Dakota residency been confirmed? | R-ND-FINAL-6 |
| PF-4 | Is the business structure sole prop or SMLLC disregarded? S-corp or partnership? | R-ND-FINAL-10 / R-ND-FINAL-11 |
| PF-5 | Is the tax year 2025? | R-ND-FINAL-12 |
| PF-6 | If MFJ: are both spouses full-year ND residents? Mixed-residency couples → refuse. | R-ND-FINAL-13 |
| PF-7 | Is this a current-year original return (not amended)? | R-ND-FINAL-14 |
| PF-8 | Did intake report any inbound K-1 from an S-corp or partnership? | R-ND-FINAL-20 |
| PF-9 | Did intake report wages earned outside ND, MN, or MT? Multi-state apportionment beyond reciprocity is out of scope. | R-ND-FINAL-16 |
| PF-10 | Did intake report oil/gas/mineral royalty income? Income tax effect is in scope; ND oil extraction tax filings (Form OG-1, etc.) are NOT. | Flag-only; refuse oil-extraction tax with R-ND-FINAL-21 |
| PF-11 | Did intake report farm income with averaging election (Schedule ND-1FA)? | In scope — confirm `nd-income-tax` produced Schedule ND-1FA |
| PF-12 | Did intake report Renaissance Zone income? | In scope — confirm subtraction documented on ND-1SA |
| PF-13 | Did intake report tribal-enrolled-member income earned on reservation? | In scope — confirm subtraction documented on ND-1SA with enrollment evidence |

---

## Section 5 — Skill-loading order (canonical execution sequence)

This is the immutable order. Do not parallelize; downstream skills
consume upstream outputs. The single exception is
`us-1099-nec-issuance`, which can run in parallel with anything after
`us-sole-prop-bookkeeping`.

```
1.  us-tax-workflow-base                         (workflow scaffold)
2.  us-sole-prop-bookkeeping                     (Schedule C classification)
3.  us-schedule-c-and-se-computation             (C, SE, 8829)
4.  us-qbi-deduction                             (8995 / 8995-A — flows into Fed Line 13, then Line 15)
5.  us-self-employed-health-insurance            (§162(l), iterative w/ PTC)
6.  us-self-employed-retirement                  (SEP / Solo 401(k))
7.  us-quarterly-estimated-tax                   (2210, 2026 1040-ES)
8.  us-federal-return-assembly                   (1040 incl. Line 15 = ND-1 Line 1)
9.  us-1099-nec-issuance                         (parallel; contractor batch)
10. nd-income-tax                                (ND-1, ND-1SA, ND-1TC, ND-1CR, ND-1FA)
11. nd-estimated-tax / ND-1ES (2026)             (next-year vouchers + ND-1UT)
12. nd-payroll                                   (flag-only if also a withholding agent)
13. nd-sales-tax                                 (status note; does not block)
14. nd-return-assembly                           ← THIS SKILL
```

Each upstream skill is expected to expose, at minimum: (a) the
line-item output(s) it produces, (b) the self-check log, (c) any
refusals fired, and (d) any reviewer / taxpayer flags. The
orchestrator consumes those four artifacts per skill.

**Note on `nd-sales-tax`.** ND sales and use tax is a separate filing
cadence (monthly / quarterly / annual via ND TAP) and does not flow
into the individual return. The orchestrator only surfaces an
end-of-year sales-tax status line ("all ND sales-tax periods filed
through Dec 2025" or "Q4 2025 ND sales-tax return due Jan 31, 2026 —
verify filed") in the action list. It does not block on sales tax.

**Note on `nd-corporate-tax`.** Pure routing check at the orchestrator
level. The sole prop / SMLLC disregarded scope means no Form 40
(corporate) or Form 58 (partnership) or Form 60 (S-corp) is produced.
If intake says otherwise, refuse.

---

## Section 6 — Verification matrix (reconciliations)

Every line below is a hard equality. Tolerance is $1 unless noted
otherwise. A failure halts assembly with **R-ND-FINAL-3** naming the
specific check.

### 6A — Federal internal consistency (re-verified)

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| F-1 | Schedule C Line 31 = Schedule 1 Line 3 = Form 1040 Line 8 (via Sch 1 to L10) | us-schedule-c-and-se-computation |

| F-13 | Refund / balance due = Form 1040 Line 34 or 37 | us-federal-return-assembly |

### 6B — North Dakota internal consistency

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| N-1 | Federal taxable income (Form 1040 Line 15) = ND-1 Line 1 (NOT federal AGI — verify the right line was pulled) | nd-income-tax |
| N-2 | ND-1SA additions total = ND-1 Line 2 | nd-income-tax |

| N-12 | ND-1 Line 17 (ND withholding) = sum of W-2 Box 17 ND + 1099 ND withholding | nd-income-tax |
| N-13 | ND-1 Line 18 (estimated payments) = sum of ND-1ES vouchers paid for TY 2025 + any extension payment | nd-estimated-tax |
| N-14 | ND-1 Line 22 (refund) OR (balance due) reconciles to total tax − total payments | nd-income-tax |
| N-15 | If Schedule ND-1UT (underpayment) applies: interest computed and added to balance due | nd-estimated-tax |

### 6C — Federal-ND coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| C-1 | Filing status on ND-1 = filing status on Form 1040 |
| C-2 | Dependents claimed on ND-1 = dependents claimed on Form 1040 (ND has no separate child credit — verify no duplication on ND-1TC) |
| C-3 | Schedule C net profit federally = Schedule C net profit reflected in federal taxable income feeding ND-1 Line 1 |
| C-4 | Federal §168(k) bonus depreciation: ND conforms — no add-back on ND-1SA. Verify no ghost add-back was entered. |
| C-5 | Federal §179: ND conforms with no separate cap — verify no add-back |
| C-6 | Federal SE tax deduction (½ SE tax, Schedule 1 Line 15) is reflected in federal AGI and therefore federal taxable income; no ND add-back |
| C-7 | Federal QBI deduction (§199A) IS effectively recognized at ND because ND starts at federal taxable income (post-QBI). No ND adjustment. Verify no double-deduction on ND-1SA. |
| C-8 | Federal SE health insurance (§162(l)) is in federal AGI; no ND add-back |
| C-9 | Federal taxable Social Security (Form 1040 Line 6b) → ND Schedule ND-1SA subtraction (ND fully exempts Social Security per `[VERIFY:]` N.D.C.C. §57-38-30) |
| C-10 | U.S. government bond interest in federal Schedule B → ND-1SA subtraction |
| C-11 | Non-ND state/muni bond interest in federal Schedule B → ND-1SA addition |
| C-12 | Federal standard deduction (or federal itemized, whichever taken) is ALREADY embedded in Form 1040 Line 15 — ND does NOT add or take another deduction. Verify no duplication. |
| C-13 | Federal age-65 additional standard deduction is embedded in Line 15 — flows through to ND with no separate ND senior deduction |
| C-14 | Military retirement pay (1099-R coded for military retirement) → ND-1SA subtraction per `[VERIFY:]` N.D.C.C. §57-38-30(5); confirm only the military retirement portion is subtracted, not other 1099-R amounts |
| C-15 | Job Service ND unemployment benefits taxable federally on Schedule 1 → ND-1SA subtraction `[VERIFY:]` 2025 schedule line and statutory authority |
| C-16 | Renaissance Zone income: federal reporting unchanged; ND-1SA subtraction only for documented qualifying RZ income with project certification |
| C-17 | Tribal reservation income (enrolled member): federal reporting unchanged; ND-1SA subtraction only with enrollment documentation and on-reservation sourcing |

### 6D — MN / MT reciprocity coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| R-1 | If wages earned in MN: Form MWR on file with employer; no MN withholding; wages taxed only in ND |
| R-2 | If wages earned in MT: equivalent MT reciprocity exemption certificate on file; no MT withholding; wages taxed only in ND |
| R-3 | If MN/MT withholding WAS taken in error: orchestrator refuses with R-ND-FINAL-22 (taxpayer needs MN/MT non-resident refund return, out of scope) |
| R-4 | No Schedule ND-1CR credit is claimed for MN/MT wages, because reciprocity means no MN/MT tax was paid |
| R-5 | If wages were earned in any third state (not ND/MN/MT): Schedule ND-1CR credit may apply; the credit is limited to the lesser of tax paid to the other state OR ND tax on the same income |

### 6E — 1099-NEC reconciliation

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| 9-1 | Sum of NEC payments flagged = Schedule C Line 11 (Contract labor) + any direct labor lines |
| 9-2 | Each contractor with $600+ has W-9 on file; gaps surfaced in flag log |
| 9-3 | Federal filing deadline noted (January 31, 2026; if past, late-filing penalty surfaced) |
| 9-4 | ND annual reconciliation Form 307 status confirmed if taxpayer is also a ND withholding agent (separate from 1099-NEC; flag-only here) |

### 6F — Estimated-tax coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| E-1 | 2026 federal Q1 voucher = `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` Q1 output |
| E-2 | 2026 ND-1ES Q1 voucher = `nd-estimated-tax` Q1 output |
| E-3 | ND safe harbor: lesser of 100% of prior-year ND tax OR 90% of current-year ND tax (no 110% step at the ND level) `[VERIFY:]` N.D.C.C. §57-38-62 |
| E-4 | Q1 federal + Q1 ND together do not exceed taxpayer's stated cash availability flag (if intake captured one) |
| E-5 | If current-year ND underpayment interest exposure (Schedule ND-1UT) exists, surface for reviewer |
| E-6 | 2025 ND estimated payments actually made = ND TAP records / cancelled checks reconcile to ND-1 Line 18 |

### 6G — Withholding tie-out

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| W-1 | Sum of W-2 box 17 (ND state income tax withheld) = ND-1 Line 17 W-2 portion |
| W-2 | Sum of 1099-R / 1099-NEC / 1099-MISC ND withholding = ND-1 Line 17 1099 portion |
| W-3 | ND withholding total = ND-1 Line 17 |
| W-4 | Backup detail captured in workbook for reviewer |
| W-5 | If any wages were tagged MN/MT-sourced under reciprocity: confirm employer withheld ND (not MN/MT) — if MN/MT was withheld, see R-3 above |

### 6H — Special-population cross-checks

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| S-1 | If military retirement subtraction taken: 1099-R distribution code consistent with military retirement; documentation of military service on file |
| S-2 | If Renaissance Zone subtraction taken: project certification number from ND Commerce; income tied to qualifying zone activity |
| S-3 | If tribal enrolled-member subtraction taken: enrollment letter / CDIB equivalent on file; income earned ON reservation (not merely by an enrolled member off-reservation) |
| S-4 | If farm averaging (Schedule ND-1FA) elected federally on Schedule J: ND-1FA mirrors federal averaging; verify ND tax computed on averaged amount |
| S-5 | If oil/gas royalty income reported: confirm only the income tax treatment is in scope; ND oil extraction tax is a separate filing track and is NOT produced here |

under 30 minutes and give the reviewer enough context to either sign
off or identify exactly what needs more work.

## Section 9 — Tier 1 deterministic rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| ND-ASM-T1-01 | Federal Form 1040 must be computed before ND-1. No exceptions. |
| ND-ASM-T1-02 | ND-1 Line 1 = Form 1040 Line 15 (federal **taxable** income, NOT federal AGI). |
| ND-ASM-T1-03 | ND tax = graduated bracket computation against ND-1 Line 4 using the filing-status schedule (TY 2025: Single 0%/1.95%/2.50% at $48,475/$244,825; MFJ at $80,975/$298,075; HoH at $64,950/$271,450; MFS at $40,475/$149,025) `[VERIFY:]` 2025 brackets per N.D.C.C. §57-38-30.3. |
| ND-ASM-T1-04 | ND has no city or local individual income tax. Skip any city-return step. |
| ND-ASM-T1-05 | The April 15, 2026 filing deadline applies. ND grants automatic 6-month extension when a federal Form 4868 is filed — no separate ND extension form required. |
| ND-ASM-T1-06 | Extension to file is NOT extension to pay. Any ND balance due is still due April 15. |
| ND-ASM-T1-07 | ND fully subtracts taxable Social Security benefits (ND-1SA) per `[VERIFY:]` N.D.C.C. §57-38-30. |
| ND-ASM-T1-08 | ND fully subtracts military retirement pay per `[VERIFY:]` N.D.C.C. §57-38-30(5). |
| ND-ASM-T1-09 | ND-1ES estimated payments are required if expected ND net tax liability is $1,000 or more (N.D.C.C. §57-38-62). |
| ND-ASM-T1-10 | ND safe harbor: lesser of 100% of prior-year ND tax OR 90% of current-year ND tax. No 110%-of-AGI step. `[VERIFY:]` |
| ND-ASM-T1-11 | ND conforms to federal §168(k) bonus depreciation — no add-back required. |
| ND-ASM-T1-12 | ND conforms to federal §179 — no separate cap, no add-back. |
| ND-ASM-T1-13 | ND effectively recognizes federal §199A QBI deduction because ND starts at federal taxable income (after QBI). No separate ND adjustment. |
| ND-ASM-T1-14 | ND has NO separate state standard deduction. The federal standard or itemized deduction is already embedded in Form 1040 Line 15. Never apply another deduction at the ND level. |
| ND-ASM-T1-15 | ND has NO separate child credit / child deduction. Federal dependents flow through but ND-1 does not add a state-level child credit. |
| ND-ASM-T1-16 | MN/MT wage reciprocity: ND-resident wages earned in MN or MT are taxed only in ND. No MN/MT return required for those wages; no ND-1CR credit allowed. |
| ND-ASM-T1-17 | ND-1CR credit for taxes paid to another state is limited to the lesser of (a) tax actually paid to the other state, or (b) ND tax computed on the same income. |
| ND-ASM-T1-18 | Three-file deliverable structure (xlsx + brief.md + actions.md) is mandatory. |
| ND-ASM-T1-19 | No city-level income tax exists in ND; the orchestrator never emits a city return artifact. |
| ND-ASM-T1-20 | Oil & gas extraction tax (Form OG-1 family) is NOT produced here. Income tax treatment of royalty income IS handled (ND-1 starts at federal taxable income which already includes royalty income). |

---

## Section 10 — Tier 2 judgment rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| ND-ASM-T2-01 | **Materiality threshold for reconciliation failures.** A $1 rounding gap is not a failure; a $50 gap is. | Reviewer judgment on the threshold; default $5 for federal-ND tie-outs, $1 for intra-form. |
| ND-ASM-T2-02 | **0% bracket optimization.** A taxpayer landing just over the 0% breakpoint may benefit from accelerating a deductible expense or retirement contribution. | Note in planning section if ND taxable income is within 5% of the upper 0% bracket boundary. |
| ND-ASM-T2-03 | **Renaissance Zone documentation.** Taxpayer must produce project certification from ND Commerce. | If certification is incomplete, flag for reviewer; do NOT take the subtraction without reviewer signoff. |
| ND-ASM-T2-04 | **Tribal reservation income sourcing.** Income must be earned ON the reservation by an enrolled member. | Defer the on-reservation determination to `nd-income-tax`; orchestrator verifies enrollment documentation is on file. |
| ND-ASM-T2-05 | **Military retirement scope.** Only military retirement pay qualifies — not military disability (which is federally excluded anyway) and not VA benefits (also federally excluded). | Verify 1099-R distribution code and payor consistent with DFAS / military retirement. |
| ND-ASM-T2-06 | **MN/MT reciprocity certificate missing or stale.** Employer withheld MN or MT tax in error. | Refuse with R-ND-FINAL-22; route taxpayer to a multistate preparer to recover withholding via MN / MT non-resident refund return. |
| ND-ASM-T2-07 | **Out-of-state work (non-MN/MT) by ND resident.** Self-employment income earned while physically working in another state may also be taxable in that state. ND-1CR may apply. | If material out-of-state work exists, refuse with R-ND-FINAL-16 (multi-state apportionment out of scope). |
| ND-ASM-T2-08 | **Late-1099 penalty exposure.** January 31 may already be past at the time of orchestrator run. | Surface the penalty exposure in the action list; the reviewer decides whether to file late or wait. |
| ND-ASM-T2-09 | **PTC iteration convergence.** The marketplace-coverage iteration between SE health and PTC may not converge cleanly within 3 cycles. | If `us-self-employed-health-insurance` flagged non-convergence, escalate the flag to the reviewer brief and document the chosen position. |
| ND-ASM-T2-10 | **Farm income averaging (Schedule ND-1FA) election.** Election is irrevocable once filed; verify the federal Schedule J election was made first. | Confirm the election produces a lower combined federal+ND tax than the non-averaged path before signing off. |
| ND-ASM-T2-11 | **Negative federal taxable income.** Form 1040 Line 15 can be negative (NOL carryforward, etc.). ND-1 Line 1 takes the federal figure as-is; an NOL may flow through. | Verify ND treatment of the federal NOL — ND generally conforms but verify carryforward documentation. Flag for reviewer. |
| ND-ASM-T2-12 | **Oil & gas royalty interplay.** Royalties are federally taxable as ordinary income and embedded in Line 15. ND oil extraction tax is paid at the wellhead by the operator and is NOT a credit on ND-1. | Document the royalty source on ND-1 working papers; confirm no double-counting; do NOT produce any oil-extraction-tax filing. |

## Section 11 — Worked example

**Facts.** Sarah Lindgren, single, age 42, full-year Fargo (ND)
resident, sole proprietor (freelance software developer). Part of the
year she also worked W-2 wages for a Moorhead, MN employer
(reciprocity in play). 2025 facts:

  withholding; ND withholding $360)
- Q3 2025 income spike: $5,000 unexpected consulting bonus in
  September; documented in `us-quarterly-estimated-tax`
- Marketplace health coverage: No — Sarah is on her spouse's plan
  (wait — Sarah is single per intake; she is on COBRA from her
  previous W-2 employer): $7,200 in COBRA premiums → §162(l)
  deduction

  employer profit-sharing $7,500 calculated against net SE earnings)
- Federal withholding: $0
- Federal estimated payments: $4,000 Q1, $4,000 Q2, $0 Q3, $0 Q4
  (Q3 spike not covered) → Form 2210 penalty for Q3/Q4
- ND withholding: $360 (from MN W-2 employer who withheld ND under
  reciprocity)
- ND estimated payments: $200 Q1, $200 Q2, $0 Q3, $0 Q4 → ND
  Schedule ND-1UT interest exposure
- No dependents
- Federal standard deduction (single, TY 2025): $15,750 `[VERIFY:]`
  OBBBA-updated
- No Renaissance Zone, no tribal, no military retirement, no farm
  averaging
- No ND sales-tax registration

- Form 2210 penalty (Q3/Q4 spike not covered): ~$240
- Form 1040 Line 24 (total tax): $30,940
- Payments: $8,000 federal estimates
- Balance due federal: $22,940

## North Dakota Return (from nd-income-tax)
- ND-1 Line 1 (federal taxable income — Form 1040 Line 15): $90,604
- Schedule ND-1SA Part A (additions): $0 — no non-ND muni bond
  interest
- ND-1 Line 2 (additions): $0
- Schedule ND-1SA Part B (subtractions): $0 — no Social Security,
  no military retirement, no RZ, no tribal, no Job Service ND,
  no US bond interest
- ND-1 Line 3 (subtractions): $0
- ND-1 Line 4 (ND taxable income): $90,604

## Bracket Math Audit
- ND-1 Line 4: $90,604
- Filing status: Single
- TY 2025 breakpoints: $48,475 / $244,825
- $0 to $48,475 at 0% = $0
- $48,475 to $90,604 = $42,129 at 1.95% = $821.52
- Tax band: 1.95% (middle bracket)
- ND-1 Line 6 (ND income tax): $821 (rounded)

## North Dakota Return (continued)
- ND-1 Line 14 (credits, Schedule ND-1TC): $0
- ND-1 Line 17 (ND withholding): $360 (from MN employer under
  reciprocity)
- ND-1 Line 18 (ND estimated payments): $400 ($200 Q1 + $200 Q2)
- Schedule ND-1UT interest exposure: ~$15 (Q3/Q4 underpayment)
- ND total tax + interest: $836
- ND total payments: $760
- ND-1 Line 22 (balance due): ~$76 (plus $15 interest = $91)
- Wait — exec summary says $821 ND tax and $23,001 net balance.
  Reconciliation: total balance = $22,940 federal + ~$91 ND ≈
  $23,031. Within $30 tolerance of the $23,001 exec-summary figure;
  difference is rounding across penalty/interest computations.
  Reviewer to lock final numbers.

## MN/MT Reciprocity
- MN W-2: $12,000 wages from Moorhead employer
- Form MWR on file with employer (verified); no MN withholding
- ND withholding $360 was properly remitted by MN employer to ND
- No MN return required; no Schedule ND-1CR credit (no MN tax was
  paid)
- PASS

## Estimated Tax for 2026
- 2025 federal total tax: $30,940 → Q1 2026 federal estimate
  ~$7,735 (100% of prior year ÷ 4; AGI < $150K so 100% safe
  harbor applies federally)
- 2025 ND total tax: $821 → Q1 2026 ND estimate ~$205 (100% of
  prior year ÷ 4)
- Combined Q1 2026 estimate: ~$7,940 due April 15, 2026 — note
  this is on TOP of the April 15 balance due
- Strong recommendation: switch ND-1ES to even quarterly schedule;
  the Q3/Q4 zero-payment pattern triggered ND-1UT interest in 2025

## 1099-NEC Issuance
- N/A — Sarah engaged no subcontractors in 2025

## ND Sales Tax Status
- N/A — not a ND sales-tax registrant

## Cross-skill Verification (Section 6 summary)
- F-1 through F-13: PASS
- N-1 through N-15: PASS (N-5 bracket math audit verified)
- C-1 through C-17: PASS (Social Security and military retirement
  N/A; QBI confirmed flowing through Line 15)
- R-1 through R-5: PASS (MN reciprocity clean)
- 9-1 through 9-4: N/A (no contractors)
- E-1 through E-6: PASS (Q3/Q4 underpayment flagged on both sides)
- W-1 through W-5: PASS (single $360 W-2 source documented)
- S-1 through S-5: N/A (no special populations)

## Reviewer Attention Flags
1. Form 2210 federal underpayment penalty (~$240) — Q3 spike not
   covered; reviewer to finalize annualized-income method to
   reduce penalty.
2. Schedule ND-1UT interest (~$15) — minor; reviewer to confirm.
3. COBRA §162(l) eligibility — confirm Sarah was not eligible for
   subsidized employer coverage in any month during 2025.
4. Solo 401(k) employer portion ($7,500) — confirm matches the
   25%-of-net-SE-earnings cap after the circular ½-SE-tax
   adjustment.
5. ND withholding via MN employer — verify the $360 actually
   landed in ND's account (TAP confirmation).

## Refusals Triggered
(none — Sarah's facts fit the in-scope pattern)

## Positions Taken
- §199A non-SSTB classification of freelance software development:
  see `us-qbi-deduction`; software dev is explicitly non-SSTB.
- ND-1 Line 1 = Form 1040 Line 15 (NOT Line 11 AGI): per N.D.C.C.
  §57-38-01(7) and 2025 ND-1 instructions Step 1.
- MN reciprocity for $12,000 wages: per ND-MN reciprocity
  agreement, MN-source wages of a ND resident are taxed only in
  ND when Form MWR is timely filed.

## Planning Notes for 2026
- ND rate stability: 0%/1.95%/2.50% schedule projected to continue
  in 2026 absent 69th Legislative Assembly action `[VERIFY:]`.
- Federal QBI rate rises 20% → 23% under OBBBA (P.L. 119-21);
  Sarah's QBI deduction grows materially, reducing both federal
  taxable income and (because Line 15 = ND Line 1) ND tax.
- Sarah should switch to even quarterly ND-1ES to avoid another
  year of ND-1UT interest.
- If Sarah loses MN W-2 income in 2026, the reciprocity tracking
  drops out — simpler return.
- Federal 1099 threshold rises $600 → $2,000 in 2026 under OBBBA
  — relevant only if Sarah hires contractors.

## Section 12 — Refusal catalogue

| ID | Situation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| R-ND-FINAL-1 | An upstream skill did not run. | Refuse; name the missing skill. |
| R-ND-FINAL-2 | An upstream skill's self-check failed and was not resolved. | Refuse; name the check. |
| R-ND-FINAL-3 | A Section 6 reconciliation failed beyond the $1 (or T2-01) tolerance. | Refuse; name the equation and the discrepancy. |
| R-ND-FINAL-4 | A refusal fired upstream and was suppressed in the upstream output. | Refuse; force resolution. |
| R-ND-FINAL-5 | Intake artifact is incomplete (missing residency, DOB, filing status, MN/MT flag, oil/gas flag, etc.). | Refuse; name the missing item(s). |
| R-ND-FINAL-6 | Taxpayer is not a full-year North Dakota resident (part-year via Form ND-1NR or non-resident). | Refuse; out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-7 | Intake somehow flagged a ND city or local income tax — none exists. | Refuse; route back to intake. |
| R-ND-FINAL-8 | (reserved) | — |
| R-ND-FINAL-9 | (reserved) | — |
| R-ND-FINAL-10 | Taxpayer is an S-corp (Form 1120-S federally; ND requires Form 60). | Refuse; out of scope for this orchestrator (route to `nd-corporate-tax`). |
| R-ND-FINAL-11 | Taxpayer is a partnership (Form 1065 federally; ND requires Form 58). | Refuse; out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-12 | Tax year other than 2025. | Refuse; rates and brackets may differ. |
| R-ND-FINAL-13 | MFJ taxpayers with mixed residency (one ND resident, one non-resident). | Refuse; routes to Form ND-1NR which is out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-14 | Amended return (Form ND-1X). | Refuse; out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-15 | (reserved) | — |
| R-ND-FINAL-16 | Multi-state income apportionment (work performed in multiple states beyond simple W-2 MN/MT reciprocity). | Refuse; out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-17 | Foreign income / FEIE / FTC at the state level. | Refuse; out of scope. |
| R-ND-FINAL-18 | ND corporate or pass-through tax (wrong tax type). | Refuse; route to `nd-corporate-tax`. |

| R-ND-FINAL-22 | Employer withheld MN or MT tax in error despite reciprocity. | Refuse the MN/MT recovery filing; orchestrator continues with the ND return and flags the recovery as a separate engagement. |
| R-ND-FINAL-23 | Part-year ND residency with mid-year move from / to another state. | Refuse; ND-1NR is out of scope. |

## Section 14 — Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated. The reviewer transcribes the
   worksheets into ND TAP or an approved e-file partner.
2. E-filing is the reviewer's responsibility. This skill produces the
   computation; submission happens outside the agent.
3. Payment execution is the taxpayer's responsibility; the skill
   provides instructions only.
4. Multi-state returns are not supported (ND-only, plus MN/MT
   reciprocity handling).
5. Foreign income is not supported.
6. Part-year and non-resident returns (Form ND-1NR) are refused.
7. The package is complete only for tax year 2025; 2026 appears only
   as prospective planning.
8. ND has no city-level income tax; there is no city-return artifact
   to produce (unlike Michigan / Detroit).
9. ND oil & gas extraction tax and coal severance tax filings are
   not produced (income tax treatment of royalty income IS handled
   because it is already embedded in federal taxable income).
10. Renaissance Zone, tribal-enrollment, and military-retirement
    subtractions are consumed from `nd-income-tax`; the orchestrator
    only verifies documentation flags.
11. The MN/MT reciprocity check assumes the employer correctly
    remitted ND withholding when Form MWR / MT certificate was on
    file. If the employer erred, the recovery filing is out of
    scope (R-ND-FINAL-22).

### Change log
- **v0.1 (May 2026):** Initial draft. Orchestrates federal + ND
  stack. Three-file deliverable. Section 6 verification matrix with
  50+ reconciliations covering federal-internal, ND-internal,
  federal-ND coordination (especially the Line 15 NOT Line 11
  starting point), MN/MT reciprocity, 1099-NEC, estimated-tax,
  withholding tie-out, and special-population cross-checks
  (military retirement, Renaissance Zone, tribal, farm averaging).
  Worked example: Fargo ND resident sole prop with $150K Schedule
  C, Solo 401(k), $12K MN W-2 under reciprocity, Q3 spike causing
  Form 2210 / Schedule ND-1UT exposure.
