| Voluntary pension fund | Up to 1,000,000/month | If contributing to qualified fund |

### Taxable income formula

```
Taxable Income = Gross Income
                 − Compulsory insurance (BHXH + BHYT + BHTN)
                 − Personal deduction (15,500,000/month)
                 − Dependent deductions (6,200,000 × number of registered dependents/month)
