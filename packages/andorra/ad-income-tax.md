### IRPF Rate Brackets -- General Tax Base (Base General) 2025

**IRPF Rate Brackets -- General Tax Base (Base General) 2025**  _(e-tramits.ad; invicoandorra.com; andorra-solutions.com)_

| Annual Taxable Income (EUR) | Nominal Rate | Bonificació | Net Tax on Band | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 24,000 | 0% | n/a | EUR 0 | EUR 0 |
| 24,001 -- 40,000 | 10% | Up to EUR 800 | EUR 800 on full EUR 16,000 band | EUR 800 |
| Above 40,000 | 10% | None | 10% × excess | EUR 800 + 10% × (income − 40,000) |

Covers employment income, self-employment/business income, rental income.
Source: e-tramits.ad; invicoandorra.com; andorra-solutions.com

**Mechanism for the 5% effective band (24,001–40,000):** The law imposes a 10% rate but grants a bonificació (bonus rebate) of up to EUR 800 for income in this band. EUR 16,000 × 10% = EUR 1,600 gross tax; EUR 1,600 − EUR 800 = EUR 800 net tax → effective rate ~5% on the band. (invicoandorra.com; andorra-solutions.com)

**Key point:** There is no separate personal allowance — the EUR 24,000 zero-rate band IS the personal allowance.

### IRPF Rate -- Savings Tax Base (Base de l'Estalvi) 2025

**IRPF Rate -- Savings Tax Base (Base de l'Estalvi) 2025**  _(invicoandorra.com; andorrainc.com)_

| Annual Savings Income (EUR) | Rate |

| 0 -- 3,000 | 0% (exempt) |
| Above 3,000 | 10% on excess |

### CASS Contribution Rates (salaried employees and self-employed)

**CASS Contribution Rates**  _(remotepeople.com; en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caixa_Andorrana_de_Seguretat_Social)_

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Self-Employed (Compte Propi) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General Branch | 3.0% | 7.0% | 10.0% |
| Retirement Branch | 3.5% | 8.5% | 12.0% |
| **Total** | **6.5%** | **15.5%** | **22.0%** |

Employer handles full remittance of both employee and employer shares monthly.

### CASS Self-Employed Monthly Contribution Brackets (2025)

**CASS Self-Employed Monthly Contribution Brackets (2025)**  _(cass.ad/cotitzacions-del-treballadors-per-compte-propi; elysiumconsultingfirm.com)_

| % of Base | Monthly Base (EUR) | Monthly Quota (EUR) | Applicable Bracket |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 25% | 668.13 | 146.99 | Net income < EUR 6,000 + specific conditions |
| 50% | 1,525.33 | 335.57 | Net income EUR 6,000 -- 12,000 |
| 62.5% | 1,670.33 | 367.47 | Net income EUR 12,000 -- 18,000 |

| 137.5% | 3,674.72 | 808.44 | Net income > EUR 50,000 |

Reference base (100%): EUR 2,672.52/month — official CASS website (cass.ad, updated 30 January 2025).
Note: Secondary sources citing Decree 16/2025 (published 29 January 2025) use EUR 2,560.99 as the 100% base. The cass.ad official page should be used as the filing reference.

Monthly quota = monthly base × 22%. Verify: EUR 2,672.52 × 22% = EUR 587.95 ✓; EUR 3,340.65 × 22% = EUR 734.94 ✓; EUR 3,674.72 × 22% = EUR 808.44 ✓

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — do not compute IRPF without confirming ≥183-day presence or principal economic interests |
| Unknown spousal income | Do not apply the EUR 40,000 spousal threshold uplift |
| Unknown CASS bracket | Apply 100% base (EUR 587.95/month) — highest safe assumption for standard rate |
| Unknown IGI registration status | Assume not registered if turnover < EUR 40,000 |
| Unknown housing deduction basis | 0% — do not apply without mortgage/rental documentation |
| Unknown dependent status | 0 dependants — do not apply deductions without documentation |
| Unknown capital gains holding period | Apply highest applicable rate |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — full-year bank statement (CSV, PDF, or pasted text) plus confirmation of: (1) fiscal residency status (≥183 days in AD, or principal economic interests in AD), (2) employment or self-employment status, (3) family situation (single / married or de facto partner / dependent children or ascendants), (4) NRT (Número de Registre Tributari).

**Recommended** — all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, CASS contribution payment records, prior-year IRPF declaration, employer IRPF withholding certificate (if employed), mortgage or rental contract (if claiming housing deduction), tuition receipts (if claiming education deduction).

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account, asset register, CASS annual declaration, all documentation for deductions, employer withholding certificate showing total income and tax withheld.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This IRPF declaration was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the wholly-and-exclusively test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-AD-1** — Residency status unclear. "Andorran fiscal residency requires ≥183 days physical presence, or principal economic interests in Andorra, or primary family ties in Andorra. This skill cannot determine tax liability without confirming residence status. Please confirm before proceeding."  _(e-tramits.ad)_
- **R-AD-2** — Non-resident income (IRNR). "Non-resident Andorran source income is taxed under the IRNR regime at flat 10% (payer withholds). Scope of this skill is limited to fiscal residents. For IRNR analysis, use the dedicated IRNR section below or escalate to a licensed Andorran advisor."
- **R-AD-3** — Corporate / entity income. "This skill covers natural persons (IRPF) only. Andorran companies and branches file under the Impost de Societats (IS) at 10%. Escalate to an Andorran advisor."
- **R-AD-4** — Complex capital gains (real estate). "Real-estate capital gains require verification of purchase date, cost base, notarial fees, and reinvestment details. Out of scope for automated classification. Escalate to a licensed Andorran advisor."
- **R-AD-5** — Arrears / enforcement. "Client has outstanding IRPF or CASS arrears or is subject to DTF enforcement. Late payment surcharges of 10%–20% plus formal sanctions (EUR 500–EUR 20,000) may apply. Do not advise on quantum without advisor involvement. Escalate immediately."
- **R-AD-6** — IGI return requested. "This skill covers IRPF (direct tax) only. For IGI (indirect tax / VAT equivalent), use the andorra-igi skill."
- **R-AD-7** — Inheritance, gifts, wealth. "Andorra has no inheritance tax, gift tax, or wealth tax. These are out of scope. Simply note the absence and confirm no filing required."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Single Resident Autònom, Mid-Range Income

**Profile:** Single, no dependants, self-employed consultant, Andorran resident (≥183 days).
**Gross business revenue:** EUR 55,000
**Business expenses (deductible):** EUR 9,000
**CASS quota (100% bracket):** EUR 587.95/month × 12 = EUR 7,055.40/year
**General expenses deduction:** 3% × (EUR 55,000 − EUR 9,000 − EUR 7,055.40) = 3% × EUR 38,944.60 = EUR 1,168.34 → capped at **EUR 400**

**Computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Gross revenue | 55,000.00 |
| Less: business expenses | (9,000.00) |
| Less: CASS self-employed quota (deductible) | (7,055.40) |
| Sub-total | 38,944.60 |
| Less: general expenses deduction (capped) | (400.00) |
| IRPF general base (taxable) | 38,544.60 |
| Tax on EUR 0–24,000 at 0% | 0.00 |
| Tax on EUR 24,001–38,544.60 (band of EUR 14,544.60): 10% = EUR 1,454.46 minus bonificació EUR 800 (partial band) | 654.46 |
| **Total IRPF due** | **654.46** |

Bonificació note: The EUR 800 bonificació applies when income exceeds EUR 40,000 (using the full band). Here income is EUR 38,544.60 — within the EUR 24,001–40,000 band. The bonificació is proportionally available up to EUR 800. At full band occupancy: EUR 16,000 × 10% − EUR 800 = EUR 800 at EUR 40,000. At EUR 38,544.60, taxable in band = EUR 14,544.60; gross tax EUR 1,454.46; bonificació = EUR 800 (maximum); net tax = EUR 654.46.

### Example 2 -- Resident with Spouse (Zero Income Partner)

**Profile:** Married, spouse earns EUR 0, single earner. Gross employment income EUR 36,000.
**Employer withholds IRPF** (no provisional tax for employee).
**Spousal relief:** If spouse earns zero, the effective zero-rate band rises to EUR 40,000 (lavallassociats.com; andorra-solutions.com).

**Computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Gross employment income | 36,000.00 |
| Less: employee CASS (6.5%) | (2,340.00) |
| Less: general expenses deduction (3% × EUR 33,660 = EUR 1,009.80, capped) | (400.00) |
| IRPF general base | 33,260.00 |
| Applied threshold with spousal relief = EUR 40,000 | — |
| Income EUR 33,260 is below EUR 40,000 spousal threshold | 0.00 |
| **Total IRPF due** | **0.00** |

Without spousal relief: EUR 33,260 − EUR 24,000 = EUR 9,260 in 10% band; gross tax EUR 926 − EUR 800 bonificació = EUR 126 due. The spousal relief eliminates this entirely.

### Example 3 -- Savings Base (Foreign Dividends)

**Computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Foreign dividends received | 8,000.00 |
| Less: savings base exemption | (3,000.00) |
| Taxable savings base | 5,000.00 |
| IRPF at 10% | 500.00 |
| **Total savings base IRPF due** | **500.00** |

**Profile:** Resident, receives EUR 8,000 in foreign dividends, no other savings income.

Note: Andorran company dividends = EUR 0 IRPF (fully exempt). Only foreign dividends are on the savings base. (andorrainc.com)

### Example 4 -- New Autònom (Start-of-Activity CASS Reduction)

**Profile:** Single, first year of self-employment (newly registered, not previously registered for ≥36 months). Net income for year EUR 18,000. Eligible for 25% CASS base.

**CASS (first 12 months, 25% base, start-of-activity regime):**
25% base = EUR 668.13/month. Only general branch (10%): EUR 668.13 × 10% = EUR 66.81/month.
Annual CASS = EUR 66.81 × 12 = EUR 801.72.
(Note: no pension points accrued; limited health coverage — elysiumconsultingfirm.com)

**IRPF computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Gross revenue | 18,000.00 |
| Less: business expenses (assumed EUR 2,000) | (2,000.00) |
| Less: CASS paid | (801.72) |
| Sub-total | 15,198.28 |
| Less: general expenses deduction (3% capped at EUR 400) | (400.00) |
| IRPF general base | 14,798.28 |
| Tax on EUR 0–14,798.28 at 0% (below EUR 24,000 threshold) | 0.00 |
| **Total IRPF due** | **0.00** |

### Example 5 -- High-Income Autònom (125% CASS Bracket)

**Profile:** Single, no dependants. Net income EUR 48,000. CASS at 125% bracket (net income > EUR 40,000).

**CASS:** EUR 734.94/month × 12 = EUR 8,819.28/year

**IRPF computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Net business profit | 48,000.00 |
| Less: CASS quota | (8,819.28) |
| Less: general expenses deduction (3% × EUR 39,180.72 = EUR 1,175.42, capped at EUR 400) | (400.00) |
| IRPF general base | 38,780.72 |
| Tax on EUR 0–24,000 at 0% | 0.00 |
| Tax on EUR 24,001–38,780.72: band = EUR 14,780.72; gross 10% = EUR 1,478.07; minus bonificació EUR 800 | 678.07 |
| **Total IRPF due** | **678.07** |

### Example 6 -- Real-Estate Capital Gain (Held 3 Years, Resident)

**Profile:** Resident sells apartment purchased 3 years ago. Purchase price EUR 200,000; sale price EUR 250,000. Gain = EUR 50,000.

Holding period 2–10 years: rate is 10% (decreasing by 1% per year from year 2; at year 3 = approximately 9%, but confirm exact schedule with DTF [RESEARCH GAP — exact year-by-year rate step-down not fully confirmed from reviewed sources]).

Using 10% conservative:

**Computation**

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
| --- | --- |
| Sale price | 250,000.00 |
| Less: purchase price | (200,000.00) |
| Capital gain | 50,000.00 |
| IRPF at 10% (conservative; reviewer to confirm exact year-3 rate) | 5,000.00 |
| **Estimated IRPF on gain** | **5,000.00** |

Reinvestment exemption: if reinvesting in primary residence within 6 months → EUR 0 IRPF. Flag for reviewer.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Fiscal Residency Test

- **Fiscal residency test** — A natural person is an Andorran fiscal resident if any one of the following is satisfied: physically present in Andorra for more than 183 days in the calendar year (border data is used to verify), OR their principal centre of economic interests is in Andorra, OR their primary family ties are in Andorra. If residency is uncertain: STOP and apply Refusal R-AD-1.  _(Llei 5/2014 (IRPF); e-tramits.ad)_

- **Home office deduction rules** — Calculate proportion of home used for business: dedicated room(s) as percentage of total floor area. Apply that percentage to: rent or mortgage interest, electricity (FEDA), internet (Andorra Telecom), maintenance. Must be a dedicated workspace — a dual-use room (kitchen table, living room) does NOT qualify. Client must document the calculation and retain records. Conservative default: 0% deduction until reviewer confirms dedicated workspace arrangement. Flag for reviewer: Confirm room count, floor area basis, and that workspace is genuinely dedicated and used exclusively for business.  _(IRPF deductions framework (Llei 5/2014))_

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- **Motor vehicle business use rules** — Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible. Client must maintain a mileage log (business trips vs total mileage). Depreciation rate: [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Andorran depreciation rates for motor vehicles]. Conservative default: 0% business use until mileage log provided. Flag for reviewer: Confirm business percentage is documented with mileage log and is reasonable.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- **Phone/internet mixed use rules** — Business use portion only; client must provide reasonable estimate. Conservative default: 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Spousal Income Verification

- **Spousal income verification** — Spousal relief (EUR 40,000 threshold) requires spouse/de facto partner to have EUR 0 income. Do not apply without written confirmation. Flag for reviewer: Confirm spouse earns zero from all sources for the tax year.

### 6.5 Dependent Child / Ascendant Deductions

- **Dependent deduction conditions** — Each qualifying dependent: age <25 or >65, lives with taxpayer, earns <EUR 12,000/year. Additional EUR 1,000 (2025): child under 25, earns below SMI (EUR 1,447.33/month). Education EUR 300 (2025): enrolled in university — requires tuition documentation. Flag for reviewer: Confirm ages, cohabitation, income levels, and obtain enrollment documentation for education deduction.

### 6.6 Housing Deduction (2025 New Measure)

- **Housing deduction conditions** — 50% of mortgage principal + interest + acquisition costs; max EUR 5,000/year. Only for primary residence acquisition. Requires mortgage statements and purchase documentation. Flag for reviewer: Confirm property is primary residence, obtain all mortgage/acquisition documents, verify EUR 5,000 annual cap not exceeded.

### 6.7 Capital Gains Holding Period

- **Holding period measurement** — Holding period is measured from notarial deed date of acquisition to notarial deed date of sale. Notarial records are the authoritative source. Flag for reviewer: Obtain copies of both purchase and sale deeds to confirm exact holding period.

### 6.8 IGI / Income Interaction

- **IGI/income interaction rules** — If self-employed and IGI-registered: income for IRPF = net of IGI collected (exclude the 4.5% from revenue). If not IGI-registered (below EUR 40,000 threshold): no IGI collected, full invoice amount = IRPF income. Flag for reviewer: Confirm IGI registration status and that the correct net/gross basis is used.

### 6.9 Active Residency Financial Deposit (Self-Employed)

- **Active residency deposit rules** — Self-employed active residency requires a EUR 50,000 financial deposit with an Andorran bank. This deposit is non-refundable as a cash refund but remains invested (not a cost but a capital lockup). The deposit itself is NOT deductible for IRPF purposes. Flag for reviewer: Confirm client has active residency; note deposit is a balance sheet item, not a P&L expense.

### Test Suite

Input: Single, gross revenue EUR 20,000, expenses EUR 2,000, CASS at 50% bracket (EUR 335.57/month × 12 = EUR 4,026.84).
Expected: Net income = EUR 20,000 − EUR 2,000 − EUR 4,026.84 = EUR 13,973.16. Less general deduction (3% = EUR 419.19, capped EUR 400) = EUR 13,573.16. Below EUR 24,000 → IRPF EUR 0.

Input: Single, no dependants, gross revenue EUR 50,000, expenses EUR 10,000, CASS 100% bracket (EUR 587.95 × 12 = EUR 7,055.40).
Expected: Net = EUR 50,000 − EUR 10,000 − EUR 7,055.40 = EUR 32,944.60. Less EUR 400 deduction = EUR 32,544.60. Tax: EUR 0 on EUR 0–24,000; band EUR 24,001–32,544.60 = EUR 8,544.60 × 10% = EUR 854.46 minus bonificació EUR 800 = EUR 54.46. Total IRPF = EUR 54.46.

Input: Single, gross revenue EUR 75,000, expenses EUR 15,000, CASS 125% bracket (EUR 734.94 × 12 = EUR 8,819.28).
Expected: Net = EUR 75,000 − EUR 15,000 − EUR 8,819.28 = EUR 51,180.72. Less EUR 400 = EUR 50,780.72. Tax: EUR 0 on EUR 0–24,000; EUR 24,001–40,000 (EUR 16,000): EUR 1,600 − EUR 800 = EUR 800; EUR 40,001–50,780.72 (EUR 10,780.72) × 10% = EUR 1,078.07. Total IRPF = EUR 1,878.07.

Input: Married, spouse EUR 0 income. Taxpayer employment income EUR 38,000. Employee CASS: EUR 38,000 × 6.5% = EUR 2,470. Net = EUR 38,000 − EUR 2,470 = EUR 35,530. Less EUR 400 = EUR 35,130. Spousal relief raises threshold to EUR 40,000. EUR 35,130 < EUR 40,000 → IRPF EUR 0.

Input: Foreign dividends EUR 12,000, no other savings income.
Expected: Taxable savings base = EUR 12,000 − EUR 3,000 = EUR 9,000. IRPF at 10% = EUR 900.

Input: Dividend from Andorran SL EUR 5,000.
Expected: Fully exempt. IRPF EUR 0. Do not include in any base.

Input: Self-employed, net income EUR 45,000 → 125% bracket.
