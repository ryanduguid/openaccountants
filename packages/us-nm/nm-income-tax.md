| Single | $15,000 (federal amount — verify) |
| Married filing jointly | $30,000 (federal amount — verify) |
| Head of household | $22,500 (federal amount — verify) |

### Low-and-middle-income exemption

- **Low-and-middle-income exemption** — New Mexico offers a low-and-middle-income exemption of up to $2,500 per qualified exemption, based on adjusted gross income. All taxpayers (residents, part-year residents, nonresidents) may claim this exemption.

### Local income tax

- **Local income tax** — New Mexico does not permit local income taxes.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

New Mexico taxable income starts with **federal adjusted gross income (FAGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Start with federal AGI** → PIT-1
2. **Add NM additions** — items NM adds back
3. **Subtract NM subtractions** — items NM excludes
4. **Subtract NM exemptions** (low-and-middle-income exemption, blind/aged exemptions)
5. **Subtract standard or itemized deductions** (NM follows federal amounts)
6. **Result = NM taxable income**
7. **Apply the graduated rate schedule** → NM tax
8. **Apply credits and rebates** (Schedule PIT-CR) → final tax due or refund

### Key addition modifications

**Key addition modifications**

| Addition | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Lump-sum distributions | Certain lump-sum distributions not included in federal AGI |
| NM income not in federal AGI | Income taxable by NM but excluded from federal return |

### Key subtraction modifications

**Key subtraction modifications**

| Subtraction | Description |
| --- | --- |
| US government bond interest | Interest from US Treasury obligations |
| Social Security | NM does not tax Social Security benefits |
| Military retirement pay | Exempt for certain qualifying individuals |
| Age 65+ income exemption | Up to $8,000 for 65+ with AGI under $51,000 (single) or $36,667 (MFJ per spouse) |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income flow

- **Self-employment income flow** — Schedule C net profit flows into federal AGI, which is the starting point for NM. NM follows the federal self-employment tax deduction (deductible half of SE tax) through federal AGI.

### Estimated tax

- **Estimated tax threshold** — NM requires estimated tax payments if you expect to owe $1,000 or more after subtracting withholding and credits.

**Estimated tax installment due dates**

| Installment | Due date |
| --- | --- |
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form PIT-ES is used for estimated tax payments.

### Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) interaction

- **GRT interaction** — Self-employed taxpayers in NM are also subject to the Gross Receipts Tax (GRT), which is NM's equivalent of a sales/use tax but is imposed on the seller's gross receipts. Unlike a traditional sales tax, the GRT is imposed on the business (not the buyer), though it is commonly passed through to customers. - GRT applies to most services as well as goods (unlike most state sales taxes). - Rates vary by location (combined state + local: approximately 5.0% to 9.4375%). - Self-employed service providers must register for and collect/remit GRT. - GRT paid is deductible as a business expense on the federal Schedule C.

### Working Families Tax Credit (NM EIC)

- **NM Working Families Tax Credit** — NM offers a refundable earned income credit equal to 25% of the federal Earned Income Credit (EIC) for TY 2025. This is particularly valuable for lower-income self-employed taxpayers.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

- **NM-T1-01** — NM taxable income = federal AGI ± NM modifications − exemptions − deductions  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-2)_
- **NM-T1-02** — Tax computed using 6-bracket schedule: 1.5%–5.9% (TY 2025)  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-7; HB 252)_
- **NM-T1-03** — Starting point is federal AGI (Form 1040, Line 11)  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-2)_
- **NM-T1-04** — Social Security benefits fully exempt  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-2(S))_
- **NM-T1-05** — Low-and-middle-income exemption: up to $2,500 per qualified exemption  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-5.6)_
- **NM-T1-06** — NM Working Families Tax Credit = 25% of federal EIC (refundable)  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-18.16)_
- **NM-T1-07** — Estimated tax required if expected liability ≥ $1,000  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-12.2)_
- **NM-T1-08** — NM follows federal standard deduction amounts  _(N.M. Stat. Ann. §7-2-2)_

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

- **NM-T2-01** — Multi-state income: Taxpayer has income from another state  _(NM taxes worldwide income of residents. Credit for taxes paid to other states available on Schedule PIT-CR.)_
- **NM-T2-02** — GRT vs. income tax interaction  _(GRT is a separate tax on gross receipts, not a credit against income tax. GRT paid is deductible as a business expense on federal Schedule C, which flows through to NM.)_
- **NM-T2-03** — Technology jobs tax credit  _(NM offers credits for qualifying technology businesses. Requires certification.)_
- **NM-T2-04** — Angel investment credit  _(NM allows credits for qualified investments in NM small businesses. Requires approval from NM Economic Development Department.)_
- **NM-T2-05** — Federal IRC conformity  _(NM's conformity with the IRC should be verified for recent federal changes. NM generally has rolling conformity but may decouple from specific provisions.)_
- **NM-T2-06** — Community property  _(New Mexico IS a community property state. MFS returns require community property income allocation.)_
