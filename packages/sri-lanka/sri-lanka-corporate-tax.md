### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Sector/rate unclear | Apply 30% standard |
| Forex-remittance concession (15%) claimed | Apply 30% until remittance-through-a-bank evidence confirmed |
| Betting/gaming or liquor/tobacco activity | Apply 45% (flat) unless it is export (then 30%) |
| SME / sector concession asserted | Do NOT apply — not confirmed in this skill; VERIFY against current IRA/IRD |

---

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — audited or draft financial statements (P&L, balance sheet), prior-year return, taxable-income computation, confirmation of (i) sector (standard / betting-gaming / liquor-tobacco / export), (ii) any foreign-currency-remitted income claiming the 15% rate, (iii) WHT/AIT credits.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-LK-CT-1 — Banking, insurance, and sector special regimes.** These carry separate computation rules. Out of scope — escalate.

**R-LK-CT-2 — SME / concessionary sector rates not in this skill.** Any SME or sector-specific concessionary rate must be VERIFIED against the current IRA and IRD guidance — this skill asserts only the 30% standard, 15% remitted-forex, and 45% betting/liquor/tobacco rates.

**R-LK-CT-3 — Group taxation, transfer pricing, reorganisations.** Out of scope — escalate.

**R-LK-CT-4 — Cross-skill scope.** Personal tax → `sri-lanka-income-tax`; WHT/AIT → `sri-lanka-withholding-tax`; SSCL → `sri-lanka-sscl`; VAT → `sri-lanka-vat`.

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rates

### 3.1 Standard rate — 30%

The standard corporate income tax rate is **30%** of taxable income, in force since **1 April 2023** (it was 24% from 1 January 2020, and 28% before that). Apply to taxable income computed under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017.

```
Standard CIT = 30% × Taxable income
```

### 3.2 Concessionary rate — 15% (remitted foreign currency)

A **15%** concessionary rate applies to qualifying **foreign-currency-source income and services remitted to Sri Lanka through a bank**. Require evidence of the foreign-currency source and the banking-channel remittance before applying.

### 3.3 Higher rate — 45% (betting/gaming, liquor, tobacco)

A flat **45%** rate applies to income from a business consisting of:
- betting and gaming; or
- manufacture and sale, or import and sale, of any liquor or tobacco product.

Raised from 40% effective **1 April 2025** (Act No. 02 of 2025). The **export** of liquor or tobacco products is taxed at the **30%** normal rate, not 45%. The same 45% flat rate applies to **individuals** carrying on such business income.

---

## Section 4 — Tier 2

- **Capital gains.** Gains on the realisation of investment assets are taxed at a flat **10%** (resident and non-resident). Company-specific characterisation (business asset vs investment asset) — VERIFY with the practitioner.
- **Losses, depreciation, allowances.** Computed under the IRA (Second/Fourth Schedules) — detailed loss carry-forward and capital-allowance rules are NOT asserted here; VERIFY against the IRA.
- **SSCL interaction.** SSCL (2.5% on liable turnover) is a separate levy — see `sri-lanka-sscl`.

---

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### 5.1 Standard company
Taxable income LKR 50,000,000 → CIT = 30% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 15,000,000**.

### 5.2 Liquor manufacturer (domestic)
Taxable income LKR 50,000,000 from domestic liquor manufacture/sale → CIT = 45% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 22,500,000**. (If the same income were from **export** of the product, the rate would be 30%.)

### 5.3 IT services exporter, forex remitted through a bank
Qualifying remitted foreign-currency services income LKR 50,000,000 → CIT = 15% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 7,500,000**, provided the banking-channel remittance is evidenced.

---

## Section 6 — Filing

- **Year of assessment:** 1 April – 31 March.
- **Statement of Estimated Tax Payable (SET):** under IRA s.91; YA 2025/26 due **15 August 2025**.
- **Annual return + payment / quarterly instalment dates:** VERIFY against the current IRD calendar (not asserted here).

---

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Item | Default |
|---|---|
| Rate uncertain | 30% standard |
| 15% forex concession | Apply only with banking-remittance evidence |
| Betting/gaming/liquor/tobacco | 45% (flat) unless export (30%) |
| SME / other concession | Not applied — VERIFY |
| Any figure flagged VERIFY | Flag for reviewer; do not finalise |

## Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the 24% or 28% historical rate to YA 2025/26 — the standard rate is 30%.
- NEVER apply the 15% concession without banking-channel forex-remittance evidence.
- NEVER use the old 40% rate for betting/gaming/liquor/tobacco for periods from 1 April 2025 — it is 45%.
- NEVER assert an SME/sector concession this skill flags as VERIFY.
- NEVER file or instruct filing — produce a working paper for practitioner review.
