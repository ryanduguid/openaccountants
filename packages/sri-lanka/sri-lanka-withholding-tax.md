## Section 1 — Quick reference (rate table, effective 1 April 2025)

| Payment type | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Interest or discount** | **10%** | Raised from 5% effective 1 April 2025 (IRD Circulars SEC/2025/E/02 & E/03). Resident individuals may self-declare for relief where assessable income does not exceed the LKR 1,800,000 relief |
| **Dividends** | **15%** | Resident companies distributing dividends |
| **Resident rent** | **10%** | Where rent exceeds LKR 100,000 per calendar month |
| **Resident service fees** | **5%** | Independent professional service fees, aggregate over LKR 100,000/month |
| **Royalties** | **14%** | |
| **Non-resident rent / service fees / insurance premiums** | **14%** | Single non-resident bucket |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country / authority | Sri Lanka — Inland Revenue Department (IRD) |
| Currency | LKR |
| Statute | Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, as amended by Act No. 02 of 2025 (eff. 1 April 2025) |
| Year of assessment | 1 April – 31 March |
| Mechanism | AIT (Advance Income Tax) deducted at source by the payer; creditable against the recipient's income tax |
| Validated by | Pending — Sri Lankan CA / IRD-registered practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Payment type unclear | Apply the rate for the most specific matching category; if still unclear, flag |
| Resident vs non-resident recipient unconfirmed | Treat as non-resident (14%) and flag |
| Rent/service-fee monthly threshold borderline | Apply WHT if aggregate exceeds LKR 100,000/month |
| Self-declaration for interest relief claimed | Require the recipient's declaration on file; else withhold 10% |

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

Payer identity & TIN; recipient legal name, TIN, and **residency status**; nature of payment (interest, dividend, rent, service fee, royalty); gross amount and period; any self-declaration for relief (interest); for non-residents, treaty residence certificate where treaty relief is claimed.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-LK-WHT-1 — APIT / PAYE on employment.** Employment withholding is APIT, not this AIT regime — use `sri-lanka-income-tax` / `sri-lanka-payroll`.

**R-LK-WHT-2 — Treaty rate claim without a residence certificate.** Apply the statutory non-resident rate; do not apply a treaty cap without the certificate. Escalate treaty analysis.

**R-LK-WHT-3 — Sector special regimes (banking, insurance, capital markets).** Out of scope — escalate.

**R-LK-WHT-4 — VAT / SSCL withholding.** Different regimes — use `sri-lanka-vat` / `sri-lanka-sscl`.

---

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rules

### 3.1 Interest or discount — 10%
Deduct **10%** on interest or discount paid (raised from 5% effective 1 April 2025). A **resident individual** whose assessable income does not exceed the LKR 1,800,000 personal relief may **self-declare** to the payer to reduce/avoid the deduction — require the declaration on file. **Source:** IRD tax chart YA 2025/26; PN/IT/2025-01; IRD Circulars SEC/2025/E/02 and SEC/2025/E/03.

### 3.2 Dividends — 15%
Deduct **15%** on dividends.

### 3.3 Resident rent — 10%
Deduct **10%** on rent paid to a resident where the rent **exceeds LKR 100,000 per calendar month**.

### 3.4 Resident service fees — 5%
Deduct **5%** on service fees paid to resident independent professionals where the **aggregate exceeds LKR 100,000 per month**.

### 3.5 Royalties — 14%
Deduct **14%** on royalties.

### 3.6 Non-residents — 14%
Deduct **14%** on non-resident rent, non-resident service fees, and insurance premiums (subject to any applicable double-tax treaty cap, which requires a residence certificate).

---

## Section 4 — Tier 2

- **Credit / final tax.** AIT deducted is generally creditable against the recipient's income tax. Whether a given deduction is creditable vs final depends on the recipient and payment type — VERIFY per the IRA for each stream.
- **Self-declaration mechanics (interest).** The relief self-declaration is recipient-specific and time-bound; the payer must hold it before applying a reduced/zero deduction.
- **Treaty relief.** Reduced rates for non-residents require a tax-residence certificate and beneficial-ownership confirmation — escalate.

---

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### 5.1 Interest paid to a resident company
Bank pays LKR 1,000,000 interest → AIT = 10% × 1,000,000 = **LKR 100,000** withheld and remitted; recipient credits it.

### 5.2 Resident rent above threshold
Company pays LKR 150,000/month rent to a resident landlord (> LKR 100,000) → AIT = 10% × 150,000 = **LKR 15,000/month**.

### 5.3 Service fee to a non-resident consultant
Payment LKR 2,000,000 to a non-resident for services → AIT = 14% × 2,000,000 = **LKR 280,000** (subject to any treaty cap with a residence certificate).

---

## Section 6 — Filing and payment

- AIT is deducted at the time of payment and remitted to the IRD, with a withholding certificate issued to the recipient.
- **Remittance and statement due dates — VERIFY** against the current IRD WHT/AIT schedule (not asserted here).

---

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Situation | Default |
|---|---|
| Residency unconfirmed | Non-resident 14%; flag |
| Interest self-declaration not on file | Withhold 10% |
| Treaty cap claimed without certificate | Apply statutory rate |
| Payment-type ambiguity | Most specific category; flag |
| Any figure flagged VERIFY | Flag for reviewer |

## Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the old 5% interest rate for periods from 1 April 2025 — it is 10%.
- NEVER apply a treaty-reduced non-resident rate without a tax-residence certificate.
- NEVER skip WHT on resident rent over LKR 100,000/month or resident professional service fees over LKR 100,000/month aggregate.
- NEVER assert remittance/statement dates this skill flags as VERIFY.
- NEVER file or instruct filing — produce a working paper for practitioner review.
