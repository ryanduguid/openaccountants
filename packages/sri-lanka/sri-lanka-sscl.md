  ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Sri Lanka Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL) work. Use whenever asked about SSCL on turnover for importers, manufacturers, service providers, wholesalers/retailers, or financial-service businesses in Sri Lanka. Trigger on phrases like "Sri Lanka SSCL", "Social Security Contribution Levy", "2.5% turnover levy Sri Lanka", "liable turnover Sri Lanka", or "SSCL registration Sri Lanka". Covers the SSCL at 2.5% on liable turnover, the activity-dependent liable-turnover fraction, and its in-force status (most recently amended by the SSCL Amendment Act No. 24 of 2025). Out of scope — income tax, corporate tax, VAT, and withholding tax (separate skills).

## Section 1 — Quick reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country / authority | Sri Lanka — Inland Revenue Department (IRD) |
| Tax | Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL) — a turnover-based levy, separate from VAT and income tax |
| Currency | LKR |
| **Rate** | **2.5% on liable turnover** |
| Liable turnover | An **activity-dependent fraction (25%–100%) of gross turnover** — NOT gross turnover itself |
| Status | **In force** (most recently amended by the SSCL Amendment Act No. 24 of 2025) |
| Principal statute | Social Security Contribution Levy Act (2022), as amended — VERIFY the exact principal-Act number/year |
| Registration threshold | **Not asserted — VERIFY** (a quarterly liable-turnover threshold applies; confirm current LKR figure with the IRD) |
| Validated by | Pending — Sri Lankan CA / IRD-registered practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Liable-turnover fraction for the activity unclear | Apply the **higher** fraction (up to 100%) and flag |
| Registration obligation borderline (threshold) | Treat as registrable and flag — VERIFY threshold |
| Whether SSCL applies to a supply | Apply 2.5% on the liable fraction and flag for reviewer |

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs
Business activity classification (importer / manufacturer / service provider / wholesaler-retailer / financial services — drives the liable-turnover fraction); gross turnover for the period; SSCL registration status; any exemptions claimed.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-LK-SSCL-1 — Liable-turnover fraction tables.** The exact 25%–100% fraction per activity class is set by the SSCL Act/schedules and changes by amendment — this skill states the principle but does NOT assert the per-activity fraction table. VERIFY against the current SSCL Act and IRD guidance; escalate.

**R-LK-SSCL-2 — Registration threshold.** The quarterly liable-turnover registration threshold is NOT asserted here — VERIFY the current LKR figure with the IRD.

**R-LK-SSCL-3 — Exemptions / sector treatment.** Exempt supplies and sector-specific treatment are schedule-driven — escalate.

**R-LK-SSCL-4 — Cross-skill.** Income tax / corporate / VAT / WHT → the respective Sri Lanka skills.

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rules

### 3.1 Rate and base
SSCL is charged at **2.5%** on **liable turnover**. Liable turnover is an **activity-dependent fraction (25%–100%) of gross turnover** — i.e. for many activities only a portion of gross turnover is subject to the levy. Applying 2.5% directly to gross turnover for every activity **over-states** the levy for activities with a sub-100% fraction.

```
SSCL = 2.5% × (liable-turnover fraction × gross turnover)
```

The liable-turnover fraction depends on the activity class (importer, manufacturer, service provider, wholesaler/retailer, financial services). **The per-activity fraction is not asserted in this skill — VERIFY** against the current SSCL Act and IRD schedule.

### 3.2 Status
SSCL is **in force** for YA 2025/26, most recently amended by the **SSCL Amendment Act No. 24 of 2025**. (Note: the existing VAT skill flags SSCL status as volatile — this skill confirms it is currently in force, but the practitioner should re-confirm the in-force status and any rate/fraction changes at the date of supply.)

## Section 4 — Worked example (illustrative — confirm the liable fraction)

A manufacturer with gross turnover LKR 100,000,000 in a period, where the applicable liable-turnover fraction is (illustratively) 50%:

```
Liable turnover = 50% × 100,000,000 = 50,000,000
SSCL = 2.5% × 50,000,000 = LKR 1,250,000
```

The 50% fraction is **illustrative only** — the real fraction must be taken from the current SSCL schedule for the activity class.

## Section 5 — Filing

SSCL is administered by the IRD. Return/payment frequency and due dates — **VERIFY** against the current IRD SSCL guidance (not asserted here).

## Section 6 — Sources

1. IRD SSCL page — https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/Type%20of%20Taxes/SitePages/Social%20Security%20Contribution%20Levy%20(SSCL).aspx
2. IRD YA 2025/26 tax chart (SSCL 2.5% on liable turnover) — https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/SitePages/tax_chart_2526.aspx

**Known gaps / VERIFY:** principal-Act number/year; per-activity liable-turnover fractions; registration threshold; filing frequency and due dates; exemptions.

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER apply 2.5% to **gross** turnover for an activity whose liable-turnover fraction is below 100% — that over-states the levy.
- NEVER assert a per-activity liable-turnover fraction, a registration threshold, or filing dates this skill flags as VERIFY.
- NEVER treat SSCL as suspended — it is currently in force (re-confirm at the date of supply).
- NEVER file or instruct filing — produce a working paper for practitioner review.
