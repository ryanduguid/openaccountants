## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Montana taxable income begins with **federal taxable income** from federal Form 1040, Line 15 (after the federal standard or itemized deduction).

1. **Additions** — Add back items Montana does not exclude (limited; Montana closely conforms to federal definitions).
2. **Subtractions** — Subtract items Montana excludes:
   - Interest on U.S. government obligations
   - Montana state income tax refund included in federal taxable income
   - Age 65+ subtraction ($5,660 for TY 2025)
   - Qualified medical savings account contributions
3. **Montana taxable income** — Federal taxable income + additions − subtractions.
4. **Separate capital gains** — Net long-term capital gains are taxed at preferential Montana rates (3.0% / 4.1%) rather than the ordinary rates.
5. **Tax** — Apply the two-bracket rates to ordinary income, and the capital gains rates to qualifying gains.
6. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits (EITC, elderly homeowner/renter credit, etc.).

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** flows through federal Schedule C → federal AGI → federal taxable income → Montana taxable income. No separate Montana schedule for self-employment income.
2. **Federal SE tax deduction** — Already reflected in federal AGI/taxable income. No separate Montana adjustment.
3. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments (Form ESA) if expected liability exceeds $500 after withholding and credits. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
4. **Business equipment depreciation** — Montana generally conforms to federal depreciation, including IRC § 179. Montana conforms to bonus depreciation (IRC § 168(k)).
5. **Capital gains from business asset sales** — Net long-term capital gains (including from business asset dispositions) qualify for the preferential 3.0%/4.1% Montana rates. Short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income.
6. **Health insurance deduction** — Self-employed health insurance deduction is in federal AGI/taxable income. No Montana add-back.
7. **No sales tax** — Montana has no general sales tax, which means sole proprietors do not need to collect or remit sales tax on goods sold in Montana (some resort areas impose a local resort tax on specific goods/services).
8. **Montana EITC** — 20% of federal EITC (TY 2026+), refundable. Available to qualifying self-employed filers.

| MT-T2-03 | **Capital gains bracket interaction** — The 3.0% rate applies to capital gains that fall within the lower ordinary-income bracket (after subtracting Montana ordinary income from the threshold). | If ordinary income exceeds the lower bracket, all capital gains are taxed at 4.1%. |
| MT-T2-04 | **Elderly homeowner/renter credit** — Available to Montana residents age 62+ with household income below thresholds. | Income-based calculation; flag for review if taxpayer qualifies. |
| MT-T2-05 | **Credit for taxes paid to other states** — Non-refundable credit to prevent double taxation. | Requires the other state's return. |
| MT-T2-06 | **Resort tax** — Some Montana resort areas impose a local resort tax (up to 3%) on certain goods and services. Not an income tax, but self-employed persons in resort areas may need to collect it. | Flag if taxpayer operates in a resort community. |
