## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rate

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Pennsylvania personal income tax rate | **3.07% flat** (all income, all filing statuses) |

Pennsylvania does NOT have graduated brackets. All taxable income is taxed at the same 3.07% rate.

### Key differences from most states

| Feature | Pennsylvania rule |
|---|---|
| Standard deduction | **None** |
| Personal exemption | **None** |
| Itemized deductions | **Not allowed** (PA does not use federal Schedule A) |
| Starting point | **NOT federal AGI or federal taxable income** — PA computes each class of income independently |
| Net operating loss | **Not allowed** (losses in one class cannot offset income in another class) |
| Retirement income | **Fully exempt** (pensions, 401(k), IRA distributions, Social Security) |

### Eight classes of income

Pennsylvania taxes eight separate classes of income. Each class is computed independently, and losses in one class generally cannot offset income in another.

| Class | Description | Relevant to sole proprietors? |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Compensation | Wages, salaries, tips, fees | Yes (if also W-2 employed) |
| 2. Net profits | Business income (Schedule C equivalent) | **Yes — primary class** |
| 3. Interest | Interest income | Yes |
| 4. Dividends | Dividend income | Yes |
| 5. Rental/royalty | Net income from rents and royalties | Yes (if applicable) |
| 6. Estate/trust | Income from estates and trusts | Rare |
| 7. Gambling/lottery | Gambling and lottery winnings | If applicable |
| 8. Sale of property | Gains from sale of property | Yes (if applicable) |

### Tax forgiveness (low-income provision)

PA provides a "tax forgiveness" credit for low-income taxpayers based on eligibility income and family size.

| Eligibility income | Single (no dependents) | With 1 dependent | With 2+ dependents |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100% forgiveness | $6,500 or less | $6,500 plus $9,500 per dep | Varies |

The threshold increases are $9,500 per dependent for 2025. The program phases out gradually. See Schedule SP.

### Income threshold for filing

| Tax year | Filing threshold |
|---|---|
| 2025 | $11,000 |
| 2026 | $14,000 |

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Pennsylvania does NOT start from federal AGI or federal taxable income.** Instead, Pennsylvania computes each class of income independently using Pennsylvania-specific rules.

For a sole proprietor, the most important class is **Class 2: Net Profits**, which corresponds (roughly) to federal Schedule C but with significant differences:

**Key flow for self-employed:**

1. Compute PA net profits (PA Schedule C equivalent with PA-specific rules)
2. Compute each other class of income separately
3. Sum all eight classes → Total PA taxable income
4. Multiply by 3.07% → PA income tax before credits
5. Apply tax forgiveness (if eligible) and other credits → PA income tax liability

### Critical differences in computing net profits

Pennsylvania net profits computation starts similarly to federal Schedule C but **disallows many federal deductions:**

| Federal deduction | PA treatment |
|---|---|
| 50% of self-employment tax | **Not deductible** on PA return |
| Self-employed health insurance | **Not deductible** on PA return (but may be deductible as a business expense if structured correctly) |
| SEP/SIMPLE/solo 401(k) contributions | **Not deductible** on PA return (PA exempts the retirement income when distributed, but does not allow the contribution deduction) |
| Home office deduction | **Allowed** (if calculated per PA rules — generally follows federal) |
| Business expenses (Schedule C) | **Generally allowed** (ordinary and necessary business expenses are deductible) |
| Depreciation | **PA uses its own depreciation rules** — no bonus depreciation; PA follows federal MACRS but without §168(k) bonus |
| §179 expensing | **PA conforms to $25,000 limit** (not the federal $1,220,000+ limit). Excess must be depreciated under MACRS. |
| Net operating loss | **Not allowed** for individuals. Business losses cannot offset income from other classes, and PA does not allow NOL carryforward for individuals. |

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Net profits computation (Class 2)

The PA net profits computation is on PA Schedule C (different from federal Schedule C). The starting point is gross receipts minus cost of goods sold, minus allowable business expenses under PA rules.

**Key PA-specific disallowances:**
- **§179 limited to $25,000.** If the taxpayer claimed more than $25,000 in §179 on the federal return, the excess must be depreciated over the asset's life on the PA return.
- **No bonus depreciation.** PA does not conform to §168(k). Any bonus depreciation claimed federally must be added back, and regular MACRS depreciation substituted.
- **No NOL.** If net profits are negative, the loss stays within Class 2. It cannot reduce compensation (Class 1) or other income classes. PA does not allow individual NOL carryforward.

### Loss limitation (critical)

**Pennsylvania does not allow losses in one class of income to offset income in another class.** If a sole proprietor has a $20,000 loss in net profits (Class 2) and $80,000 in compensation (Class 1), the taxpayer pays 3.07% on $80,000. The $20,000 loss is wasted — it cannot be carried forward.

This is one of the most taxpayer-unfriendly provisions in the state tax landscape and catches many preparers off guard.

### Local earned income tax (warning)

Pennsylvania's over 2,500 municipalities and school districts impose local earned income taxes (EIT), typically 1%–3.9% combined. Self-employed individuals must file local EIT returns in their resident jurisdiction. The largest local taxes are:
- **Philadelphia:** 3.75% wage tax (residents) / 3.44% net profits tax (verify 2025)
- **Chester City:** 3.75%
- **Reading:** 3.6%

Local EIT is NOT covered by this skill but represents a significant additional tax burden.

### Reciprocal agreements

Pennsylvania has reciprocal agreements with IN, MD, NJ, OH, VA, and WV. If the taxpayer works in one of these states, only Pennsylvania taxes the compensation.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**R-PA-1. Flat rate of 3.07%.** All taxable income from all eight classes is taxed at 3.07%. No brackets, no graduated rates.

**R-PA-2. No standard deduction and no personal exemptions.** PA does not provide any standard deduction or personal exemption. All income is taxed from dollar one (subject to tax forgiveness for low-income filers).

**R-PA-3. §179 limited to $25,000.** If federal §179 exceeds $25,000, add back the excess on the PA return and depreciate over the asset's useful life.

**R-PA-4. No bonus depreciation.** Add back all §168(k) bonus depreciation claimed on the federal return. Substitute regular MACRS depreciation on the PA return.

**R-PA-5. No loss offsets between classes.** Business losses (Class 2) cannot offset compensation (Class 1) or any other class.

**R-PA-6. Retirement income is fully exempt.** Pensions, 401(k) distributions, IRA distributions, and Social Security are all exempt from PA income tax when received. However, the contributions are NOT deductible when made (no above-the-line deduction for SEP/SIMPLE/solo 401(k) on PA return).

**R-PA-7. Tax forgiveness for low-income filers.** Apply Schedule SP to determine if the taxpayer qualifies for partial or full forgiveness of PA income tax.

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**J-PA-1. Business expense classification.** Because PA computes net profits using its own rules, judgment is needed to determine which federal Schedule C expenses are allowable under PA law. Most ordinary and necessary business expenses are allowed, but some items differ.

**J-PA-2. Self-employed health insurance deductibility.** The federal above-the-line deduction for self-employed health insurance is NOT allowed on the PA return. However, if health insurance premiums are a legitimate business expense of the sole proprietorship (e.g., paid by the business), they may be deductible on PA Schedule C. The distinction requires judgment.

**J-PA-3. Depreciation reconciliation.** When federal and PA depreciation differ (due to §179 and §168(k) differences), a depreciation schedule tracking PA basis vs. federal basis is required for all depreciable assets.

**J-PA-4. Residency determination.** PA considers a person domiciled in PA as a resident. The statutory residency test (183+ days in PA) also applies. For taxpayers who moved, part-year resident rules apply.

## Section 7: Supplier pattern library

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| Heavy equipment purchaser | Large §179 claim federally. PA limits §179 to $25,000 — must add back excess and compute PA MACRS. Creates ongoing PA/federal depreciation tracking requirement. |
| Schedule C loss with W-2 income | PA does not allow Class 2 loss to offset Class 1 compensation. Taxpayer pays 3.07% on full W-2 income despite business loss. |
| SEP contributor | SEP contribution is not deductible on PA return. PA tax on the contribution amount now, but exempt when distributed in retirement. |
| Low-income freelancer | Check Schedule SP for tax forgiveness. Full forgiveness available if eligibility income is below threshold. |
| Philadelphia resident | Additional 3.75% city wage tax on all earned income (compensation + net profits). Massive additional burden. |

## Section 9: Refusal catalogue

**REFUSE-PA-1.** REFUSE to prepare a PA return for a part-year resident or nonresident without determining the apportionment of each class of income to PA-source income.

**REFUSE-PA-2.** REFUSE to allow losses in one class of income to offset income in another class. This is a hard rule — no exceptions.

**REFUSE-PA-3.** REFUSE to apply federal §179 amounts above $25,000 on the PA return. The excess must be depreciated.

**REFUSE-PA-4.** REFUSE to apply federal bonus depreciation on the PA return. PA does not conform to §168(k).

**REFUSE-PA-5.** REFUSE to compute local earned income tax (EIT), Philadelphia wage/net profits tax, or school district taxes. These are separate filings with separate rules.

**REFUSE-PA-6.** REFUSE to deduct SEP, SIMPLE, or solo 401(k) contributions on the PA return. PA does not allow these deductions (but exempts the distributions in retirement).
