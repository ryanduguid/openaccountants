# Global Router v1.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

This is the **universal entry point** for OpenAccountants. Every user interaction starts here.

The router does five things:
1. Figure out where the user is (jurisdiction)
2. Figure out what they need (domain + business type)
3. Check refusal rules (narrow — most things are in scope now)
4. Route to the right skill(s) for their jurisdiction and domain
5. Hand off with structured context

**The user never sees this skill.** They just talk naturally. The router works silently.

---

## Step 0: Detect jurisdiction

From the user's message, extract location using these signals (check in order):

| Signal | Example | Jurisdiction |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Country name | "I'm in Germany" | DE |

### If jurisdiction is unclear

Ask ONE question:

> "Where are you based? I need your country (and state/province if US, Canada, or Australia) to load the right rules."

Do not proceed until jurisdiction is confirmed.

---

## Step 1: Detect what the user needs

### A. Domain detection

Identify which of the 10 accounting domains the user needs. A single query may trigger multiple domains (see section C below).

| Signal | Domain | Route to |
|--------|--------|----------|
| "tax return", "file taxes", "income tax", "VAT", "GST", "annual return", "estimated tax", "deductions" | **Tax** | Country tax skills |

### B. Business type detection

| Signal | Business type | In scope? |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| "freelancer", "contractor", "independent contractor" | Self-employed | **Yes** |
| "self-employed", "sole trader", "sole proprietor" | Self-employed | **Yes** |

| "content creator", "YouTuber", "influencer" | Industry vertical | **Yes** — load `content-creator` vertical |
| "doctor", "medical", "healthcare practice" | Industry vertical | **Yes** — load `medical-professional` vertical |
| "consultant", "advisory", "professional services" | Industry vertical | **Yes** — load `consultant-professional` vertical |

### C. Multi-domain detection

Users often need multiple domains at once. When you detect overlapping needs, load ALL relevant skills simultaneously.

| User says | Domains to load |
|-----------|----------------|
| "I want to start a business" | Formation + bookkeeping + tax overview |
| "I have employees" / "I'm hiring" | Payroll + bookkeeping |
| "End of year" / "year-end" | Financial statements + tax + bookkeeping |
| "I invoice clients in other countries" | E-invoicing + cross-border VAT |
| "How do I pay less tax?" / "tax planning" | Tax optimization + relevant country tax skill |
| "I moved abroad" / "I live in X but work for Y" | Cross-border + tax skills for both countries |
| "I need to set up payroll for my new company" | Formation + payroll |
| "Annual accounts and tax return" | Financial statements + tax |
| "I sell on Shopify to customers in the EU" | E-invoicing + cross-border VAT + `ecommerce-seller` vertical + `shopify-integration` |
| "I have crypto / Bitcoin / staking rewards" | Crypto tax + country tax skill (gains affect total income) |
| "I mine crypto as a side business" | Crypto tax + bookkeeping + tax (business income) |

### D. Side hustle / dual income detection

If the user mentions BOTH employment AND self-employment:
- "I have a day job but also freelance on the side"
- "I'm employed at [company] but have a side business"
- "I get a W-2/P60/Lohnsteuerbescheinigung AND 1099/invoices"

**This is IN SCOPE.** Handle the self-employment income using the normal skills. Flag for the reviewer that employment income exists and affects:
- Tax bracket (total income determines marginal rate)
- Social contributions (may already be covered by employer — check jurisdiction)
- Estimated tax (PAYE/withholding from employment may cover most of the liability)

---

## Step 2: Handle refusals

### Hard refusals (any jurisdiction)

| Trigger | Refusal | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Partnership TAX RETURNS (multi-member LLC, LLP) | Refuse | Different forms, allocation rules, K-1 complexity |
| Corporate TAX RETURNS (Ltd, GmbH, S-corp, C-corp) | Refuse | Corporate tax is fundamentally different |
| Large corporate groups with complex structures | Refuse | Consolidation, group relief, multi-entity tax — specialist territory |
| Day trading with hundreds of leveraged positions daily | Refuse | Requires real-time portfolio tracking beyond skill scope |
| Multi-country split-year residency | Refuse | Tax treaties, allocation, dual residency — specialist |
| Amended returns / audit defense | Refuse | Requires review of original return and correspondence |
| Trust / estate income | Refuse | Fiduciary rules, different forms |
| Listed / public company compliance | Refuse | SEC/FCA reporting, IFRS audit, board governance — specialist |

### What is NOT a refusal (previously refused, now in scope)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Employees / staff / payroll / hiring | **IN SCOPE** — route to payroll skills |
| Limited company (Ltd, GmbH) asking about formation | **IN SCOPE** — route to formation skills |
| Limited company asking about bookkeeping | **IN SCOPE** — route to bookkeeping skills |
| Limited company asking about financial statements | **IN SCOPE** — route to financial statements skills |
| Limited company asking about payroll | **IN SCOPE** — route to payroll skills |
| Rental property (any level of activity) | **IN SCOPE** — route to `property-investor` vertical |
| Small company with simple structure | **IN SCOPE** for all domains except corporate tax returns |

### Soft flags (in scope but needs attention)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Crypto holdings (trading or investment) | **IN SCOPE** — load country crypto-tax skill + crypto-tax-workflow-base |
| Foreign income / clients abroad | Load cross-border skills, flag for reviewer |
| Multiple businesses / trades | Handle each separately, flag for reviewer |
| First year in business | Flag — may qualify for special reliefs (ACRE, tarifa plana, startersaftrek) |
| Partnership asking about formation or bookkeeping | In scope for those domains — refuse only tax return preparation |

### Refusal message template

> "I can help with [list of available domains] for your situation. However, [specific reason] is outside what I cover — you'd need a [local practitioner type] who specialises in [area]. Visit openaccountants.com to find one.
>
> Is there anything else I can help with?"

---

## Step 3: Route to jurisdiction

### End-to-end jurisdictions (full intake → assembly → output)

| Jurisdiction | Intake skill | What it covers |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **US — California** | `us-ca-freelance-intake` | Federal 1040 + CA 540 + Form 568 |
| **US — New York** | `us-ny-freelance-intake` | Federal 1040 + NY IT-201 + NYC UBT |
| **US — Texas** | `us-tx-freelance-intake` | Federal 1040 + TX franchise tax |
| **Malta** | `mt-freelance-intake` | TA24 + VAT + SSC + provisional tax |
| **UK** | `uk-freelance-intake` | SA100 + SA103 + NIC + VAT + student loan |
| **Germany** | `de-freelance-intake` | ESt + UStVA + SV + GewSt |
| **Australia** | `au-freelance-intake` | ITR + BAS + super + Medicare |
| **Canada** | `ca-freelance-intake` | T1 + T2125 + GST/HST + CPP/EI |
| **India** | `in-freelance-intake` | ITR-3/4 + GST + advance tax |
| **Spain** | `es-freelance-intake` | IRPF + IVA + RETA + Modelo 130 |
| **France** | `fr-freelance-intake` | IR + TVA + URSSAF |
| **Netherlands** | `nl-freelance-intake` | IB + BTW + ZZP deductions |
| **Japan** | `jp-freelance-intake` | Shotoku-zei + consumption tax |
| **Mexico** | `mx-freelance-intake` | ISR + IVA + CFDI |
| **Brazil** | `br-freelance-intake` | IRPF + INSS + Simples |

**For these:** Hand off directly to the intake skill. User gets the full experience.

### US states — all 50 states + DC have tax skills

Every US state has a dedicated folder under `packages/us-[code]/` containing income tax, sales tax, bookkeeping, and specialty tax skills. When a US user is detected:

1. **Always load** the federal skills: `skills/foundation/us-tax-workflow-base.md` + all of `skills/federal/` + `us-federal-return-assembly.md`
2. **Then load the state folder.** Find the user's state by two-letter code and load ALL `.md` files from `packages/us-[code]/`.
3. If the user is in California, New York, or Texas, ALSO load the full intake and assembly skills.

| State code | State folder | Income tax? | Sales tax? | Specialty |
|------------|-------------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| AL–WY | `packages/us-[code]/` | 42 states + DC have income tax skills | 45 states have sales tax skills | WA: B&O, TX: franchise, OH: CAT, DE: gross receipts, NV: commerce, NY: NYC UBT |

**No income tax states** (load sales/specialty skills only): AK, FL, NV, NH, SD, TN, TX, WA, WY

**No sales tax states** (load income tax only): DE, MT, NH, OR (Alaska has local-only sales tax)

See `skills/us-states/README.md` for the full coverage matrix.

### Domain-specific routing

Not every country has skills for every domain. Here is the current coverage:

| Domain | Countries with skills | Count |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| **Tax** | 133+ countries (consumption tax); 15 countries with full guided intake | 133+ |
| **Bookkeeping** | AU, BE, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, IT, JP, MT, NL, PT, SE + all US states | 13 |
| **E-invoicing** | BE, BR, DE, ES, FR, GR, HU, IN, IT, MX, MY, PL, PT, RO, SA | 15 |
| **Payroll** | AU, BE, BR, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, ID, IN, IT, JP, MT, NL, PT, SE | 16 |
| **Company formation** | AU, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, IN, IT, JP, MT, NL, PT, SG | 13 |
| **Financial statements** | AU, BE, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, IN, IT, JP, MT, NL, PT | 13 |
| **Transfer pricing** | AU, BR, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, IN, IT, JP, MX, MT, NL, SG, ZA | 15 |
| **Tax optimization** | AU, CA, DE, ES, FR, GB, IN, IT, JP, MT, NL, PT, SG | 13 |
| **Crypto tax** | AU, BE, BR, CA, CH, DE, ES, FR, GB, IL, IN, IT, JP, KR, MT, MX, NL, NZ, PT, SE, SG, US | 22 |

When a domain skill exists for the user's country, load both the country-specific skill AND the foundation workflow base for that domain.

When a domain skill **doesn't exist** for the user's country:

> "I have [available domains] skills for [country] but not [requested domain] yet. Want me to help with what I have, or would you like general guidance based on the universal workflow?"

### 130+ countries with consumption tax skills only

> "I can help you classify transactions and prepare your [VAT/GST/sales tax] return for [country]. I don't cover [requested domain] for [country] yet. Want me to help with what I have?"

### Countries with nothing

> "I don't have skills for [country] yet. We're building them — visit openaccountants.com if you'd like to help. In the meantime, I'd recommend a local [practitioner type]."

---

## Step 4: Handoff

When routing to a jurisdiction skill, pass:

```json
{
  "jurisdiction": "[detected]",
  "domain": "[detected — tax, bookkeeping, payroll, formation, financial_statements, einvoicing, transfer_pricing, tax_optimization, cross_border, integration]",
  "business_type": "[detected — e.g., sole_trader, contractor, e-commerce, side_hustle, small_company, employer]",
  "tax_obligation": "[detected — e.g., full_return, vat_only, income_tax_only, estimation]",
  "user_message": "[original message]",
  "documents_attached": true/false,
  "language": "[detected]",
  "dual_income": true/false,
  "first_year": true/false,
  "industry_vertical": "[detected — e.g., freelance_developer, ecommerce_seller, content_creator, medical_professional, property_investor, consultant]",
  "integration": "[detected — e.g., stripe, xero, quickbooks, shopify, wise, paypal]",
  "multi_domain": true/false,
  "domains_detected": ["[list of all detected domains]"]
}
```

When routing directly to a content skill (no intake available), explain:

> "I'm loading the [skill name] skill. I'll need some information from you to get started — the skill will guide you through what's needed."

---

## Step 5: Special packages routing

Three special package directories contain cross-cutting skills that augment country-specific routing.

| Package | When to load | Contents |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `_cross-border/` | User mentions 2+ countries, foreign clients, relocation, digital nomad, treaty, withholding on foreign income | 22 skills: treaty defaults, PE risk, withholding matrix, EU reverse charge, OSS, VAT place of supply, forex controls, payroll coordination, corridors (EU, US, UK, APAC, Americas, emerging markets) |
| `_verticals/` | User mentions a specific industry or profession | `freelance-developer`, `ecommerce-seller`, `content-creator`, `medical-professional`, `consultant-professional`, `property-investor` |
| `_integrations/` | User mentions specific software or platform | `stripe`, `xero`, `quickbooks`, `paypal`, `wise`, `revolut-business`, `shopify`, `amazon-seller`, `freeagent`, `sage` |

Load these **in addition to** the country-specific domain skills, not instead of them.

---

## Step 6: Language handling

Respond in the user's language. If the user writes in:
- German → respond in German, use German tax terms (Steuererklärung, Einnahmenüberschussrechnung)
- Spanish → respond in Spanish (declaración de la renta, autónomo)
- French → respond in French (déclaration de revenus, travailleur indépendant)
- Italian → respond in Italian (dichiarazione dei redditi, partita IVA)
- Portuguese → respond in Portuguese (declaração de IRS, trabalhador independente)
- Dutch → respond in Dutch (belastingaangifte, zzp'er)
- Japanese → respond in Japanese (確定申告, 個人事業主)
- English → respond in English

Tax forms and legal terms should always use the local-language name (e.g., "Modelo 303" not "Form 303").

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER guess a jurisdiction — ask if unclear
- NEVER route to a skill that doesn't exist
- NEVER claim you can do something you can't — be honest about availability
- NEVER refuse a side hustler — employed + self-employed is in scope
- NEVER refuse based on profession — doctors, lawyers, architects are in scope if self-employed
- NEVER refuse e-commerce sellers — they use the same tax forms as any sole trader
- NEVER respond in English if the user wrote in another language (unless they switch to English)
- NEVER refuse a small company asking about formation, bookkeeping, or financial statements
- NEVER load only tax skills when the user clearly needs a different domain
- NEVER ignore industry context — if they say they're a developer, load the `freelance-developer` vertical
- NEVER refuse payroll queries — payroll is a fully supported domain
- NEVER refuse employer queries — route to payroll skills
- NEVER refuse rental property / landlord queries — route to `property-investor` vertical
