## Papua New Guinea Income Tax -- Employee & Self-Employed Skill v0.1

## REGIME-CHANGE WARNING -- two regimes in play

REGIME-CHANGE WARNING -- two regimes in play.
- 2025 tax year is governed by the Income Tax Act 1959 (as amended), with salary/wages tax rates set by the Income Tax (Salary or Wages Tax)(Rates)(2025 Budget) Act 2024.
- A new Income Tax Act 2025 entered into force on 1 January 2026 (first returns due in 2027). It rewrites and simplifies the law and introduces a narrow 15% CGT regime, changes to benefit valuations, and salary-packaging limits. The individual rate brackets and thresholds below are not reported to have changed under the new Act, but author/reviewer must re-verify 2026 figures against the Act text before publishing 2026-specific advice. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the new Income Tax Act 2025 alters individual brackets/thresholds for 2026; Act text at https://www.parliament.gov.pg/uploads/acts/25A-11.pdf]
- The bracket figures in this skill are confirmed current as of the PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries review dated 27 March 2026.

### Resident Tax Rate Brackets (2024 onward; applies to 2025)

- **Threshold elimination rule** — Tax-free threshold: PGK 20,000. The former 22% first band was eliminated for residents when the threshold rose to PGK 20,000 (effective 1 Jan 2024). Do not use older tables showing a 22% resident first bracket.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Taxes on personal income (reviewed 27 March 2026))_

**Resident Tax Rate Brackets (2024 onward; applies to 2025)**  _(PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — PNG Individual, Taxes on personal income (reviewed 27 March 2026). Cross-check against the Income Tax (Salary or Wages Tax)(Rates)(2025 Budget) Act 2024 (IRC).)_

| Taxable income (PGK) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 20,000 | 0% (nil) | K 0 |
| 20,001 -- 33,000 | 30% | K 3,900 |
| 33,001 -- 70,000 | 35% | K 16,850 |
| 70,001 -- 250,000 | 40% | K 88,850 |
| Over 250,000 | 42% | -- |

### Non-Resident Tax Rate Brackets

- **Non-resident threshold rule** — Non-residents do not receive the tax-free threshold. The first Kina is taxed at 22%.  _(PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — PNG Individual, Taxes on personal income (reviewed 27 March 2026))_

**Non-Resident Tax Rate Brackets**  _(PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — PNG Individual, Taxes on personal income (reviewed 27 March 2026))_

| 70,001 -- 250,000 | 40% | K 93,250 |
| Over 250,000 | 42% | -- |

### Superannuation (Compulsory) — Contribution Rates

**Superannuation (Compulsory) — Contribution Rates**  _(PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — PNG Individual, Other taxes (reviewed 27 March 2026); Superannuation (General Provisions) Act)_

| Party | Rate | Base |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 6.0% | Gross basic salary (after-tax) |
| Employer | 8.4% | Gross basic salary (pre-tax) |
| **Combined** | **14.4%** | Gross basic salary excl. overtime, bonus, commission |

No published Kina floor/ceiling on the contribution base was found. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm: treat as "no stated contribution cap" rather than assuming one.]

### Other Key Rates

**Other Key Rates**

| Item | Rate / Threshold | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GST | 10% on most goods and services | PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes |
| GST registration threshold | Annual turnover PGK 250,000 (voluntary below) | PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes; IRC GST page |
| Corporate income tax | 30% (resident companies; PNG PEs of non-residents) | PwC PNG Corporate, Taxes on corporate income; IRC |
| Capital gains tax (from 1 Jan 2026) | 15% — narrow; extractive/resource interests | PwC "Income Tax Act 2025"; KPMG Guide 2025 |

| Minimum wage (from 1 Jan 2026) | PGK 5.00 / hour (K5.25 in 2027; K5.50 in 2028) | ILO; WageIndicator |

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency | STOP — residency determines whether the K20,000 threshold applies |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown whether income already SWT-taxed at source | Treat as final-taxed employment income (no return) until confirmed |
| Unknown whether superannuation applies | Apply 6%/8.4% only for PNG-citizen employees > 59 days in any 3-month period |
| Unknown asset / depreciation life | Flag for reviewer — capital allowance rates not set in this skill |
| Unknown GST registration status | Assume not registered (turnover below PGK 250,000) until confirmed |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

Minimum viable — bank statement (and/or payslips) for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residency status (resident / non-resident) and income type (employment only / self-employment / mixed).

Recommended — payslips showing fortnightly SWT withheld, superannuation statements (Nambawan Super / Nasfund), sales and purchase invoices, prior year assessment or return, GST registration status.

Ideal — complete income and expenditure account, asset register, provisional tax payment confirmations, employer SWT remittance records, full payroll detail.

Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN. No bank statement or payslip at all = hard stop. Bank statement alone (no payslips/invoices) = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that SWT was correctly withheld at source and that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-PG-1 — Residency unknown** — Residency determines whether the PGK 20,000 tax-free threshold applies (residents) or whether the first Kina is taxed at 22% (non-residents). This skill cannot compute tax without confirmed residency status. Please confirm before proceeding.
- **R-PG-2 — Companies, partnerships, trusts** — This skill covers individuals (employees and sole traders) only. Companies (30% CIT), partnerships, and trusts file separate returns. Escalate to a PNG-registered tax agent.
- **R-PG-3 — Extractive / resource interests and CGT** — Disposals of taxable assets tied to mining, petroleum, or resource rights — including indirect disposals via a 10% or greater beneficial-ownership change — fall under the new 15% CGT regime (from 1 Jan 2026) and are out of scope. Escalate to a PNG-registered tax agent.
- **R-PG-4 — Mixed expatriate / foreign-source income** — Expatriate packages, double-tax-treaty relief, and foreign-source income require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a PNG-registered tax agent.
- **R-PG-5 — Arrears / IRC enforcement** — Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to IRC enforcement. Late-payment penalties (20% p.a.) and additional tax for failure to furnish (up to 100% of tax) are severe. Do not advise. Escalate to a PNG-registered tax agent immediately.
- **R-PG-6 — GST return requested** — This skill covers income tax / salary or wages tax only. PNG GST (10%) is a separate return. Escalate or use a dedicated PNG GST skill.
- **R-PG-7 — 2026 return under the new Act** — Returns for the 2026 tax year are governed by the Income Tax Act 2025 (in force 1 Jan 2026, first returns due 2027), which may change benefit valuations, salary-packaging limits, and introduces CGT. Do not finalise a 2026 computation from this 2025-based skill without reviewer confirmation against the Act text.

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

How to read this table. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules. Many PNG employees are taxed entirely at source under SWT (final tax) — for those, no income tax return is required and the patterns are used only to confirm there is no untaxed side income.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits on Bank Statement)

**3.1 Income Patterns (Credits on Bank Statement)**

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in Papua New Guinea Kina (PGK / K).

### Example 1 -- Salary credit (employee, SWT final tax)

**Input line:**
`14/03/2025 ; BSP EFT CREDIT ; HIGHLANDS COFFEE LTD ; FORTNIGHT PAY ENDING 13/03 ; +2,450.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Net fortnightly salary already taxed under SWT at source. SWT is a final tax for an employee whose only income is fully-taxed employment income — no annual income tax return is required. The K2,450 is net pay; gross and SWT appear on the payslip, not the bank statement.

**Classification:** Employment income, SWT final tax. No further income tax due. EXCLUDE from any self-employment computation.

### Example 2 -- Sole-trader client payment (GST-registered)

**Input line:**
`20/03/2025 ; KINA BANK TRANSFER IN ; MOROBE TRADING LTD ; INV-0042 ; +1,100.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Payment for services. Client is GST-registered (turnover over PGK 250,000), so K1,100 includes 10% GST. Net business income = K1,000 (K1,100 ÷ 1.10). K100 is GST collected — a liability to IRC, excluded from income.

**Classification:** Business income = K1,000. GST K100 excluded.

### Example 3 -- Superannuation contribution (employee 6%)

**Input line:**
`14/03/2025 ; BSP DD ; NAMBAWAN SUPER ; MEMBER CONTRIBUTION ; -147.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Employee superannuation contribution is 6.0% of gross basic salary. For a fortnight where gross basic salary is K2,450, the employee contribution is 6% × 2,450 = K147.00 (the employer separately contributes 8.4% × 2,450 = K205.80). Source: PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes. The employee contribution is not a business expense.

**Classification:** Superannuation (employee 6%). Confirm gross basic salary excludes overtime/bonus/commission.

### Example 4 -- Fuel (mixed-use vehicle)

**Input line:**
`02/04/2025 ; ANZ CARD ; PUMA ENERGY WAIGANI ; FUEL ; -180.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Vehicle fuel for a sole trader. Only the business-use percentage is deductible, and only with a mileage log. Tier 2 — conservative default is 0% deduction until the business percentage is documented.

**Classification:** T2. Default K0 deductible until mileage log confirms business %.

### Example 5 -- Income tax / provisional tax payment (not deductible)

**Input line:**
`28/09/2025 ; BSP TRANSFER ; INTERNAL REVENUE COMMISSION ; PROVISIONAL TAX 2025 ; -3,000.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Provisional tax is a payment on account against the year's assessed income tax — it is not a business expense. It is credited against the final assessed liability, not deducted from income. Provisional tax is due no earlier than 30 September of the year of income.

**Classification:** Provisional tax paid (credit against assessed tax). NOT a deduction.

### Example 6 -- Resident sole trader, full-year tax computation

**Inputs:** Resident sole trader. Gross business income K120,000; allowable expenses K35,000 → taxable income K85,000.

**Reasoning (resident brackets):**
- 0 – 20,000 at 0% = K0
- 20,001 – 33,000 at 30% = 30% × 13,000 = K3,900
- 33,001 – 70,000 at 35% = 35% × 37,000 = K12,950
- 70,001 – 85,000 at 40% = 40% × 15,000 = K6,000
- Total income tax = 0 + 3,900 + 12,950 + 6,000 = K22,850

If K3,000 provisional tax was already paid (Example 5), balance due on assessment = 22,850 − 3,000 = K19,850.

**Classification:** Income tax K22,850; balance due K19,850 after provisional tax credit.

### Example 7 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BSP TRANSFER ; OWN ACCOUNT - SAVINGS ; ; -2,000.00 ; PGK`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency and the Tax-Free Threshold

- **Residency threshold rule** — Residents receive a PGK 20,000 tax-free threshold (effective 1 Jan 2024). Non-residents receive no threshold — the first Kina is taxed at 22%. Residency must be confirmed before any rate table is applied (see R-PG-1).  _(PwC PNG Individual, Taxes on personal income)_

### 5.2 Salary or Wages Tax (SWT / PAYE)

- **SWT mechanics** — SWT is assessed fortnightly using standard fortnightly tax tables, regardless of actual pay frequency. It operates as a final tax for employees whose only income is fully-taxed employment income — those employees do not lodge an annual return. The employer withholds SWT each fortnight and remits monthly to IRC before the 7th day of the following month.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration; IRC SWT guidance)_

### 5.3 Who Must Lodge an Annual Return

- **Annual return requirement** — Anyone with non-salary income must lodge an annual income tax return, including the self-employed and anyone with interest, dividends, rental, trust distribution, or partnership income.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_

### 5.4 Provisional Tax (self-employed / non-salary income)

- **Provisional tax threshold** — Provisional tax applies to non-salary/wages income exceeding PGK 100.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_
- **Provisional tax amount basis** — It is generally set equal to the prior year's assessed income tax (reducible by application lodged before the due date).  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_
- **Provisional tax due date** — Provisional tax payment is due no earlier than 30 September of the year of income.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_
- **Assessment payment due date** — Tax shown on a notice of assessment is due within 30 days of service of the notice.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_

### 5.5 Filing Deadlines (individuals)

**5.5 Filing Deadlines (individuals)**  _(PwC PNG Individual, Tax administration)_

| Lodgement method | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| Through a registered tax agent | 30 June of the following year |
| Self-lodged (no tax agent) | 28 February of the following year |

### 5.6 Dependant Rebates — REPEALED

- **Dependant rebates repealed** — Dependant rebates have been repealed as a simplification measure and are no longer available for 2025 declarations. Do not apply them. (Historical, now-defunct detail: 1st dependant 15% of gross tax, max K450/min K45; 2nd & 3rd dependants 10% each, max K300/min K30; overall cap K1,050/yr; no rebate beyond 3 dependants.)  _(PwC PNG Individual, Other tax credits and incentives)_

### 5.7 Superannuation

**5.7 Superannuation rules**

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Employer obligation | Mandatory for employers with **15 or more** employees — must register with an authorised fund |
| Employee coverage | Compulsory for **PNG-citizen** employees working **> 59 days in any 3-month period**; voluntary for non-citizens |
| Employee contribution | **6.0%** of gross basic salary (after-tax) |
| Employer contribution | **8.4%** of gross basic salary (pre-tax) |
| Contribution base | Gross **basic** salary — excludes overtime, bonus, commission |
| Contribution ceiling | None found — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm no salary cap on the contribution base] |

- **Superannuation legislation and funds** — Legislation: Superannuation (General Provisions) Act. Main authorised funds: Nambawan Super (public sector), Nasfund (private sector).  _(Superannuation (General Provisions) Act)_

**Superannuation withdrawal/distribution tax (concessional, by membership length)**  _(PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes)_

| Membership length | Withdrawal tax |
| --- | --- |
| Under 5 years | Marginal rate |
| 5 – 9 years | Lesser of 15% or marginal rate |
| 9 – 15 years | Lesser of 8% or marginal rate |
| Over 15 years | 2% |

### 5.8 GST Interaction

**5.8 GST Interaction**  _(PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes; IRC GST page)_

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| GST-registered, GST collected on sales | NOT income — exclude from business income |
| GST-registered, input GST recovered | NOT an expense — exclude |
| Not GST-registered (turnover < PGK 250,000) | All GST paid on purchases is part of the gross cost (deductible as expense) |

- **GST rate and registration threshold** — GST rate 10%; registration threshold turnover PGK 250,000.  _(PwC PNG Individual, Other taxes; IRC GST page)_

### 5.9 Non-Deductible Expenses

**5.9 Non-Deductible Expenses**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment (client meals, events) | Generally blocked — flag for reviewer |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax / SWT itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Superannuation employee contribution | Personal contribution, not a business expense |
| Provisional tax | Credit against assessed tax, not a deduction |

### 5.10 Penalties

**5.10 Penalties**

| Item | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Late lodgement of income tax return | Additional tax up to **100% of the tax** for failure to furnish | KPMG PNG Tax Profile; IRC practice |
| Late payment of income tax / provisional tax | **20% per annum** late-payment penalty | KPMG PNG Tax Profile |
| SWT (PAYE) non-compliance | Commonly **20% flat additional tax plus 20% interest** on unremitted amounts; remittance due before the 7th of the following month | KPMG PNG Tax Profile; SmartBiz Pacific (IRC practice) |

Caveat: these percentages come from Big-4 profile + secondary IRC-practice sources, not a directly-parsed IRC penalty schedule. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to re-confirm exact penalty percentages against the current statute text, including penalty provisions carried into the Income Tax Act 2025.]

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction (self-employed)

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room(s) as a percentage of total rooms or floor area).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity (PNG Power), water (Water PNG / Eda Ranu), and internet.
- A dual-use room does not qualify.

Conservative default: 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the room arrangement.
Flag for reviewer: Confirm room count, floor-area basis, and that the workspace is genuinely dedicated.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use (self-employed)

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and running costs is deductible.
- Client must maintain a mileage log (business vs total mileage).

Conservative default: 0% business use until a mileage log is provided.
Flag for reviewer: Confirm the business percentage is documented and reasonable.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only (Digicel, bmobile, Telikom).

Conservative default: 0% deduction until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Capital Allowances / Depreciation

- Business assets are depreciated, not expensed. This skill does not set PNG capital-allowance rates.

Conservative default: flag any asset purchase for the reviewer.
Flag for reviewer: [RESEARCH GAP — PNG depreciation/capital-allowance rates not captured in this skill; reviewer to apply the correct Income Tax Act schedule.]

### 6.5 Entertainment

- Generally non-deductible; reviewer to confirm whether any narrow business exception applies.

### 6.6 Residency Edge Cases

- Part-year residents, expatriates, and those present under specific day-count tests require reviewer judgement on which threshold/rate table applies.

### Test Suite

All figures recomputed end-to-end against the resident/non-resident bracket tables in Section 1.

Input: Resident, taxable income K85,000.
Expected: 0 (first 20,000) + 3,900 (30% × 13,000) + 12,950 (35% × 37,000) + 6,000 (40% × 15,000) = income tax K22,850.

Input: Resident, taxable income K33,000.
Expected: 0 + 30% × 13,000 = K3,900 (matches cumulative-tax column).

Input: Resident, taxable income K70,000.
Expected: 3,900 + 12,950 = K16,850 (matches cumulative-tax column).

Input: Resident, taxable income K300,000.
Expected: 88,850 (cumulative at 250,000) + 42% × 50,000 = 88,850 + 21,000 = K109,850.

Input: Non-resident, taxable income K85,000.
Expected: 4,400 (22% × 20,000) + 3,900 (30% × 13,000) + 12,950 (35% × 37,000) + 6,000 (40% × 15,000) = K27,250 (= resident K22,850 + K4,400 lost threshold).

Input: Gross basic fortnight salary K2,450 (excl. OT/bonus/commission).
Expected: Employee 6% = K147.00; Employer 8.4% = K205.80; combined 14.4% = K352.80.

Input: Employee, only income is salary fully taxed under SWT at source.
Expected: No annual income tax return required; SWT is the final tax.

Input: Resident sole trader, income tax K22,850, provisional tax paid K3,000.
Expected: Provisional tax credited against assessed tax → balance due 22,850 − 3,000 = K19,850. Provisional tax is NOT deducted from income.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a rate table without knowing residency (residents get the K20,000 threshold; non-residents do not)
- NEVER apply the eliminated 22% first band to a resident
- NEVER apply repealed dependant rebates
- NEVER treat provisional tax as a deduction — it is a credit against assessed tax
- NEVER treat the employee superannuation contribution as a business expense
- NEVER allow income tax or SWT itself as a deduction
- NEVER allow fines or penalties as a deduction
- NEVER include GST collected on sales in business income for a GST-registered client
- NEVER require an annual return from an employee whose only income is fully SWT-taxed at source
- NEVER finalise a 2026 computation from this 2025-based skill without reviewer confirmation against the Income Tax Act 2025
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pass to the deterministic engine
