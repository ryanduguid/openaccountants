| 3+ dependents | 1 percentage point reduction in highest applicable marginal rate |

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Monthly Salary (Single, No Dependents, Continent)

```
Base salary:                         EUR 1,800.00
Meal allowance (22 days × 7.63):    +EUR   167.86 (card, exempt from SS/IRS)
Gross for SS/IRS purposes:           EUR 1,800.00
- Employee SS (11%):                 -EUR   198.00
= Taxable base for IRS:              EUR 1,602.00
- IRS withholding (~14.5%):          -EUR   ~232.00
= Net salary:                        EUR 1,370.00
+ Meal allowance:                   +EUR   167.86
= Total received:                    EUR ~1,538.00

Employer cost:
  Base salary:                       EUR 1,800.00
+ Employer SS (23.75%):             +EUR   427.50
+ FCT (1%):                         +EUR    18.00
+ Meal allowance:                   +EUR   167.86
= Monthly employer cost:             EUR ~2,413.36
```

### Pattern 2: Minimum Wage Worker (2026)

```
Base salary (RMMG):                  EUR   920.00
- Employee SS (11%):                 -EUR   101.20
- IRS withholding:                   -EUR     0.00 (exempt -- mínimo de existência)
= Net salary:                        EUR   818.80

Annual cost:
  14 months × 920 × 1.2375 (with employer SS) = EUR 15,939.00
  + FCT 1% on 14 months = EUR 128.80
  Total annual employer cost ≈ EUR 16,068
```

### Pattern 3: Holiday Subsidy Month (June)

In June, employee receives double payment:
- Normal June salary (subject to SS + IRS at standard rate)
- Holiday subsidy = 1 month base salary (subject to SS + IRS separately)

Each payment has IRS calculated independently using the same withholding rate.

### Pattern 4: Termination Settlement

| Component | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Outstanding salary | Days worked in final month / 30 × salary |
| Proportional holiday subsidy | Months worked / 12 × monthly salary |
| Proportional Christmas subsidy | Months worked / 12 × monthly salary |
| Untaken holiday (current year) | Proportional to 22 days |
| Untaken holiday (carried over) | Full days × daily rate |
| Compensation (if applicable) | Per Código do Trabalho rules |

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Skill | Interaction |
|---|---|
| portugal-bookkeeping | Payroll journal entries (account 63x), provisions for holiday/Christmas subsidies |
| portugal-einvoice | No direct interaction (e-invoicing is B2B; payslips are separate) |
| payroll-workflow-base | General payroll processing workflow; Portugal-specific overrides in this skill |

### Portugal-Specific Payroll Considerations

- **14 payments**: Portugal mandates 14 salary payments per year. Budget for this when converting annual salary to monthly cost.
- **Duodécimos**: Employees may request holiday and Christmas subsidies paid in 12 equal monthly instalments (1/12 each month). Employer may also choose this method.
- **Autonomous regions**: Açores and Madeira have slightly higher minimum wages and potentially different IRS withholding tables.
- **IRS withholding tables**: Updated annually by Despacho. Always use current-year tables. The 2026 tables apply retroactively from 1 January 2026.
- **Meal allowance**: Extremely common benefit. The exempt portion (EUR 6.00 cash / EUR 10.20 card) is NOT subject to SS or IRS. Any excess IS subject.
- **Trabalho suplementar (overtime)**: Subject to both SS contributions and IRS withholding at the normal rate.
