# NZ Provisional Tax

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Quick reference field table**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | New Zealand |
| Tax | Provisional income tax |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Act 2007 (ITA 2007), Part RC |
| Supporting legislation | Tax Administration Act 1994 (TAA 1994), ss 120A-120Q (UOMI) |
| Authority | Inland Revenue (IR / Te Tari Taake) |
| Portal | myIR (myir.ird.govt.nz) |
| Currency | NZD only |
| Threshold | RIT (residual income tax) must exceed $5,000 to trigger obligation |
| Default method | Standard option: previous-year RIT + 5% (105%) if filed by the instalment; otherwise two-years-ago RIT + 10% (110%) until recalculated |
| Alternative methods | Estimation method, AIM (Accounting Income Method), and ratio option where available |
| Standard balance date | 31 March |
| Standard dates | 28 August, 15 January, and 7 May for standard/estimation; next working day if a date falls on a weekend or public holiday |
| 6-monthly GST dates | Usually two instalments for a 31 March balance date: 28 October and 7 May |

**Standard instalment schedule (31 March balance date)**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/paying-your-provisional-tax/payment-dates-for-provisional-tax)_

| Instalment | Due date | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 28 August | 1/3 of standard-option amount (105% or 110%, as applicable) |
| 2nd | 15 January | 1/3 of standard-option amount (105% or 110%, as applicable) |
| 3rd | 7 May | 1/3 of standard-option amount (105% or 110%, as applicable) |
| 6-monthly GST / qualifying two-instalment case | 28 October and 7 May | 1/2 of standard-option amount each |

**Conservative defaults**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/paying-your-provisional-tax/payment-dates-for-provisional-tax)_

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Method unclear | Use standard option and check 105% vs 110%, GST filing frequency, and UOMI exposure |
| RIT threshold borderline | If exactly $5,000, no provisional tax (must EXCEED $5,000) |
| Balance date non-standard | Use IR's due-date calculator / provisional tax calendar; dates differ for non-31 March balance dates |
| Tax agent EOT / 6-monthly GST | May change to two instalments (commonly 28 October and 7 May) -- confirm in myIR or the IR calendar |
| First year with no prior RIT | No compulsory provisional tax from prior-year RIT; voluntary payments may be sensible for cash flow |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- **Minimum viable** — previous-year RIT, whether that return has been filed by the instalment date, any two-years-ago RIT fallback, balance date, GST filing frequency, and chosen method (standard option, estimation, AIM, or ratio).  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_
- **Recommended** — balance date, tax agent status (EOT), GST registration status, current year income trend.
- **Ideal** — complete prior year tax return, IR assessment, myIR statement, current year P&L if estimating.
- **Refusal policy if minimum is missing** — HARD STOP. Without prior-year RIT and filing-status timing, the standard option cannot be computed. If the previous-year return is not filed by the relevant instalment, two-years-ago RIT may be needed for the 110% fallback. If estimating, current-year projections are needed.  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-NZ-PT-1 -- Pooling arrangements** — Trigger: client uses provisional tax pooling. Message: "Tax pooling arrangements have specific rules outside this skill."  _(R-NZ-PT-1)_
- **R-NZ-PT-2 -- Multi-entity structures** — Trigger: complex multi-entity group. Message: "Multi-entity provisional tax allocation is outside this skill."  _(R-NZ-PT-2)_
- **R-NZ-PT-3 -- Non-resident provisional tax** — Trigger: non-resident client. Message: "Non-resident provisional tax is outside this skill."  _(R-NZ-PT-3)_

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions. When a debit matches a pattern below, classify it as a provisional tax payment.

### 3.1 Inland Revenue provisional tax debits

**Inland Revenue provisional tax debits**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IRD, INLAND REVENUE, IR PAYMENT | Provisional tax payment | Match with Aug/Jan/May timing |
| PROVISIONAL TAX, PROV TAX | Provisional tax payment | Explicit description |
| MYIR PAYMENT | Provisional tax payment | Online payment via myIR |
| TERMINAL TAX | NOT provisional tax | Year-end balance -- flag separately |

### 3.2 Timing-based identification

**Timing-based identification**

| Debit date range | Likely instalment | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 20 August -- 5 September | 1st instalment (28 Aug) | High if IR payee |
| 8 January -- 20 January | 2nd instalment (15 Jan) | High |
| 1 May -- 14 May | 3rd instalment (7 May) | High |
| January -- February (following year) | Terminal tax | Flag separately |

### 3.3 Related but NOT provisional tax

**Related but NOT provisional tax**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GST, GOODS AND SERVICES TAX | EXCLUDE | GST payment |
| ACC LEVY | EXCLUDE | Accident Compensation levy |
| STUDENT LOAN | EXCLUDE | Student loan repayment |
| KIWISAVER | EXCLUDE | Retirement savings |
| CHILD SUPPORT, IR CHILD | EXCLUDE | Child support via IR |
| PENALTIES AND INTEREST IR | EXCLUDE | Penalty/interest charge |
| TERMINAL TAX | Flag separately | Year-end balance, not provisional |

### 3.4 Tax agent EOT identification

- **Tax agent EOT identification** — If the client uses a tax agent with extension of time, or is registered for GST and files 6-monthly, instalment dates can shift. Common two-instalment pattern for a 31 March balance date: 28 October and 7 May, each 50% of the standard-option amount. Confirm in myIR or IR's provisional tax calendar.  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/paying-your-provisional-tax/payment-dates-for-provisional-tax)_

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Standard uplift, three instalments

**Example 1 instalment table**

| Instalment | Due date | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 28 August | $5,250 |
| 2nd | 15 January | $5,250 |
| 3rd | 7 May | $5,250 |
| **Total** |  | **$15,750** |

**Input:** Prior year RIT = $15,000. Standard uplift. 31 March balance date.

(Calculation: $15,000 x 105% = $15,750. Each instalment = $15,750 / 3 = $5,250.)

### Example 2 -- Below threshold

**Input:** Prior year RIT = $4,800.

**Output:** RIT does not exceed $5,000. No provisional tax required. Client pays terminal tax only.

### Example 3 -- Estimation method

**Input:** Prior year RIT = $25,000. Estimated current year RIT = $12,000.

**Output:** Standard option at 105% would require $26,250 if the previous-year return was filed by the instalment date. Estimation method: pay $12,000 / 3 = $4,000 per instalment. Warning: if actual RIT > $12,000, UOMI applies from instalment dates.

### Example 4 -- Tax agent EOT (two instalments)

**Example 4 instalment table**

| Instalment | Due date | Amount |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 28 October | $26,250 |
| 2nd | 7 May | $26,250 |

**Input:** Prior year RIT = $50,000. Tax agent with EOT.

(Calculation: $50,000 x 105% = $52,500. Two instalments of $26,250.)

### Example 5 -- Bank statement classification

**Input line:** `28.08.2025 ; IRD PROVISIONAL TAX ; DEBIT ; -5,250.00 ; NZD`

**Classification:** Provisional tax, 1st instalment 2025/26. Tax payment -- not a deductible expense.

## Section 5 -- Computation rules

### 5.1 RIT threshold

- **RIT threshold formula** — RIT = income_tax_assessed - PAYE_credits - RWT_credits - other_withholding if RIT > 5,000: provisional tax required if RIT <= 5,000: no provisional tax (terminal tax only)
- **First-year exemption** — no provisional tax in the first year of earning income giving rise to RIT.

### 5.2 Standard uplift method

- **Standard option formula** — provisional_tax = prior_year_RIT x 105% each_instalment = provisional_tax / number_of_instalments (3 standard, 2 with EOT)  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_
- **Safe harbour** — if standard-option instalments are paid on time and in full, UOMI exposure is reduced. Do not state there is blanket immunity: late or short payments can attract interest, and if actual RIT is $60,000 or more, UOMI can apply from the day after the final instalment on the difference between actual RIT and provisional tax paid.  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/interest-on-overpayments-and-underpayments)_

### 5.3 Estimation method

- **Estimation method formula** — provisional_tax = estimated_current_year_RIT each_instalment = provisional_tax / number_of_instalments
- **Risk** — UOMI is calculated by comparing provisional tax paid with actual RIT. Under estimation, underpayments can be charged from each instalment date; the client can re-estimate at an instalment date.  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/interest-on-overpayments-and-underpayments)_

### 5.4 AIM method

- **AIM method** — Tax calculated each period based on actual accounting income via AIM-capable software. AIM aligns with GST return periods; no UOMI is charged or paid if AIM statements and payments are correct and on time. Requires gross income under $5,000,000.  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_

### 5.5 Terminal tax

- **Terminal tax formula** — terminal_tax = actual_RIT - provisional_tax_paid
- **Terminal tax due date** — Due 7 February (without EOT) or 7 April (with EOT).

## Section 6 -- Penalties and interest

### 6.1 Use of Money Interest (UOMI)

**UOMI rate table**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/interest-on-overpayments-and-underpayments)_

| Effective from | IR charges on underpayments | IR pays on overpayments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16 January 2026 | 8.97% | 2.25% |
| 8 May 2025 | 9.89% | 3.27% |
| 16 January 2025 | 10.88% | 4.30% |

### 6.2 UOMI exposure by method

**UOMI exposure by method**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/managing-my-tax/penalties-and-interest/interest-on-overpayments-and-underpayments)_

| Method | UOMI exposure |
| --- | --- |
| Standard option, actual RIT under $60,000, required instalments paid full/on time | Generally no UOMI before terminal-tax timing |
| Standard option, actual RIT $60,000 or more | UOMI can apply from the day after the final instalment on the difference between actual RIT and provisional tax paid |
| Estimation | UOMI can apply from each instalment date if the estimate is too low |
| AIM (correct and on time) | No UOMI charged or paid |
| Ratio option (paid on time) | No UOMI charged or paid on provisional tax |

### 6.3 Late payment penalties

**Late payment penalties**

| Offence | Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Late payment | 1% initial + 4% if still unpaid after 7 days |
| Late IR3 filing | $250 (may increase) |
| Shortfall from deliberate understatement | 20-150% |

## Section 7 -- Method selection guidance

**Method selection guidance table**  _(https://www.ird.govt.nz/income-tax/provisional-tax/provisional-tax-options/standard-option)_

| Situation | Recommended method | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Income stable or growing | Standard option | Predictable uplift; check 105% vs 110%, the $60,000 RIT rule, and due-date timing |
| Income dropping significantly | Estimation | Lower cash outflow, but UOMI and shortfall-penalty risk if too low |
| Irregular/seasonal income | AIM or ratio option | Pay closer to actual trading pattern; confirm eligibility and software/GST setup |
| First year of business | No compulsory provisional tax from prior-year RIT | Voluntary payments accepted; plan for terminal tax cash flow |

Flag estimation method for reviewer whenever recommended.

## Section 8 -- Edge cases

No provisional tax obligation. Terminal tax due 7 February following year-end. May voluntarily pay to avoid large lump sum.

Standard option at 105% = $31,500 but expected RIT = $10,000. Use estimation method ($10,000/3 per instalment). UOMI risk if actual exceeds estimate.

RIT = total tax minus PAYE credits. If RIT > $5,000, provisional tax on RIT amount.

Instalment dates shift. 30 September balance date: instalments 28 February, 15 July, 7 November.

No provisional tax. Must EXCEED $5,000.

First-year freelancer may make voluntary payments. UOMI overpayment interest may apply.

The 7 May instalment falls AFTER the 31 March year-end. This is correct by design.

## Section 9 -- Self-checks

Before delivering output, verify:

- [ ] RIT threshold ($5,000) confirmed -- must exceed, not equal

- [ ] Uplift factor is 105% or 110% as applicable
- [ ] Correct number of instalments (3 standard, 2 with EOT)
- [ ] All instalment dates correct for the balance date
- [ ] UOMI exposure noted for estimation method
- [ ] Safe harbour benefit noted for standard uplift
- [ ] First-year exemption checked
- [ ] Terminal tax due date included
- [ ] Output labelled as estimated until NZ CA confirms

**Input:** Prior year RIT = $5,000.
**Expected:** No provisional tax (must exceed $5,000).

### Test 7 -- Mixed PAYE and SE

**Input:** PAYE salary $60,000. SE $20,000. RIT = $6,000.
**Expected:** Provisional tax on $6,000 RIT. Uplift: $6,300 / 3 = $2,100.

## Section 10 -- Test suite

## Prohibitions

- NEVER require provisional tax when prior year RIT is $5,000 or less
- NEVER state that standard-option payments eliminate all UOMI without checking late/short payments, terminal-tax timing, and the $60,000 actual RIT rule
- NEVER recommend estimation method without flagging UOMI risk
- NEVER apply 105% blindly when filing status requires the 110% two-years-ago RIT fallback
- NEVER confuse RIT with total income tax -- RIT is after deducting PAYE and other credits
- NEVER apply provisional tax in the first year of earning SE income (unless voluntary)
- NEVER ignore the 3rd instalment date falling after year-end
- NEVER present calculations as definitive -- direct to IR or NZ CA
