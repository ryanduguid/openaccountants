## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

Maryland starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11. This is entered on Form 502, Line 1.

### Additions to income

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Out-of-state bond interest | Interest on bonds of other states | Md. Tax–General § 10-204 |
| Bonus depreciation add-back | Maryland decouples from IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation | Md. Tax–General § 10-210.1 |
| Other IRC decoupling items | Maryland may decouple from certain federal provisions — verify annually | Md. Tax–General § 10-107 |

### Subtractions from income

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. government interest | Interest on U.S. obligations | Md. Tax–General § 10-207(a) |
| Social Security benefits | Maryland fully exempts Social Security from state tax | Md. Tax–General § 10-207(q) |
| Pension exclusion | Up to $39,500 (2025) for qualifying taxpayers age 65+ or permanently disabled | Md. Tax–General § 10-209 |
| Military pay | Various exclusions for active-duty and reserve service | Md. Tax–General § 10-207 |
| Child/dependent care expenses | Subtraction based on federal credit amount | Md. Tax–General § 10-207 |
| Two-income subtraction (MFJ) | Up to $1,200 for two-earner married couples | Md. Tax–General § 10-207(m) |

### Resulting computation

Federal AGI + additions − subtractions = Maryland AGI → minus standard or itemized deduction → minus personal exemptions = Maryland taxable net income → apply state bracket rates → apply county rate → sum = total Maryland income tax.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe $500 or more in combined state and county tax.

| Voucher | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Use Form 502D for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance
Maryland follows federal treatment — the deduction reduces federal AGI and flows through.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))
Maryland follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce federal AGI and flow through.

### Home office deduction
Maryland follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C, included in federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)
Maryland does **not** allow the federal QBI deduction because Maryland starts from federal AGI (before the QBI deduction). The QBI deduction does not affect Maryland taxable income.

### County tax on self-employment income
The county piggyback tax applies to Maryland taxable income, which includes self-employment income. The county is determined by the taxpayer's residence as of the last day of the tax year (December 31).
