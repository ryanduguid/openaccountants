## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | France |
| Taxes covered | IR on rental income, prélèvements sociaux |
| Currency | EUR only |
| Tax year | Calendar year |
| Key forms | 2042 (case 4BE), 2044, 2044-SPE, 2042-C-PRO, 2031, 2033, 2072 |
| Primary legislation | art. 14–33 quater CGI (fonciers), art. 35-I-5° bis CGI (LMNP), art. 155-IV CGI (LMP), art. 8 CGI (SCI) |

---

## Section 2 — Fundamental Distinction

| Type of rental | Tax regime | Income category |
|---|---|---|
| Bare / unfurnished (location nue) | Revenus fonciers | Revenus fonciers (micro or réel) |
| Furnished non-professional (LMNP) | **BIC** | LMNP (micro-BIC or réel) |
| Furnished professional (LMP) | **BIC** | LMP (réel obligatory) |
| SCI at IR | Revenus fonciers | Fiscal transparency |
| SCI at IS | IS | **Out of scope** — see business accounting skill |

**Classic error:** declaring furnished rental as revenus fonciers. Furnished = BIC. The tax consequences are very different (amortisation possible under réel).

---

## Section 3 — Bare Rental (Location Nue) — Revenus Fonciers

### 3.1 Micro-foncier (simplified regime)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Condition | Gross rental income ≤ EUR 15,000 |
| Abattement | 30% automatic |
| 2042 box | 4BE |
| Exclusions | SCI, monuments historiques, Pinel, Borloo, Malraux |

**Advantage:** simplicity, no bookkeeping required.
**Disadvantage:** no déficit possible. If actual charges > 30%, you overpay.

### 3.2 Régime réel

Obligatory above EUR 15,000 gross, or on irrevocable 3-year option.

**Deductible charges:**

| Charge | Deductible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage interest (intérêts d'emprunt) | Yes — foncier income only | Never against global income |
| Maintenance / repair works (travaux d'entretien) | Yes | Not construction, not extension |
| Improvement works (travaux d'amélioration) | Yes | |
| Taxe foncière | Yes | Exclude TEOM (recoverable from tenant) |
| Insurance premiums (PNO, GLI) | Yes | |
| Management fees (agency, syndic non-recoverable) | Yes | |
| Provisions for co-ownership charges | Yes | |

**Construction / extension / reconstruction works are NOT deductible** — they only increase the acquisition cost for future capital gains computation.

### 3.3 Déficit foncier (rental loss)

When charges exceed receipts:

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Imputable on global income | Up to **EUR 10,700**/year |
| Energy renovation exception | Up to EUR 21,400 (temporary device) |
| Excess beyond cap | Reportable on rental income for **10 years** |
| Mortgage interest | **NEVER** imputable on global income — only on rental income |

**Optimisation strategy:** concentrate major works in one year to maximise the global income deduction.

**Critical constraint:** do not sell the property within **3 years** after imputing a déficit on global income — otherwise the déficit is clawed back.

---

## Section 4 — Furnished Rental: LMNP (Location Meublée Non Professionnelle)

### 4.1 Micro-BIC regime

**Post loi Le Meur reform (Nov 2024), applicable revenus 2025** — the key distinction is now **classified vs unclassified tourism**.

| Type of furnished rental | Revenue ceiling | Abattement |
|---|---|---|
| Long-term furnished (LMNP longue durée) | EUR 77,700 | 50% |
| Classified furnished tourism (meublé de tourisme classé) | EUR 77,700 | 50% |
| **Unclassified furnished tourism** | **EUR 15,000** | **30%** |

Above the ceilings: régime réel is obligatory.

**2042-C-PRO boxes:** 5ND (long-term / unclassified), 5NG (classified tourism).

### 4.2 Régime réel LMNP

**Principle:** BIC result = receipts − charges − **amortisation**.

**Amortisation schedules:**

| Asset | Rate | Duration |
|---|---|---|
| Building (excluding land) | 2–3%/year | 25–40 years |
| Land | Non-amortisable | — |
| Furniture / equipment | 10–20%/year | 5–10 years |
| Major works | Per useful life | Variable |

**Fiscal result** is often nil or negative thanks to amortisation → no IR on rents for years.

**LMNP deficit:** NOT imputable on global income (unlike LMP). Reportable on furnished BIC income for **10 years**.

### 4.3 Prélèvements sociaux on LMNP

LMNP is classified as "revenus du patrimoine" (L. 136-6 CSS) → PS rate **18.6% from 2025 income** (LFSS 2026).

---

## Section 5 — LMP (Location Meublée Professionnelle)

### Conditions (cumulative)

1. Furnished rental receipts > **EUR 23,000** per year
2. **AND** furnished rental receipts > 50% of total professional income of the household (salaries + BNC + BIC + director compensation)

### Consequences of LMP status

| Feature | LMP | LMNP |
|---|---|---|
| Deficit imputation | On global income | Only on furnished BIC (10-year report) |
| Capital gains | Professional regime (exemption possible after 5 yrs under revenue conditions) | Private capital gains regime |
| Social contributions | TNS contributions on profit (SSI) — significant | PS only |
| IFI | Potentially exempt as professional asset | Taxable |

**Involuntary reclassification trap:** a drop in professional income (unemployment, retirement) can trigger LMP status despite unchanged rents. Monitor annually.

---

## Section 6 — SCI à l'IR (Real Estate Company at Income Tax)

**Default regime:** fiscal transparency. Income and charges flow directly to each partner's personal tax return pro rata to their shares.

| Feature | SCI at IR |
|---|---|
| Income category | Revenus fonciers (micro or réel, depending on total rental income of household) |
| Amortisation | **Not available** (unlike SCI at IS) |
| Capital gains on sale | Private real estate capital gains regime (exemption: 22 years IR / 30 years PS) |
| Typical use | Heritage transmission (démembrement, donation of shares), long-term bare rental |

**Meublé in SCI = risk of IS reclassification.** Furnished rental in an SCI exposes it to IS regime reclassification.

### SCI at IS (out of scope)

Allows amortisation but capital gains at sale are computed on net book value (after amortisation) → much heavier taxation. See business accounting skill.

## Section 7 — Forms Summary

| Regime | Form |
|---|---|
| Micro-foncier | 2042 case 4BE |
| Régime réel foncier | 2044 (or 2044 spéciale) |
| Micro-BIC LMNP | 2042-C-PRO (cases 5ND, 5NG, etc.) |
| Réel LMNP / LMP | 2031 + 2033 (liasse BIC) + 2042-C-PRO |
| SCI at IR | 2072 (SCI declaration) + report on 2044 (partners) |

---

## Section 8 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Furnished vs bare unclear | Classify as bare rental (revenus fonciers — no amortisation; conservative) |
| Regime unknown | Micro (simplest; check ceiling) |
| LMP vs LMNP unclear | LMNP (no TNS contributions) |
| Déficit foncier eligibility unclear | Do not impute on global income |
| Tourism classification unclear | Unclassified (30% abattement — most conservative) |

---

## Section 9 — Key Legal References

| Rule | Article |
|---|---|
| Revenus fonciers | art. 14 to 33 quater CGI |
| Déficit foncier | art. 156-I-3° CGI |
| LMNP | art. 35-I-5° bis CGI |
| LMP | art. 155-IV CGI |
| SCI transparency | art. 8 CGI |
| PS on LMNP (revenus du patrimoine) | art. L. 136-6 CSS |
