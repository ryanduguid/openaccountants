---

## Section 2 — PFU vs Barème: The Fundamental Arbitrage

### Default: PFU (Prélèvement Forfaitaire Unique / Flat Tax)

| Income type | IR component | PS component (revenus 2025) | Total PFU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dividends | 12.8% | 17.2% | **30.0%** |
| Interest (RCM) | 12.8% | 17.2% | **30.0%** |
| Capital gains on securities (PV mobilières) | 12.8% | 18.6% | **31.4%** |
| PEA gains (exit after 5 yr) | 0% (exempt) | 17.2% → 18.6% from 01/01/2026 | 17.2% or 18.6% |

### Differentiated PS rates (LFSS 2026)

LFSS 2026 (loi n° 2025-1403, art. 12) raised CSG from 9.2% to 10.6% (PS total: 17.2% → 18.6%), with **two different effective dates:**

| Category | Legal basis | PS on 2025 income | PS on 2026+ income | Effective PFU 2025 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Revenus du patrimoine** (capital gains, crypto, LMNP) | L. 136-6 CSS | **18.6%** | 18.6% | **31.4%** |
| **Produits de placement** (dividends, interest, PEA exit, PER capital) | L. 136-7 CSS | 17.2% | **18.6% from 01/01/2026** | 30.0% |
| **Unchanged** (AV, bare rental, SCPI, old PEL/CEL) | — | 17.2% | 17.2% | — |

### Option barème (progressive rates)

On election (global and irrevocable for the year), all capital income is taxed at the progressive IR schedule instead of 12.8%.

**Benefits of barème:**
- 40% abattement on dividends (art. 158-3° CGI)
- CSG déductible 6.8% in N+1 (economy = 6.8% × base × TMI in N+1)

**Quick guidance:**

| TMI | Recommendation | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| 0% or 11% | Barème | Low bracket + 40% dividend abattement + deductible CSG |
| 30% | Compute both | Depends on composition (dividends vs interest vs gains) |
| 41% or 45% | PFU | Flat 12.8% < 41%/45% bracket |

**Critical rule:** the barème option is **global** (all capital income for the year) and **irrevocable**. Never recommend without checking the full composition.

### Worked comparison — Single, TMI 30%, EUR 10,000 dividends (2025)

**Under PFU (dividends = produits de placement, PS 17.2%):**

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| IR: 10,000 × 12.8% | 1,280 |
| PS: 10,000 × 17.2% | 1,720 |
| **Total** | **3,000** |

**Under barème:**

| Component | Amount |
|---|---|
| Taxable base: 10,000 × (1 − 40%) | 6,000 |
| IR: 6,000 × 30% | 1,800 |
| PS: 10,000 × 17.2% | 1,720 |
| CSG déductible N+1: 10,000 × 6.8% × 30% | −204 |
| **Net total** | **3,316** |

→ PFU more favourable (EUR 3,000 < EUR 3,316) despite the 40% abattement.

---

## Section 3 — Types of Capital Income

### Dividends (case 2DC)

- Default PFU 30% (2025); rising to 31.4% from dividends received in 2026
- Option barème: 40% abattement + progressive IR + PS
- Foreign dividends: may carry withholding tax from source country — credit under tax treaty

### Interest / RCM (case 2TR)

- Bonds, crowdfunding interest, taxable savings accounts, term deposits
- PFU or barème on option. **No abattement** (unlike dividends)
- Crowdfunding immobilier: taxed as RCM, not rental income
- Livrets réglementés (Livret A, LDDS, LEP): **fully exempt** from IR and PS

### Capital gains on securities (case 3VG)

- Net gain on sale of shares, partnership interests, UCITS
- PFU or barème on option
- Holding period abattements: **only for shares acquired before 2018 AND barème option**
- Director retirement abattement: EUR 500,000 lump sum under strict conditions

---

## Section 4 — PEA (Plan d'Épargne en Actions)

### Contribution ceilings

| Plan | Ceiling |
|---|---|
| PEA classique | EUR 150,000 |
| PEA-PME | Combined PEA + PEA-PME ≤ EUR 225,000 |
| PEA jeune (adult child attached to household) | EUR 20,000 |

Ceilings apply to **contributions**, not plan value. A plan can exceed EUR 150,000 through gains.

### Tax treatment by plan age

| Plan age | Withdrawal effect | IR | PS |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 5 years | **Closure** of plan | PFU 12.8% (or barème) | 17.2% |
| ≥ 5 years | Free withdrawals, no closure | **Exempt** | 17.2% (→ 18.6% from 01/01/2026) |

After 5 years: **total IR exemption on gains**. Only PS are due at each withdrawal.

PS from 01/01/2026: **18.6%** on total gain at withdrawal (including gain accrued before 2026). PEA gains are "produits de placement" (L. 136-7 CSS).

**Eligible assets:** European equities (EU + EEA), UCITS with ≥75% European equities, eligible European ETFs. Non-eligible: US/Asian stocks, bonds, gold, crypto.

---

## Section 5 — Assurance-Vie (Life Insurance) — Taxation of Withdrawals (Rachats)

### Proportionality principle

A partial withdrawal does **not** extract only non-taxable capital. It extracts a **proportional** fraction of gains and capital.

```
taxable_gain_portion = (total_gains / total_contract_value) × withdrawal_amount
```

### Annual abattement after 8 years

| Situation | Annual abattement |
|---|---|
| Single, widowed, divorced | EUR 4,600 |
| Couple (joint filing) | EUR 9,200 |

Condition: 8 years of **contract** age (not contribution age). Renewable each calendar year.

### Tax rates by contribution date

**Contributions after 27 September 2017:**

| Situation | Rate |
|---|---|
| Contract < 8 years | PFU 30% (12.8% IR + 17.2% PS) |
| Contract ≥ 8 years, total contributions < EUR 150,000 | 24.7% (7.5% IR + 17.2% PS) after abattement |
| Contract ≥ 8 years, total contributions ≥ EUR 150,000 | 30% on fraction above EUR 150,000 of **net contributions** |

The EUR 150,000 threshold is assessed across **all AV contracts** of the household.

**Contributions before 27 September 2017:** Degressive PFL rates (35% / 15% / 7.5%) by contract age.

**PS rate on AV: 17.2% unchanged** (excluded from LFSS 2026 increase).

### Strategy: optimised withdrawals after 8 years

Spread withdrawals to stay within the annual abattement (EUR 9,200 couple). Example: need EUR 50,000 over 5 years → EUR 10,000/year optimises the abattement if gain portion ≤ abattement per withdrawal.

## Section 6 — RSU / AGA (Restricted Stock Units / Actions Gratuites)

### Two distinct taxable events

**1. Gain d'acquisition (at vesting)**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Nature | **Salary income** (traitements et salaires) |
| 2042 box | 1TT / 1UT |
| Tax | Progressive IR schedule (after 10% salary abattement on total salaries) |
| Social contributions | CSG/CRDS 9.7% + salarial contribution 10% (qualifying plans, within caps) |

**2. Plus-value de cession (at sale)**

| Attribute | Detail |
|---|---|
| Nature | PV mobilière |
| Tax | PFU **31.4%** for disposals from 2025 (12.8% IR + 18.6% PS) or barème on option |
| Qualification | "Revenus du patrimoine" (L. 136-6 CSS) → PS 18.6% from 2025 |

**Classic trap:** treating the acquisition gain as a standard capital gain. It is first and foremost **salary** (barème), subject to CSG 9.7% and salarial contribution 10%. Only the subsequent appreciation (vesting value → sale price) is a capital gain.

**Strategy:** for massive vesting (> 1.5× annual salary), consider the **quotient pour revenus exceptionnels** (coefficient 4) to smooth across brackets. Useless if already at TMI 45%.

---

## Section 7 — BSPCE (Bons de Souscription de Parts de Créateur d'Entreprise)

**Key difference vs RSU:** no acquisition gain taxed as salary. The gain is only realised and taxed **at sale** of the underlying shares.

### Tax rate on disposal gain

| Tenure in the company at sale date | Total rate (2025 disposals) |
|---|---|
| **≥ 3 years** | **31.4%** (12.8% IR + 18.6% PS — PV mobilière) |
| **< 3 years** | **50%** (30% IR + 20% PS — specific salarial contribution) |

**Early departure penalty** (< 3 years) is severe. Factor into departure decisions.

### Issuing company eligibility

- SA or SAS incorporated in France
- Registered < 15 years
- Unlisted or listed on SME compartment
- Subject to IS
- Capital ≥ 25% held by natural persons
- No restructuring history (merger, demerger, takeover)

If conditions not met: requalification as salary → progressive IR + full social contributions.

---

## Section 8 — Stock-Options

| Plan period | Regime |
|---|---|
| Before 2012 | Favourable specific schedule (by holding period) |
| 2012–2016 | Salary (IR barème + specific social contributions) |
| After 2017 | Salary (barème) + salarial contribution 10% on qualifying plans |

**Excess discount** (rabais excédentaire): difference between market price at grant and exercise price, above 5% → taxed as salary at exercise.

Always consult the plan to determine the applicable regime.

---

## Section 9 — PEE / PERCO / Employee Savings

### PEE (Plan d'Épargne Entreprise)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Employer match (abondement) | IR-exempt + PS-exempt within caps |
| Match cap | ~EUR 3,709 per beneficiary (8% PASS — verify annually) |
| Lock-up | 5 years (early exit for marriage, 3rd child birth, home purchase, job loss, etc.) |
| Exit after 5 years | **IR-exempt**, only PS 17.2% on gains |

### PERCO / PERO (Company PER)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Exit | At retirement — annuity or lump sum |
| Tax at exit | Same as individual PER (contributions at barème, gains at PFU) |
| Match cap | ~EUR 7,418 (distinct from PEE cap) |

### Priority rule

| Priority | Envelope | Why |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | PEE + employer match | Match = 50–300% instant return — unbeatable |
| 2nd | PERCO/PERO + employer match | Same logic, retirement lock |
| 3rd | Individual PER | Only TMI deduction, no match |

**Golden rule:** never contribute to an individual PER before saturating the employer match on PEE + PERCO. The match is free money.

---

## Section 10 — PER Sortie en Capital (Exit Taxation)

When exiting an individual PER as a lump sum:

| Component | Tax treatment |
|---|---|
| **Contributions (previously deducted)** | Progressive IR schedule (barème) — treated as income |
| **Investment gains** | PFU: 12.8% IR + PS (17.2% before 01/01/2026; 18.6% from 01/01/2026) |

PER gains are "produits de placement" (L. 136-7 CSS).

**Trap:** a lump-sum exit on contributions at TMI 45% is nearly neutral — same tax as a normal income year. Fractionate the exit over multiple years if possible.

---

## Section 11 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| PFU vs barème unclear | Apply PFU (simpler, no global commitment) |
| RSU gain classification unclear | Treat as salary (acquisition gain) |
| BSPCE tenure unclear | Assume < 3 years (50% rate — conservative) |
| PEA age unclear | Assume < 5 years (taxable) |
| AV abattement eligibility unclear | No abattement applied |
| PS rate unclear for 2025 income | Apply 18.6% for PV mobilières, 17.2% for dividends/interest |

---
