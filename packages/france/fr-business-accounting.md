## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | France |
| Scope | Business accounting (IS/IR entities), TVA, invoicing |
| Currency | EUR only |
| Accounting framework | Plan Comptable Général (PCG) |
| Tax authority | DGFiP |
| Key legislation | CGI (art. 38-39, 219, 293 B, 242 nonies A), Code de Commerce |

---

## Section 2 — VAT (TVA) Regimes and Rates

### Standard rates (2025)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 20% (taux normal) | Most goods and services |
| 10% (taux intermédiaire) | Restaurants, certain renovation works, public transport |
| 5.5% (taux réduit) | Food staples, books, energy, accessibility works |
| 2.1% (taux super-réduit) | Press, certain medicines, live performances |

### TVA regimes

| Regime | Condition | Declaration |
|---|---|---|
| Franchise en base (art. 293 B CGI) | Services CA ≤ EUR 36,800 (tolerance EUR 39,100); Sales CA ≤ EUR 91,900 (tolerance EUR 101,000) | No TVA collected or deducted. Mandatory mention: "TVA non applicable, art. 293 B du CGI" |
| Régime réel simplifié | CA < EUR 840,000 (goods) or EUR 254,000 (services) | CA12 annual + quarterly advances |
| Régime réel normal | Above simplified thresholds | CA3 monthly (or quarterly if TVA < EUR 4,000/year) |

### Intra-EU / international services

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Service purchased from EU provider | **Autoliquidation** (art. 283-2 CGI) — buyer self-assesses TVA |
| Service sold to EU business (B2B) | Reverse charge — invoice without TVA, mention "Autoliquidation" |
| Service sold to EU consumer (B2C) | French TVA unless OSS threshold exceeded |
| Import of goods from outside EU | TVA at customs or autoliquidation (since 2022) |

---

## Section 3 — E-Invoicing Reform (Réforme Facturation Électronique 2026)

### Timeline

| Date | Obligation | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **1 September 2026** | **Reception** of e-invoices | All TVA-liable entities (including franchise en base) |
| **1 September 2026** | **Emission** of e-invoices | Grandes Entreprises (GE) and ETI |
| **1 September 2027** | **Emission** of e-invoices | PME and micro-entreprises |

### Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| PA (Plateforme Agréée) | Certified platform for transmitting/receiving e-invoices. Mandatory for all. |
| PPF (Portail Public de Facturation) | Since Oct 2024, **no longer handles emission/reception**. Only serves as central directory + e-reporting concentrator. |
| e-Reporting | Transmission of B2C, international, and payment data. Does **NOT** cover domestic B2B between TVA-liable entities (already transmitted via e-invoicing). |
| Formats | Factur-X (CII), UBL, CII — structured XML embedded in or alongside PDF |
| PEPPOL | European e-invoicing network — accepted delivery channel |

### New mandatory mentions (from 1 September 2026, B2B domestic invoices)

| Mention | Notes |
|---|---|
| Client SIREN | Required on all domestic B2B invoices |
| Transaction category | "Biens" / "Services" / "Mixte" — separate from line descriptions |

### E-reporting scope

| Transaction type | E-reporting required? |
|---|---|
| B2B domestic (both TVA-liable) | No — covered by e-invoicing |
| B2C | Yes |
| International (export, intra-EU) | Yes |
| Payment data | Yes (for TVA-on-payments regime) |

---

## Section 4 — Invoice Requirements (Mentions Obligatoires)

### Mandatory mentions on every invoice

| Mention | Legal basis |
|---|---|
| Invoice date | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Sequential invoice number (no gaps) | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Seller: name, address, SIREN/SIRET | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Buyer: name, address | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Buyer SIREN (B2B domestic, from Sept 2026) | Réforme 2026 |
| VAT identification numbers (seller + buyer for intra-EU) | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Description of goods/services | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Quantity | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Unit price (HT) | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| TVA rate(s) applied | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Total HT, TVA amount, Total TTC | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |
| Payment terms (due date) | Art. L441-9 Code de Commerce |
| Late payment penalties rate | Art. L441-10 Code de Commerce |
| Fixed recovery fee (EUR 40) | Art. D441-5 Code de Commerce |
| Early payment discount or "Escompte: néant" | Art. 242 nonies A CGI |

**If franchise en base:** "TVA non applicable, art. 293 B du CGI" instead of TVA amounts.

### Credit notes (avoirs)

Must reference the original invoice number and clearly state the reason for the credit.

### Numbering

Sequential, chronological, no gaps. Common format: annual reset (e.g., F-2025-001, F-2025-002… F-2026-001).

### Retention

Invoices must be retained for **10 years** (art. L123-22 Code de Commerce). Digital archival with integrity guarantees.

---

## Section 5 — Corporate Tax (Impôt sur les Sociétés — IS)

### Rates (2025)

| Bracket | Rate | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| First EUR 42,500 of profit | **15%** (taux réduit PME) | CA < EUR 10M, capital fully paid up, ≥75% held by individuals |
| Above EUR 42,500 | **25%** (taux normal) | |

**Short financial year:** the EUR 42,500 threshold is prorated: EUR 42,500 × (days / 365).

### IS is not deductible

IS itself (account 695) is **not deductible** from taxable profit (art. 39-1-4° CGI). It must be added back in the fiscal result.

### Non-deductible charges (common traps)

| Charge | Rule |
|---|---|
| Fines and penalties | Not deductible |
| Luxury expenses (chasse, yacht) | Not deductible |
| Personal expenses of shareholder | Not deductible — risk of "acte anormal de gestion" |
| IS itself | Not deductible |
| Excessive management fees | Excess not deductible |

### Deductibility conditions (art. 39-1 CGI)

All charges must satisfy four conditions:
1. Incurred in the interest of the business
2. Reflect normal management
3. Supported by documentation (invoices)
4. Result in a decrease of net assets

---

## Section 6 — Annual Closing (Clôture Annuelle) — Summary

### 12-step workflow

1. Collect all transactions for the financial year
2. Categorise expenses (vendor → PCG account)
3. Bank reconciliation
4. Inventory entries (amortisation, PCA/CCA, provisions)
5. IS calculation
6. Generate journal entries (`data/journal-entries.json`)
7. Generate financial statements (bilan, compte de résultat, balance)
8. Generate the FEC (Fichier des Écritures Comptables)
9. Prepare liasse fiscale (2033 for simplified, 2050 for normal)
10. Prepare 2065-SD (IS declaration)
11. Prepare PV d'approbation / déclaration de confidentialité
12. Generate PDFs

### FEC (Fichier des Écritures Comptables)

Mandatory file with **18 columns**, pipe-separated (`|`). Must include all journal entries for the financial year.

**Conformity checks:**
- Total debits = total credits (global balance)
- Each entry (EcritureNum) is balanced
- Sequential numbering (no gaps)
- Dates within the financial year
- No negative amounts
- PieceRef populated for every entry
- CompteNum consistent with PCG roots

**Non-compliant FEC → comptabilité non probante** (art. L. 192 LPF) → burden of proof shifts to the taxpayer.

---

## Section 7 — Shareholder Current Account (Compte Courant d'Associé — 455)

**High fiscal risk zone**, especially for SASU/EURL.

| Check | Rule |
|---|---|
| Pre-incorporation expenses | Must be assumed within 6 months of registration; annexed to statuts or PV |
| Home office (bureau à domicile) | Pro-rata of surface area; plan required; non-deductible: mortgage principal, personal utilities |
| Interest on current account | Deductible only up to TMPV BCE rate; capital must be fully paid up (art. 212 CGI) |
| Mixed-use expenses | Only professional portion deductible |
| Currency conversion | BCE rate per transaction or monthly average accepted |

---

## Section 8 — Fiscal Calendar (Key Deadlines)

| Deadline | Obligation |
|---|---|
| Monthly 19th–24th | CA3 (TVA mensuelle) |
| Quarterly | CA3 (TVA trimestrielle if < EUR 4,000/year) |
| May (2nd business day after 1 May) | CA12 annual TVA return |
| 15 March, 15 June, 15 September, 15 December | IS quarterly advances |
| Within 3 months of year-end + 1 month extension | Liasse fiscale + 2065-SD |
| Within 6 months of year-end | AGO (approbation des comptes) |
| 1 month after AGO | Dépôt au greffe |

Check the official calendar: `https://www.impots.gouv.fr/professionnel/calendrier-fiscal`

## Section 9 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| TVA regime unknown | Franchise en base (if CA permits) |
| Charge deductibility doubtful | Non-deductible (conservative) |
| Mixed-use proportion unclear | 0% professional (flag for reviewer) |
| IS rate applicable unclear | 25% (no PME reduced rate) |
| Immobilisation vs charge threshold | EUR 500 HT (capitalise above) |
