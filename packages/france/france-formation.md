## Section 8 -- Foreign Founder Considerations

---

## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-FR-F1 -- Ignoring social charges on président SAS.** "The président of a SAS is assimilé salarié and social charges (~80% of gross remuneration) apply even if the président is the sole shareholder. This is significantly higher than SARL gérant majoritaire TNS charges. Always model both structures before choosing."

**R-FR-F2 -- Capital of €1 without substance.** "While €1 capital is legal, it signals undercapitalisation to banks, clients, and creditors. Recommend at least €1,000--€5,000 for credibility."

**R-FR-F3 -- Missing annonce légale.** "Publication in a JAL is mandatory and must occur before filing with the Guichet unique. Omission will cause the filing to be rejected."

**R-FR-F4 -- Failing to appoint commissaire aux comptes.** "A CAC is mandatory when two of three thresholds are exceeded: total assets €5M, revenue €10M, 50 employees. SAS companies sometimes overlook this."

**R-FR-F5 -- Auto-entrepreneur trying to raise investment.** "The auto-entrepreneur regime does not support equity investment, multiple shareholders, or limited liability. Advise conversion to SAS/SARL if the client needs these features."
