- Payment data for domestic B2B transactions

E-reporting follows the same phased timeline as e-invoicing issuance.

## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### Architecture Overview

The French system uses a Y-model:

1. **Seller** → issues invoice via their PA (Plateforme Agréée)
2. **Seller's PA** → transmits invoice to **Buyer's PA** (interoperability required)
3. Both PAs → report invoice data and lifecycle statuses to the **PPF** (Portail Public de Facturation)
4. **PPF** → aggregates data for DGFiP tax reporting

The PPF no longer handles direct invoice exchange. It serves as: (a) a central business directory for routing, (b) a data concentrator for tax authorities, and (c) a free fall-back platform for businesses without a commercial PA.

### Platforms

| Platform | Role |
|---|---|
| PPF (Portail Public de Facturation) | Central directory, tax data aggregation, free fall-back |
| PA (Plateforme Agréée) | Certified private platform for invoice exchange; formerly PDP |
| Chorus Pro | Remains the reference platform for B2G invoicing from 2026 onward |

### Chorus Pro (B2G) Transmission

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| Web portal | Manual upload via portail.chorus-pro.gouv.fr |
| API (PISTE) | REST API via https://api.piste.gouv.fr/cpro/ with OAuth2 authentication |
| EDI | Structured data exchange for high-volume senders |
| Peppol | Via Peppol Access Point connected to Chorus Pro |

### Invoice Lifecycle Statuses

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| Deposée (Deposited) | Invoice submitted by seller to PA |
| Reçue (Received) | Invoice delivered to buyer's PA |
| Acceptée (Accepted) | Buyer accepts the invoice |
| Refusée (Rejected) | Buyer rejects the invoice (with reason) |
| Payée (Paid) | Buyer confirms full payment |
| En litige (Disputed) | Invoice under dispute |

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### Pre-Submission Validation

| Check | Description |
|---|---|
| Schema validation | XML must conform to Factur-X, UBL 2.1, or CII schema |
| SIREN/SIRET validation | Seller and buyer identifiers verified against INSEE database |
| VAT number format | Must follow French format: FR + 2 check digits + 9-digit SIREN |
| Mandatory field completeness | All required BT fields must be populated |
| Tax calculation consistency | Line totals must reconcile with summary totals |
| Profile conformance | Factur-X XML must match declared profile level |

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Missing buyer reference (BT-10) | Always populate -- mandatory in French context |
| Invalid SIRET | Verify against INSEE Sirene database |
| Tax calculation mismatch | Ensure line-level VAT sums match document-level totals |
| Unsupported Factur-X profile | Use at least Basic profile for B2B compliance |
| Missing legal mentions | Include required CGI mentions (auto-liquidation, TVA non applicable Art. 293B, etc.) |
| Duplicate invoice | Check invoice numbering is sequential and unique per tax year |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates (2025/2026)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 20% | Standard rate (taux normal) |
| 10% | Intermediate rate (taux intermédiaire) -- renovation, transport, restaurants |
| 5.5% | Reduced rate (taux réduit) -- essential food, books, energy |
| 2.1% | Super-reduced rate (taux particulier) -- newspapers, pharmaceuticals |
| 0% | Exempt / non-taxable (with legal mention required) |

### Rounding

- Compute VAT per line: `HT × rate`, round to 2 decimal places
- Document-level totals must equal sum of line-level amounts
- Standard arithmetic rounding (banker's rounding not required but accepted)
- Tolerance: document-level and sum-of-lines totals must match within EUR 0.01 per VAT rate group

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

- Each VAT rate must have a separate tax subtotal group (BG-23 in EN 16931)
- The invoice must clearly distinguish between taxable, exempt, and reverse-charge amounts
- Reverse charge (auto-liquidation) requires explicit mention and rate = 0% with appropriate category code

### Discount and Charge Handling

- Document-level allowances/charges (BG-20, BG-21) affect the total taxable base
- Line-level allowances (BG-27, BG-28) must be reflected in the line net amount
- Both must specify the applicable VAT category

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 6 years for tax purposes (Art. L102 B, Livre des Procédures Fiscales); 10 years for commercial purposes (Code de Commerce) |
| Format | Original electronic format (XML or PDF/A-3 with embedded XML) |
| Integrity | Tamper-proof storage with traceable access logs |
| Authenticity | Guaranteed by: qualified electronic signature, EDI with audit trail, or internal controls (piste d'audit fiable -- PAF) |
| Storage location | France or EU member state with reciprocal access agreement |
| Audit access | Full read access must be available to tax authorities on demand |
| PA obligation | Certified platforms must provide compliant archiving services |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| Failure to issue compliant e-invoice | EUR 50 per invoice | EUR 15,000 per calendar year |
| Failure to transmit e-reporting data (transaction/payment) | EUR 500 per missing transmission | EUR 15,000 per calendar year |
| Failure to designate a PA for receiving invoices | EUR 500 after 3-month formal notice; EUR 1,000 after each subsequent 3-month period | No annual cap |
| Issuing fraudulent invoices | 50% of invoice amount | EUR 375,000 |
| Total failure to issue any invoice | Up to EUR 375,000 (first offence); EUR 750,000 (repeat) | -- |
| PA platform non-compliance | EUR 15 per invoice (failure to transmit/receive) | EUR 45,000 per calendar year |
| PA failure to transmit e-reporting | EUR 750 per transmission | EUR 100,000 per calendar year |

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT Return Integration

- E-invoicing data transmitted to the PPF will progressively feed into pre-filled VAT returns (CA3 monthly/quarterly)
- The DGFiP aims to use aggregated e-invoicing + e-reporting data to pre-populate TVA declarations
- Domestic B2B: invoice data flows directly from PA → PPF → DGFiP VAT systems
- B2C and cross-border: e-reporting data supplements the invoice data for complete VAT return coverage
- Invoice lifecycle statuses (particularly "paid" status) enable future pre-filling of payment-related VAT fields

### Income Tax Integration

- For auto-entrepreneurs (micro-BIC / micro-BNC), e-invoicing data contributes to pre-filled revenue declarations
- Professional income from invoices issued via PA feeds into the BIC/BNC professional income return (2031/2035)

### Chorus Pro and Public Accounting

- B2G invoices in Chorus Pro integrate with public-sector accounting systems (Hélios for local government, Chorus for central government)
- Invoice lifecycle statuses in Chorus Pro directly affect cash flow planning and payment tracking for public contracts

### Cross-Border Considerations

- E-reporting obligations for intra-EU supplies require reporting of buyer VAT ID, invoice amount, and applicable exemption
- Import VAT (auto-liquidation since 1 January 2022 for all importers) is reported separately but related invoice data flows through e-reporting
