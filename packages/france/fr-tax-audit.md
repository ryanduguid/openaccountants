## Section 3 — The 8 Verification Axes

### Axis 1: FEC Examination (art. L. 47 A-I LPF)

**Mandatory checks on the FEC file:**

| Check | Consequence of failure |
|---|---|
| Format conformity (18 columns, pipe `\|` separator) | Comptabilité non probante |
| Global balance: total debits = total credits | Comptabilité non probante |
| Per-entry balance: each EcritureNum is balanced | Presumption of concealment |
| Sequential numbering (no gaps) | Presumption of concealment |
| Dates within the financial year | Fictitious entries |
| No negative amounts | Format violation |
| PieceRef populated for every entry | Missing supporting documents |
| CompteNum consistent with PCG roots | Irregular accounts |

**Non-compliant FEC → comptabilité non probante (art. L. 192 LPF):** burden of proof shifts to the taxpayer.

### Axis 2: Corporate Tax (IS) Control (art. 38–39 CGI)

| Checkpoint | Legal basis | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| IS add-back (account 695) | art. 39-1-4° CGI | IS is not deductible — verify it is added back |
| PME reduced rate eligibility | art. 219-I-b CGI | CA < EUR 10M, capital paid up, ≥75% held by individuals |
| Short year proration | art. 219-I-b CGI | EUR 42,500 × (days / 365) |
| Non-deductible charges | art. 39 CGI | Fines, luxury expenses, personal expenses |
| Acte anormal de gestion | Case law (CE) | Charges unrelated to business interest |

### Axis 3: Charge Deductibility (art. 39-1 CGI)

**Four cumulative conditions:**
1. Incurred in the interest of the business
2. Reflects normal management
3. Supported by invoices/documentation
4. Results in a decrease of net assets

**Systematic examination grid:**

| Account | Typical audit question |
|---|---|
| 604 (Subcontracting, APIs) | Exclusively professional use? Invoices in company name? |
| 6132 (Home office) | Justified proportion? Conforming to BOFiP? Convention exists? |
| 6135 (SaaS / hosting) | 100% professional? No personal consumption? |
| 6181 (Documentation) | Link with business activity? |
| 622 (Intermediaries) | Nature and supporting documents? |
| 6231 (Advertising) | Gifts = gratuities? Directories = advertising? |
| 627/6278 (Banking) | Consistent with bank statements? |
| 651 (Domain names) | All related to business activity? |
| 654 (Chargebacks) | Documented irrecoverability? |

### Axis 4: Shareholder Current Account 455 (art. 39-1-3° and 212 CGI)

**High fiscal risk**, especially SASU/EURL.

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| Pre-incorporation expenses | Assumed within 6 months? Annexed to statuts/PV? Professional character? |
| Home office | Justified surface proportion? Plan available? Non-deductible: mortgage principal |
| Interest on current account | No interest = OK. If interest paid: capped at TMPV BCE rate |
| Currency conversion | BCE rate acceptable; inspector may demand per-transaction rate |

### Axis 5: Revenue (art. 38-2 CGI)

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| Revenue completeness | Cross-check payment platforms (Stripe, PayPal) vs. accounting |
| Period cut-off | Revenue booked only for the financial year |
| Credit balance on 411 (Clients) | Abnormal — advance? Omitted revenue? |
| Asset disposals | Proper classification (account 775)? |
| Commissions / ancillary revenue | Nature? Foreign withholding tax? |

### Axis 6: TVA

**If franchise en base (art. 293 B CGI):**

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| Threshold monitoring | Services: EUR 36,800 (tolerance EUR 39,100). Annualise if short year |
| Invoice mention | "TVA non applicable, art. 293 B du CGI" |
| Asset disposals | Subject to TVA or exempt? |
| Intra-EU / extra-EU services | Autoliquidation (art. 283-2 CGI)? |

**If TVA collected:**

| Check | Detail |
|---|---|
| CA3/CA12 vs accounting concordance | |
| Deductible TVA documentation | |
| Pro-rata deduction if mixed activity | |

### Axis 7: Fixed Assets and Depreciation (art. 39-1-2° CGI)

## Section 4 — Penalty Schedule

### Interest on late payment (intérêts de retard — art. 1727 CGI)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Monthly rate | 0.20% |
| Annual rate | 2.40% |

## Section 5 — Risk Assessment Grid

### Aggravating factors

| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| SASU/EURL without auditor | Heightened scrutiny on personal charges |
| First financial year | Limited history, frequent errors |
| Revenue in foreign currency | Conversion rate risk |
| High 455 current account balance | Suspicion of patrimony confusion |
| Internet/SaaS activity | Territorial allocation difficulties |

### Mitigating factors

| Factor | Impact |
|---|---|
| Small size (CA < EUR 50k) | Lighter verification |
| Regular bookkeeping | Compliant FEC, balanced entries |
| First year in good faith | Tolerance for formal errors |
| No employees | No social risk |
| Franchise en base TVA | No collected-TVA risk |

---

## Section 6 — Common Adjustment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Personal expenses in account 455

**Assessment:** Reintegration of personal portion. Possible requalification as "disguised remuneration" → social contributions. If significant amounts: acte anormal de gestion.

### Scenario 2: Overstated home office

**Assessment:** Reintegration of excess (declared % − actual %) × charges. Surcharge 10% (good faith) or 40% (if recurring).

### Scenario 3: Pre-incorporation expenses without état des actes

**Assessment:** Full reintegration of pre-incorporation charges. Additional IS on the amount.

### Scenario 4: Omitted revenue (credit balance on 411)

**Assessment:** If inspector considers it undeclared revenue → added to fiscal result + IS + 40% surcharge if intentional.

### Scenario 5: Incorrect currency conversion

**Assessment:** Recalculation of all foreign-currency charges at correct BCE rate. IS on the difference.

---

## Section 7 — Statute of Limitations (Droit de Reprise)

| Tax | Standard period |
|---|---|
| IS / IR | 3 years (until 31 Dec of the 3rd year following the tax year) |
| TVA | 3 years |
| IFI | 6 years |
| All taxes (undisclosed activity / fraud) | **10 years** |

**Document retention recommendation:** minimum 6 years (recommended: 10 years to cover all scenarios).

---

## Section 8 — Voluntary Regularisation

If the taxpayer corrects before an audit:
- Late interest: 0.20%/month (still applies)
- **No surcharge** if regularisation is spontaneous and in good faith
- For significant cases (crypto, foreign income, unreported gains): consult an avocat fiscaliste for structured regularisation

---

## Section 9 — Audit Report Format

For each anomaly, the adjustment is formalised as a **chef de redressement** containing:

1. **Tax concerned** (IS / TVA / Other)
2. **Financial year**
3. **Legal basis** (CGI article / BOFiP reference)
4. **Nature** of the adjustment
5. **Factual finding**
6. **Legal foundation and case law**
7. **Amount** (base, additional tax, interest, surcharge, total)
8. **Risk level** (high / medium / low)
9. **Corrective recommendation**

---

## Section 10 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Charge deductibility doubtful | Flag as potentially non-deductible |
| Surcharge rate unclear | Assume 10% (good faith) |
| FEC gap found | Flag as potential concealment |
| Revenue source unclear | Include in taxable revenue |
