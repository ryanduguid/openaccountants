## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

No statutory hierarchy. Most appropriate method principle applies. In practice, CUP is preferred where available; TNMM is most commonly used.

### 3.4 Finance Act 2024 Presumption

From 2024, TP documentation is "enforceable" -- if the method used by the company in practice differs from the method documented, there is a presumption of indirect profit transfer that the taxpayer must rebut.

## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

France does not have general statutory safe harbour rules for transfer pricing.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Low-value intra-group services | No formal safe harbour; OECD simplified approach (5% cost-plus) accepted in practice |
| Interest rates | No safe harbour; market rate benchmarking required |
| Thin capitalisation | Separate rules under Article 212 CGI (debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5:1) |
| Small transactions | Transactions below EUR 100,000 per category need not be individually documented in Local File |
| General principle | France explicitly states it has no general safe harbour provisions |

### 8.1 Thin Capitalisation (Article 212 CGI)

While not a safe harbour per se, France's thin capitalisation rules provide a framework:
- Debt-to-equity ratio: 1.5:1
- Interest rate cap: related-party loan interest capped at market reference rate
- Interest coverage: net interest deduction limited to 25% of EBITDA (from 2019, ATAD transposition)

These interact with but are separate from TP analysis.
