## Section 2 — Full IR Computation Sequence

**Never skip a step. Each intermediate must be computed.**

```
1. Revenus bruts par catégorie
   ↓ abattements spécifiques (10% salaires, 10% pensions, 40% dividendes if barème…)
2. Revenus nets catégoriels
   ↓ somme
3. Revenu brut global (RBG)
   ↓ déductions (PER, pension alimentaire, CSG déductible N-1)
4. Revenu Net Imposable (RNI)
   ↓ ÷ nombre de parts
5. Quotient
   ↓ application du barème progressif
6. Impôt par part
   ↓ × nombre de parts
7. Impôt brut
   ↓ plafonnement du gain QF
8. Impôt après QF
   ↓ décote (if impôt < threshold)
9. Impôt après décote
   ↓ − réductions d'impôt (floor at 0)
10. Impôt après réductions
    ↓ − crédits d'impôt (refundable — can be negative)
11. Impôt net
    + Prélèvements sociaux (separate, on capital income)
    + CEHR (if RFR > thresholds)
    + CDHR (if effective rate < 20% floor)
    = Total tax liability
```

## Section 3 — Progressive Rate Table (Barème IR)

### 2025 Brackets (revenus 2025, déclaration 2026) — per part

| Revenu net imposable (EUR/part) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of bracket |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 11,600 | 0% | 0 |
| 11,601 – 29,579 | 11% | 1,977.69 |
| 29,580 – 84,577 | 30% | 18,477.09 |
| 84,578 – 181,917 | 41% | 58,386.49 |
| Above 181,917 | 45% | — |

*Tranches LFI 2026 (revenus 2025, indexation +0.9%). Source: art. 197 CGI.*

### Worked Example — Single, RNI = EUR 40,000, 1 part

| Bracket | Calculation | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 11,600 | 11,600 × 0% | 0 |
| 11,601 – 29,579 | 17,979 × 11% | 1,977.69 |
| 29,580 – 40,000 | 10,421 × 30% | 3,126.30 |
| **Total** | | **5,103.99** |

## Section 4 — Abattements (Standard Deductions) by Income Category

| Income type | 2042 box | Abattement | Min / Max | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Salaries (salaires) | 1AJ/1BJ | 10% | min EUR 509, max EUR 14,555 | Or opt for frais réels |
| Pensions / retirement | 1AS/1BS | 10% | min EUR 450, max EUR 4,446 per household | |
| **Unemployment (ARE)** | **1AP/1BP** | **None** | — | Common trap: never put in 1AJ |
| Dividends (option barème) | 2DC | 40% | — | Only under barème option |
| Dividends (PFU) | 2DC | None | — | |
| Micro-BNC | 5TE | 34% | min EUR 305, ceiling EUR 77,700 | |
| Micro-foncier (bare rental) | 4BE | 30% | ceiling EUR 15,000 | |
| Micro-BIC LMNP long-term | 5ND | 50% | ceiling EUR 77,700 | |
| Micro-BIC furnished tourism unclassified | 5ND | 30% | ceiling EUR 15,000 | Loi Le Meur |
| Micro-BIC furnished tourism classified | 5NG | 50% | ceiling EUR 77,700 | |

**Salary terminology trap:**

| Term | Where found | Value |
|---|---|---|
| Salaire brut | Pay slip — top | Before contributions |
| Salaire net | Pay slip — deposited amount | After contributions, before non-deductible CSG |
| **Salaire net imposable (1AJ)** | **Pay slip — dedicated line** | **Amount declared in box 1AJ** |
| RNI (after abattement) | Avis d'imposition | 1AJ × 0.9 (standard range) |

---

## Section 5 — Quotient Familial (Family Quotient)

### Parts de base (base shares)

| Situation | Base parts |
|---|---|
| Single, divorced, separated | 1 |
| Married / PACSed (joint filing) | 2 |
| Widowed without children | 1 |
| Widowed with child(ren) | 2 (+ child parts) |

### Majoration for children

| Child rank | Additional parts |
|---|---|
| 1st child | +0.5 |
| 2nd child | +0.5 |
| 3rd child and each subsequent | +1.0 each |

**Special cases:**
- Shared custody (résidence alternée): half the above values (0.25 / 0.25 / 0.5)
- Disabled child (carte CMI-invalidité): +0.5 additional part
- Single parent (parent isolé, case T): +0.5 on first child

### Examples

| Household | Total parts |
|---|---|
| Single, no children | 1 |
| Single, 1 child | 1.5 (or 2 if parent isolé) |
| Married, 0 children | 2 |
| Married, 2 children | 3 |
| Married, 3 children | 4 |

### Plafonnement du gain QF (QF capping)

**Critical mechanism often forgotten.** The tax benefit from supplementary half-parts (children) is capped.

**Algorithm:**

```
tax_with_all_parts     = normal calculation with all parts
tax_without_children   = calculation with base parts only (1 or 2)
actual_gain            = tax_without_children − tax_with_all_parts

cap_per_half_part      = EUR 1,807 (revenus 2025)
nb_supplementary_halves = (total_parts − base_parts) × 2
max_gain               = cap_per_half_part × nb_supplementary_halves

final_tax = tax_without_children − min(actual_gain, max_gain)
```

**Practical consequence:** above approximately EUR 90,000–100,000 RNI for a couple with 2 children, the QF benefit plateaus at EUR 3,614 (2 × EUR 1,807).

**Parent isolé (case T):** the half-part for single parents has its own higher cap (EUR 4,273 for the first child-related part). Widowed with children: cap EUR 4,273.

---

## Section 6 — Décote (Low-Income Smoothing)

Applied **after** QF plafonnement, **before** reductions/credits.

### Formulas (revenus 2025)

| Situation | Condition | Décote formula |
|---|---|---|
| Single | Impôt brut < EUR 1,982 | 897 − 0.4525 × impôt brut |
| Couple | Impôt brut < EUR 3,277 | 1,483 − 0.4525 × impôt brut |

**The décote cannot make the tax negative (floor at 0).**

### Effective marginal rate in the décote zone

In the décote zone, each additional euro of income:
- Increases tax at the bracket rate
- Reduces the décote by 0.4525 × that amount

Effective marginal rate ≈ bracket_rate × 1.4525. A household in the 11% bracket can face ~16% effective marginal rate in the décote zone.

---

## Section 7 — CEHR (Contribution Exceptionnelle sur les Hauts Revenus)

Base: **RFR** (revenu fiscal de référence), not RNI. Added on top of IR net. Art. 223 sexies CGI.

| Situation | 3% bracket | 4% bracket |
|---|---|---|
| Single | EUR 250,001 – 500,000 | > EUR 500,000 |
| Couple | EUR 500,001 – 1,000,000 | > EUR 1,000,000 |

Smoothing possible over the average of the 2 preceding years.

---

## Section 8 — CDHR (Contribution Différentielle sur les Hauts Revenus)

**Distinct from CEHR.** Imposes a **20% floor** on effective tax rate for high-RFR households. Art. 224 CGI, created by LFI 2025 (loi n° 2025-127), extended by LFI 2026 until deficit < 3% GDP.

| Situation | RFR threshold |
|---|---|
| Single, widowed, separated, divorced | > EUR 250,000 |
| Couple (married or PACSed, joint filing) | > EUR 500,000 |

**Mechanism:** if (IR + CEHR) / adjusted RFR < 20%, the CDHR tops up the difference.

**Automatic calculation** by the administration after filing. Advance of 95% due between 1–15 December via impots.gouv.fr PAS service.

**Typical profiles affected:** executives with large PFU dividends (effective IR ~12.8% while RFR > 250k), business angels with large capital gains, RSU/BSPCE vesting years.

---

## Section 9 — Prélèvement à la Source (PAS — Withholding at Source)

### Two mechanisms

| Mechanism | Income types | Collector |
|---|---|---|
| Retenue à la source (withholding) | Salaries, pensions, unemployment | Employer / pension fund / Pôle Emploi |
| Acompte contemporain (advance payment) | BIC, BNC, BA, rental income, received alimony | DGFiP via bank debit (monthly or quarterly) |

### Rate types

| Rate type | Description |
|---|---|
| Personalised (default) | Calculated by DGFiP from last filing |
| Individualised (couples) | Separate rates per spouse — same total, different split |
| Neutral (non-personalised) | Grid for single with no children — confidentiality option |

### Modulation

- **Downward:** allowed if estimated gap > 5%. Penalty 10% if gap > 10% and unjustified (art. 1729 G CGI).
- **Upward:** allowed without minimum threshold.
- **Life change:** marriage, PACS, birth, divorce, death — signal within **60 days** (art. 204 I CGI).

### Annual settlement

PAS is an **advance**, not final. Declaration in Apr-Jun N+1 leads to:
1. Definitive IR calculated on year N income
2. Compared with total withheld in N
3. **Balance due** (September N+1, spread if > EUR 300) or **refund** (July-August N+1)

### January advance for tax credits

DGFiP pays a **60% advance** mid-January based on N-2 expenses (emploi à domicile, garde d'enfant, dons, Pinel). Adjusted in summer N+1. Option to renounce in December if expense won't recur.

---

## Section 10 — Deductions, Reductions, and Credits

### Fundamental distinction

| Mechanism | Acts on | Refundable if excess? | Calculation step |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Déduction** | Taxable income (RNI) | N/A | Step 3 |
| **Réduction** | Tax due | No — floor at 0 | Step 9 |
| **Crédit** | Tax due | Yes — refunded | Step 10 |

A EUR 1,000 deduction at TMI 30% saves EUR 300. A EUR 1,000 credit saves EUR 1,000.

### Key deductions (act on RNI)

| Deduction | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PER (épargne retraite) | 10% of professional income, min EUR 4,710, max EUR 37,680 | Report unused caps 3 years; couple mutualisation |
| Pension alimentaire (child support) | Capped annually | Proof of need and actual payment required |
| CSG déductible | 6.8% of capital income CSG | Only if barème option on capital in N-1; zero under PFU |
| Frais réels (actual expenses) | Replaces 10% salary abattement | Must document every expense |

### Key reductions (floor at 0)

**Subject to the EUR 10,000 global cap (plafonnement des niches fiscales):**

| Device | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Pinel | Spread over 6/9/12 years | Last vintage 2024 — in extinction |
| FCPI / FIP | 18% – 25% of investment | Separate investment ceiling |
| Denormandie | Similar to Pinel, older housing | Targeted to degraded town centres |

**Outside the EUR 10,000 cap:**

| Device | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Dons associations (charitable gifts) | 66% standard; 75% for poverty relief (up to EUR 1,000/year) | Excess above 20% of taxable income reportable 5 years |
| Cotisations syndicales (union dues) | 66% | Cap: 1% of gross salary |
| Girardin industriel (overseas) | Variable | Specific conditions |

### Key credits (refundable)

| Credit | Rate | Ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Emploi à domicile (home help) | 50% | EUR 12,000/year (max credit EUR 6,000); +EUR 1,500 per child or person 65+ (max EUR 15,000) | CESU+ instant advance available since 2022 |
| Garde d'enfant hors domicile (childcare) | 50% | EUR 3,500/child (max credit EUR 1,750/child) | Child under 6 at 1 January |

### Global cap on tax incentives (plafonnement des niches fiscales)

**EUR 10,000 per year** (EUR 18,000 for specific overseas investments).

Devices "inside the cap" (Pinel, FCPI, etc.) are summed. If total exceeds EUR 10,000, the excess is **lost** (not reportable).

Devices "outside the cap" (charitable gifts, home help credit) are unlimited by this mechanism.

## Section 11 — Special Cases

### Revenus exceptionnels — Quotient mechanism

Smoothing for one-off income (RSU vesting, departure indemnity, exceptional bonus) that would artificially push through multiple brackets.

**Formula (coefficient = 4):**

```
supplementary_tax = [IR(ordinary_income + exceptional/4) − IR(ordinary_income)] × 4
```

**Conditions:**
- Income exceeds the average of taxable income over the 3 preceding years
- Exceptional, non-recurring character
- Explicit request on the declaration

**Useless if** the household is already at TMI 45% — the marginal rate doesn't change with division.

### Non-residents

- Taxed only on **French-source income** (art. 164 A CGI)
- Minimum rate: 20% on fraction ≤ EUR 27,519 and 30% above (revenus 2025)
- No quotient familial beyond 2 parts; no décote
- Tax treaty analysis required — out of scope for complex cases

### PUMA — Cotisation subsidiaire maladie

Affects individuals with low professional income but significant capital income.

| Condition | Threshold (2025) |
|---|---|
| Professional income below | ~20% PASS ≈ EUR 9,420 |
| Capital income above | ~50% PASS ≈ EUR 23,550 |

Rate: **6.5%** on (capital income − 50% PASS). Collected by URSSAF, not DGFiP. Non-deductible from IR.

**Trap:** commonly forgotten in FIRE / early-retirement simulations — adds ~6.5% on top of PS.

### Year of marriage / PACS

Joint filing for the entire year (since 2011), or separate filing on option. Compute both to find more favourable.

### Year of divorce / separation

Separate filing for the full year. Case T (parent isolé) available for the parent with sole custody.

### Year of spouse's death

Joint filing from 1 January to date of death. Separate filing for the surviving spouse for the remainder.

### Statute of limitations (droit de reprise)

| Tax | Standard period |
|---|---|
| IR | 3 years |
| IFI | 6 years |
| All taxes (undisclosed activity / fraud) | 10 years |

**Document retention:** minimum 6 years (recommended: 10 years).

---

## Section 12 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Filing status unknown | Single, 1 part |
| Number of children unknown | 0 |
| Regime unknown | Barème progressif (no PFU option) |
| Credit eligibility unclear | No credit applied |
| PAS rate unknown | Standard personalised rate |
| ARE vs salary unclear | Classify as ARE (no 10% abattement — conservative) |
