## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | France |
| Tax | IR + prélèvements sociaux on crypto capital gains |
| Currency | EUR only |
| Tax year | Calendar year |
| Primary legislation | art. 150 VH bis CGI |
| Key forms | 2086 (per-disposal detail), 2042-C (cases 3AN/3BN) |
| Exemption threshold | EUR 305 annual gross disposals |
| Default rate | PFU **31.4%** (12.8% IR + 18.6% PS) for 2025 income |

---

## Section 2 — Scope: Occasional vs Professional

This skill covers the **occasional** regime for individuals. If the activity is habitual/professional, it is reclassified as **BIC** with TNS social contributions.

**Indicators of professional activity:**
- High transaction volume
- Near-daily frequency
- Use of professional tools (bots, API, automated arbitrage)
- Crypto income constitutes primary household revenue

---

## Section 3 — Taxable Events (Fait Générateur)

| Operation | Taxable? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Buy crypto with EUR/USD | No | Acquisition only |
| **Sell crypto for EUR/USD** | **Yes** | Disposal to fiat |
| **Pay with crypto (goods/services)** | **Yes** | Disguised disposal |
| Crypto-to-crypto exchange (BTC → ETH) | **No** | Deferral (sursis, art. 150 VH bis-I-2) |
| Crypto → stablecoin (USDC, USDT) | **No** | Stablecoins treated as crypto-assets |
| **Stablecoin → EUR/USD** | **Yes** | Disposal to fiat |
| Staking / mining / airdrop | See Section 8 | Different regime (BNC or BIC) |

**Crypto-to-crypto deferral rule:** exchanges between crypto-assets do not trigger taxation. Only conversion to fiat currency (or use as payment) is a taxable event.

---

## Section 4 — PAMC Method (Prix d'Acquisition Moyen Pondéré en Continu)

### Official formula

```
capital_gain = disposal_price − (total_portfolio_acquisition_cost × disposal_price / portfolio_value_before_disposal)
```

### Practical consequences

- Each disposal draws from the **global** portfolio (not FIFO, not LIFO)
- Requires tracing the **complete history** from the first purchase
- If acquisition prices are undocumented → risk of reclassification as disposal at price 0 (maximum gain)

### Recommended tools

Koinly, CoinTracking, Waltio, Cryptio. Verify that the tool correctly applies the French PAMC method.

---

## Section 5 — Tax Rates

### Default: PFU 31.4%

| Component | Rate |
|---|---|
| IR | 12.8% |
| PS (revenus du patrimoine, L. 136-6 CSS) | **18.6%** (LFSS 2026, applicable to 2025 disposals) |
| **Total PFU** | **31.4%** |

Applied on the **net annual gain** (after offsetting current-year losses).

### Option barème (since revenus 2023)

Available since LFI 2022. **Advantageous only if TMI ≤ 11%.**

The barème option is **global** — applies to all capital income for the year (dividends, interest, capital gains). Arbitrage must be performed at the global level.

---

## Section 6 — EUR 305 Exemption Threshold

| Annual gross disposals | Treatment |
|---|---|
| ≤ EUR 305 | **Total exemption** — no tax, no filing of 2086 |
| > EUR 305 | **Full taxation** on the gain (not just the excess) |

**Trap:** the threshold applies to the **gross disposal amount**, not the gain. Selling EUR 500 of crypto with only EUR 10 gain still triggers taxation on the EUR 10 gain.

---

## Section 7 — Loss Offsetting

- Current-year crypto losses **can offset** current-year crypto gains
- Crypto losses **cannot offset** standard securities capital gains (separate bucket)
- **No carryforward** of crypto losses to future years (specific rule)

---

## Section 8 — Staking, Mining, Airdrops

**Separate regime from capital gains** — taxed according to the nature of the activity:

| Activity | Probable regime | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Occasional staking | BNC non-professionnel | Valued in EUR at each reception date |
| Mining | BIC | |
| Professional staking/lending | BIC | |
| Passive airdrop (no task) | Not taxable at reception | Capital gain computed at disposal |
| Active rewards (tasks required) | BNC or salary | |

**Occasional staking — BNC declaration at reception:** value in EUR at each date of receipt. Declare on 2042-C-PRO case 5HQ (micro-BNC, 34% abattement) or 5HG (réel). Micro-BNC exemption if receipts ≤ EUR 305.

**Grey zone:** DGFiP doctrine is evolving. Check latest BOFiP positions.

---

## Section 9 — Form 2086 (Mandatory Disclosure)

Mandatory for **every disposal** once annual gross disposals exceed EUR 305.

**Per-disposal details required:**
- Date of disposal
- Portfolio value before disposal
- Total portfolio acquisition cost
- Disposal price
- Computed gain or loss

**Reporting on 2042-C:**
- Case **3AN**: net annual gain (profit)
- Case **3BN**: net annual loss

---

## Section 10 — Documentation Requirements

Retain for **minimum 6 years** (statute of limitations):
- Complete transaction history (exchange exports)
- Proof of acquisition dates and prices
- Crypto-to-crypto exchange details (even though non-taxable — prove portfolio continuity)
- Wallet-to-wallet transfers (prove portfolio continuity)
- Staking reward exports with fiat valuation at each reception date

---

## Section 11 — Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Activity classification unclear | Occasional (particulier regime) |
| Acquisition cost undocumented | EUR 0 (maximum gain — conservative from tax authority perspective) |
| Staking income classification unclear | BNC non-professionnel |
| PFU vs barème unclear | PFU (no global commitment) |
| Stablecoin → stablecoin | Non-taxable (crypto-to-crypto) |

---
