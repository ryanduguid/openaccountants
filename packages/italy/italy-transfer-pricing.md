### Important Note on Penalty Reform

From violations committed from 1 September 2024 onward (i.e., FY2023 returns filed after September 2024), the penalty rate for TP adjustments without proper documentation is reduced to 70% of additional tax. For prior violations, the range was 90-180%.

## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

Italy does not have formal safe harbour provisions for transfer pricing.

| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Low-value intra-group services | No statutory safe harbour; OECD simplified approach may be accepted in practice |
| Interest rates | No formal safe harbour; market benchmarking required |
| General | All controlled transactions must be supported by arm's length analysis |
| Penalty protection | While not a "safe harbour" per se, the penalty protection regime provides certainty on penalty exposure |

### 8.1 Penalty Protection as Practical Safe Harbour

The Italian penalty protection regime functions as a practical substitute for safe harbours:
- Properly documented transactions enjoy zero penalty on adjustments
- This incentivises comprehensive documentation rather than simplified pricing rules
- Taxpayers must demonstrate they applied appropriate methods even if the result is later adjusted

### 8.2 Low-Value Intra-Group Services

While Italy has no formal rule, the Agenzia generally accepts:
- 5% cost-plus mark-up for routine/low-value services (consistent with OECD Chapter VII)
- This must still be supported by documentation demonstrating the services were actually rendered and the cost base is correct
