## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-IT-F1 -- Choosing S.r.l.s. for a growing business.** "The S.r.l.s. has a rigid, non-customisable statuto and a capital ceiling of €9,999. It cannot accommodate investor-friendly provisions. Advise standard S.r.l. for any business expecting growth or external investment."

**R-IT-F2 -- Failing to set up PEC.** "PEC is legally mandatory. Failure to have an active PEC address can result in fines and makes the company unreachable for official communications."

**R-IT-F3 -- Ignoring tassa concessione governativa.** "The €309.87 annual government concession tax for company books is often overlooked by founders. It is mandatory regardless of turnover."

**R-IT-F4 -- Single-shareholder S.r.l. with only 25% paid up.** "For single-shareholder S.r.l., the law requires 100% of capital to be paid up at formation. The 25% minimum applies only to multi-shareholder S.r.l."

**R-IT-F5 -- In-kind contributions in S.r.l.s.** "The S.r.l.s. only permits cash contributions. In-kind contributions are prohibited. Use a standard S.r.l. if non-cash contributions are needed."
