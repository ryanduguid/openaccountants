## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### SDI Channels

| Channel | Description | Use Case |
|---|---|---|
| SDICoop (Web Service) | SOAP-based web service | High-volume automated B2B |
| SDIFTP | Secure FTP with mutual TLS | Legacy system integration |
| SPCoop | Public connectivity system | B2G via PA network |
| PEC (Certified Email) | Posta Elettronica Certificata | Low-volume, initial setup |
| Web Portal | fatturapa.gov.it upload | Manual submission |
| Peppol | Via Peppol Access Point | Cross-border interoperability |

### Routing

- **CodiceDestinatario**: 7-character alphanumeric code registered with SDI (B2B). If unknown, use `0000000` and the invoice routes via PEC or the buyer's tax drawer (cassetto fiscale).
- **B2G**: 6-character CodiceUnivocoUfficio from the IPA (Indice delle Pubbliche Amministrazioni).
- **PEC fallback**: If CodiceDestinatario is `0000000`, the buyer's PEC address registered with AdE is used.

### Submission Deadlines

| Invoice Type | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Immediate invoice | 12 days from transaction date |
| Deferred invoice (TD24) | 15th of month following the reference month |
| Cross-border (TD17--TD19) | 15th of month following receipt of foreign invoice |

### SDI Processing Flow

1. Sender transmits XML (signed or unsigned) to SDI
2. SDI performs format and content validation
3. If valid → SDI delivers to recipient and issues delivery receipt (Ricevuta di Consegna)
4. If invalid → SDI issues rejection notice (Notifica di Scarto) within 5 days
5. Rejected invoices are treated as never issued -- must be corrected and resubmitted within 5 days

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### SDI Pre-Checks (Automated)

| Check | Error Code Range | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Schema validation | 00001--00100 | XML does not conform to FatturaPA XSD |
| Duplicate detection | 00404 | Same sender, invoice number, date, and recipient already processed |
| VAT number validation | 00301--00305 | IdFiscaleIVA not registered in Anagrafe Tributaria |
| CodiceDestinatario | 00311 | Invalid or unregistered routing code |
| Digital signature | 00200--00205 | Signature invalid, expired, or non-conformant |
| File naming | 00001 | File name does not follow convention: `IT{IdFiscale}_{progressive}.xml` |

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Invalid Partita IVA | Verify against VIES or AdE registry |
| Duplicate invoice number | Check progressive numbering; reissue with different number |
| Incorrect TipoDocumento | Match document type to transaction (e.g., TD04 for credit notes) |
| Missing Natura code | Required when AliquotaIVA = 0 (e.g., N1 for excluded, N2 for non-subject, N3 for non-taxable, N4 for exempt, N6 for reverse charge) |
| Rounding errors | VAT amount must match: ImponibileImporto × AliquotaIVA / 100, rounded to 2 decimal places |
| Expired digital certificate | Renew CAdES or XAdES certificate before submission |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates (2025/2026)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 22% | Standard rate |
| 10% | Reduced rate (hospitality, renovation, certain food) |
| 5% | Super-reduced (specific goods) |
| 4% | Minimum rate (essential food, books, first home) |
| 0% | Zero-rated (exports, intra-EU supplies with valid VIES) |

### Rounding

- Line-level: `PrezzoTotale = PrezzoUnitario × Quantita`, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Summary-level: `Imposta = ImponibileImporto × AliquotaIVA / 100`, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Standard arithmetic rounding (0.5 rounds up)
- SDI rejects invoices where computed VAT differs from stated VAT by more than EUR 1.00 per rate summary line

### Multi-Rate Invoices

Each VAT rate on the invoice must have its own `DatiRiepilogo` block with separate `ImponibileImporto` and `Imposta` totals. Line items are grouped by `AliquotaIVA`. The `Natura` code is required for any line with AliquotaIVA = 0.

### Split Payment (Scissione dei Pagamenti)

For B2G transactions and certain designated entities, the buyer withholds VAT and pays it directly to the Treasury. Set `EsigibilitaIVA` to `S` (split payment). The seller invoices the gross amount but receives only the net.

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 10 years (conservazione sostitutiva) |

| Third-party archiving | Must use AGID-accredited conservators (Conservatori Accreditati) |
| Audit access | Tax authorities may request full read access to the archive at any time |

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Rejected invoice not corrected within 5 days | Invoice treated as never issued -- full non-issuance penalties apply |
| Reduced penalty (ravvedimento operoso) | Reduced to 1/9 if corrected within 90 days; 1/8 within annual return deadline |

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT Return Integration

- All invoices transiting SDI are automatically available in the taxpayer's "Fatture e Corrispettivi" portal
- AdE pre-populates quarterly VAT communications (LIPE) and the annual VAT return (Modello IVA) using SDI data
- The pre-filled draft VAT return (dichiarazione precompilata IVA) has been available since 2021 for taxpayers who exclusively use SDI
- Cross-border document types (TD17--TD19, TD28) automatically feed into the reverse charge and intra-EU acquisition sections of the VAT return
- Discrepancies between SDI data and filed VAT returns trigger automated compliance letters (lettere di compliance)

### Income Tax Integration

- SDI data feeds into the pre-compiled income tax return (Modello Redditi PF precompilato) for self-employed individuals
- Revenue figures from Box 1 of the income return should reconcile with total TD01/TD24 invoices issued via SDI
- Forfettari regime taxpayers have flat-rate income computed from SDI-reported revenue

### Withholding Tax

- For professional services (TD06 parcella), the `DatiRitenuta` block in FatturaPA records withholding tax (ritenuta d'acconto) details
- Withholding amount, rate, and payment type flow into the Certificazione Unica (CU) and Modello 770
