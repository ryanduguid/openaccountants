## Kammaren Tax Engine

- Repository: [Baltsar/kammaren-tax-engine](https://github.com/Baltsar/kammaren-tax-engine)
- License: AGPL-3.0
- Language: Swedish / English
- Scope: Deterministic Swedish tax engine for income year 2026, including income tax, employer fees, municipal tax rates, and 3:12 rules for closely held companies.
- Why it matters: This appears to be the most carefully tested Swedish tax engine found so far. It states that its income tax output is verified against Skatteverket's official 2026 tax table row by row.
- Integration approach:
  - AGPL-3.0 is the same license family as OpenAccountants. Content can be incorporated with attribution.
  - Use as a validation reference and source for Swedish income tax, municipal tax, employer fees, and 3:12 rule modelling.
  - Tax constants and formulas verified row-by-row against SKV 433 Table 30 — strong validation target.

- License: MIT
- Language: Swedish
- Scope: Swedish cryptocurrency tax calculator that computes capital gains and losses using the average cost method and generates K4 and T2 supporting schedules.
