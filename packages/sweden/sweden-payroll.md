## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Preliminärskatt)

### Tax Components

| Component | Rate (2026) | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| Municipal tax (kommunalskatt) | ~28.93% -- 35.65% (average 32.38%) | All taxable income |
| State income tax (statlig inkomstskatt) | 20% | Annual income above SEK 643,100 |
| Church tax (kyrkoavgift) | ~1% -- 1.5% | Members of Swedish Church only |
| Funeral fee (begravningsavgift) | ~0.25% | All taxpayers |

### How Withholding Works

Swedish employers withhold preliminary income tax (preliminärskatt/PAYE) based on tax tables issued annually by Skatteverket. Each employee has a tax table determined by:

| Factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Municipality of residence | Determines kommunalskatt rate |
| Table type (kolumn) | Column in table based on deductions (standard: column 1) |
| Special income tax for non-residents (SINK) | Flat 22.5% (from 1 January 2026, reduced from 25%) |
| A-skatt vs F-skatt | A = employee withholding; F = self-employed (no withholding by payer) |

### Key Tax Deductions (Reducing Taxable Income)

| Deduction | Amount (2026) |
|---|---|
| Basic deduction (grundavdrag) | SEK 15,400 -- 40,000 (income-dependent) |
| Job tax credit (jobbskatteavdrag) | Automatic, income-dependent (max ~SEK 36,000/year) |
| Pension contributions (employee voluntary) | Deductible up to limits |
| Interest on debt | 30% tax reduction on interest paid |

### Withholding Mechanism

- Employer downloads/applies Skatteverket tax tables monthly
- Tax tables already incorporate grundavdrag and jobbskatteavdrag
- No separate calculation needed -- look up gross monthly salary in table
- Employees can apply for adjusted tax (jämkning) if deductions warrant lower withholding
- Non-table tax (särskild beräkningsgrund) possible for specific situations

### Effective Tax Rates (Approximate, 2026)

| Monthly Gross (SEK) | Effective Tax Rate (incl. jobbskatteavdrag) |
|---|---|
| 25,000 | ~22% |
| 35,000 | ~26% |
| 50,000 | ~31% |
| 75,000 | ~37% |
| 100,000 | ~42% |

## Section 3 -- Social Security: Employee Deductions

| Contribution | Rate |
|---|---|
| Employee social security contributions | **0%** |

Sweden is unique: employees pay NO separate social security contributions. All social insurance funding comes from employer contributions (arbetsgivaravgifter) and general taxation. The income tax employees pay covers both income tax and indirectly funds the welfare system.

### Employee Pension Contributions (Voluntary)

| Type | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tjänstepension (occupational pension) | Employer-paid via collective agreement (ITP/SAF-LO) |
| Private pension savings | Employee's own choice; tax-deductible within limits |
| Mandatory public pension (allmän pension) | Funded through employer's ålderspensionsavgift (10.21%) |

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Skill | Interaction |
|---|---|
| sweden-bookkeeping | Payroll journal entries (7xxx accounts), employer contribution accruals, holiday pay liability |
| payroll-workflow-base | General payroll processing workflow; Sweden-specific overrides in this skill |

### Sweden-Specific Payroll Considerations

- **No employee SS contributions**: All social insurance is funded by employer. Employees only pay income tax.
- **No statutory minimum wage**: Always check applicable kollektivavtal. Non-covered employers set wages individually but risk industrial action.
- **Collective agreement is king**: ITP/SAF-LO pension, TGL insurance, overtime rates, and many benefits are determined by the applicable collective agreement, not by statute.
- **Tax tables**: Employers must apply correct kommun-based table. Employees moving between municipalities may have different rates mid-year.
- **Förmånsvärde (taxable benefits)**: Company cars, housing, meals, etc. have standardised taxable values set by Skatteverket. These are added to gross salary for tax purposes AND subject to arbetsgivaravgifter.
- **Karensdag (qualifying day)**: First sick day is unpaid (since 2019, previously first day only had deduction of 20% of average weekly salary).
- **Semesterlagen**: 25 vacation days minimum. Employees CANNOT waive this right. Carried-over days above 25 may be saved for up to 5 years.
