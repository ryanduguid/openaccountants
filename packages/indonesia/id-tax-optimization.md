# Indonesia Tax Optimization -- Self-Employed & Small Business Skill v1.0

---

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference: When Each Regime / Entity Wins

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Republic of Indonesia (Republik Indonesia) |
| Tax authority | Direktorat Jenderal Pajak (DJP) -- Ministry of Finance (Kementerian Keuangan) |
| Key optimization legislation | UU 36/2008 (Pajak Penghasilan -- "UU PPh"); UU 7/2021 (Harmonisasi Peraturan Perpajakan -- "UU HPP"); PP 55/2022 (PPh Final UMKM 0.5%); PP 58/2023 (PPh 21 withholding rules); PMK 168/2023 (PPh 21 implementation); PER-17/PJ/2015 (Norma Penghitungan Penghasilan Neto -- NPPN); UU 28/2007 (Ketentuan Umum Perpajakan -- "KUP"); UU 40/2007 (Perseroan Terbatas); UU 11/2020 (Cipta Kerja) -- PT Perorangan |
| Currency | Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan -- 31 Dec) |
| Annual return (SPT Tahunan PPh OP) deadline | 31 March of the following year for individuals (Orang Pribadi -- OP); 30 April for corporates (Badan) |
| GAAR posture | Indonesia does not have a fully codified statutory GAAR but applies a substance-over-form doctrine via Pasal 18 UU PPh (special relationships and arm's-length adjustments) and KUP Article 28 (bookkeeping integrity). Pasal 28A of UU KUP empowers DJP to disregard transactions lacking economic substance. Treaty anti-abuse rules apply under PER-25/PJ/2018 (beneficial owner certification). |

### When each option wins -- one-line rules of thumb

| Situation | Best option |
|---|---|
| Revenue < IDR 500M/year | UMKM 0.5% (zero-rate band, but check margin) |
| Revenue 500M -- 4.8B, low margin | UMKM Final 0.5% on gross |
| Revenue 500M -- 4.8B, high-margin services | UMKM Final (usually) -- compare to NPPN below |
| Used UMKM 7 years already (OP) | Mandatory exit; progressive only |
| Revenue > 4.8B sustained | Pembukuan; consider PT Perorangan / PT |
| Operating losses expected | Pembukuan -- only regime with 5-yr loss carry-forward |
| Land/building rental income | PPh Final Pasal 4(2) 10% applies automatically |
| Construction services | PPh Final Pasal 4(2) per PP 9/2022 -- rate by SBU class |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before any planning recommendation

1. Gross annual turnover (peredaran bruto) -- last 3 years + current-year projection.
2. Net margin -- approximate net / gross. Critical for break-even.
3. Entity form -- OP, CV/firma, PT Perorangan, PT, koperasi.
4. Years inside UMKM regime -- 7-year cap for OP, 3-4 years for badan (PP 55/2022).
5. NPWP status -- single or married with PH/MT/HB code.
6. Marital status -- TK / K / K/I.
7. Dependents (max 3 per Pasal 7(3)).
8. Income sources -- usaha / pekerjaan bebas / employment / rental / capital / foreign.
9. BPJS enrolment -- Kesehatan and Ketenagakerjaan (JHT/JKK/JKM/JP).
10. KLU code -- determines NPPN % and PPh Final classification.

### Refusal catalogue (out of scope -- escalate to a registered Konsultan Pajak)

| # | Topic |
|---|---|
| R-1 | Treaty shopping / conduit entities (Singapore, HK, NL) for P3B benefits -- needs BEPS / PER-25/PJ/2018 analysis |
| R-2 | Controlled Foreign Corporation rules (PMK 93/PMK.03/2019) |
| R-3 | Transfer pricing structures, intra-group services, royalty restructuring (PMK 213/PMK.03/2016) |
| R-4 | Tax amnesty (PPS) / voluntary disclosure participation |
| R-5 | "Paper PT" with no real operations -- disregarded under Pasal 28A KUP and Pasal 18 UU PPh |
| R-6 | Aggressive split-invoicing between OP and PT controlled by same person (Pasal 18(3) re-attribution) |
| R-7 | Sector-specific regimes: mining, O&G, plantation, financial services |
| R-8 | Property developer regime under PP 34/2016 |
| R-9 | E-commerce marketplace seller PPN/PPh 22 issues (PER-37/PJ/2022) |
| R-10 | Cryptocurrency mining / staking optimization (PMK 68/PMK.03/2022) |

---

## Section 3 -- Regime Selection: Break-Even Between the Three OP Regimes

Indonesian self-employed individuals (Orang Pribadi) generally choose between **three** regimes for taxing business / professional income. Each has dramatically different mechanics.

### 3.1 The three regimes summarized

| Regime | Legislation | Mechanics |
|---|---|---|
| **UMKM Final 0.5%** | PP 55/2022 | 0.5% × gross monthly turnover, paid monthly; no expense deduction; final tax. OP ≤ IDR 4.8B turnover; max 7 years OP / 3 years badan (Art. 5). |
| **Progressive with NPPN** (deemed net income) | Pasal 14(2) UU PPh; PER-17/PJ/2015 | DJP-published deemed-profit % × gross revenue, then PTKP, then progressive brackets. Requires notification to DJP within first 3 months of tax year. |
| **Progressive with Pembukuan** | Pasal 14(1); Pasal 28 KUP | Full accrual bookkeeping; Pasal 6 deductions / Pasal 9 add-backs; PTKP; progressive. Mandatory above IDR 4.8B. Only regime allowing 5-year loss carry-forward (Pasal 6(2)). |

### 3.2 The 2025 PTKP and progressive brackets

**PTKP (Penghasilan Tidak Kena Pajak) -- 2025**, per PMK 101/PMK.010/2016 (unchanged through 2025; current PTKP rates):

| Code | Annual PTKP (IDR) |
|---|---|
| TK/0 (single, no dependents) | 54,000,000 |
| TK/1 | 58,500,000 |
| TK/2 | 63,000,000 |
| TK/3 | 67,500,000 |
| K/0 (married, no dependents) | 58,500,000 |
| K/1 | 63,000,000 |
| K/2 | 67,500,000 |
| K/3 | 72,000,000 |
| K/I/0 (married, spouse's income combined, no dependents) | 112,500,000 |
| K/I/3 | 126,000,000 |

**Progressive brackets -- Pasal 17(1)(a) UU PPh, as amended by UU HPP 7/2021:**

| Annual taxable income (IDR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 60,000,000 | 5% |
| 60,000,001 -- 250,000,000 | 15% |
| 250,000,001 -- 500,000,000 | 25% |
| 500,000,001 -- 5,000,000,000 | 30% |
| > 5,000,000,000 | 35% |

### 3.3 The UMKM Final 0.5% zero-rate band

Per PP 55/2022 Art. 60: for OP, the **first IDR 500 million** of gross annual turnover is taxed at **0%**. The 0.5% applies only above that. Example: R = 800M → PPh Final = 0.5% × 300M = **IDR 1,500,000**.

### 3.4 Break-even formula -- UMKM vs Progressive with NPPN

Let R = gross revenue, n = NPPN deemed-profit %, P = PTKP, T(·) = progressive function.

- PPh UMKM = 0.5% × max(R − 500,000,000, 0)
- PPh NPPN = T(max(n·R − P, 0))

UMKM wins when 0.005 × max(R − 500M, 0) < T(max(n·R − P, 0)).

### 3.5 NPPN deemed-profit rates -- common categories (PER-17/PJ/2015)

The actual table covers ~1,500 KLU codes across 3 city tiers (Jakarta + 9 major cities; other provincial capitals; other locations). Always look up the exact KLU.

| Activity (KLU) | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Software / IT services | 50% | 50% | 50% |
| Lawyer / consultant (pekerjaan bebas) | 51% | 50% | 50% |
| Retail trade (general) | 30% | 25% | 20% |
| Restaurants / food services | 25% | 22.5% | 20% |
| Construction (subject to PPh Final 4(2) override) | 23.5% | 21.5% | 20% |

### 3.6 Pembukuan -- when it beats both UMKM and NPPN

- Actual margin < NPPN deemed margin (NPPN taxes phantom income).
- Operating losses expected -- only pembukuan allows 5-year loss carry-forward (Pasal 6(2)).
- Heavy capex -- only pembukuan allows depreciation (Pasal 11).
- Mixed usaha + pekerjaan bebas income; or PPh 24 foreign tax credit claims.

---

## Section 4 -- Entity Choice: OP vs PT Perorangan vs PT

### 4.1 The three entity types in the small-business space

| Entity | Legislation | Liability | Tax treatment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orang Pribadi (OP) -- sole trader | UU PPh (no separate entity law -- registered via NPWP only) | Unlimited personal liability | Personal PPh (regimes in Section 3) |
| PT Perorangan (single-shareholder micro/small PT) | UU 11/2020 (Cipta Kerja), PP 8/2021 | Limited liability | Corporate PPh per Pasal 17(2a) UU PPh -- 22% standard, or UMKM Final 0.5% if eligible (max 3 years for badan per PP 55/2022 Art. 5(2)) |
| PT (Perseroan Terbatas) -- standard limited company | UU 40/2007 | Limited liability | Corporate PPh 22%; UMKM Final 0.5% for max 3 years if turnover ≤ 4.8B |

### 4.2 Tax + administrative cost trade-off

| Factor | OP | PT Perorangan | PT |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup cost | ~ IDR 0 | ~ IDR 50,000 (AHU online) | IDR 5M -- 15M (notary, OSS, NIB) |
| Minimum capital | None | Self-declared | Self-declared since Cipta Kerja |
| Audit requirement | No | Only if turnover ≥ IDR 50B / regulated sector | Same |
| Monthly PPh 25 | Only if pembukuan | Yes | Yes |
| Annual filing | Form 1770 by 31 March | Form 1771 by 30 April | Form 1771 by 30 April |
| Dividend tax on extraction | N/A | 10% PPh Final, **or exempt** if reinvested (Pasal 4(3)(f) UU PPh / HPP) | Same |
| Salary to owner | N/A | Deductible at PT if reasonable; PPh 21 to owner | Same |
| Substance risk | Low | Medium -- DJP scrutinises paper PT | Lower |

### 4.3 Decision heuristic

- Revenue < IDR 500M, low expenses → OP + UMKM Final (effectively zero tax via zero-rate band).
- Revenue IDR 500M -- 2.5B, profitable → OP + UMKM Final for 7 years, then revisit.
- Revenue IDR 2.5B -- 4.8B, liability protection wanted → PT Perorangan + UMKM Final (max 3 years), then progressive corporate.
- Revenue > IDR 4.8B sustained → PT (or PT Perorangan if eligible), pembukuan, 22% corporate, plan reinvestment per HPP 4(3)(f).

### 4.4 The 22% corporate-rate reinvestment opportunity

Per Pasal 4(3)(f) UU PPh (as amended by UU HPP), dividends received by Indonesian resident individuals or entities are **exempt from PPh** if reinvested in Indonesia within 3 years in qualifying instruments (PMK 18/2021). This converts 22% + 10% dividend = 29.8% combined into a clean 22% -- a ~7.8 pp saving versus extraction.

---

## Section 5 -- PTKP Optimization

PTKP (Penghasilan Tidak Kena Pajak) is the personal allowance deducted before applying progressive brackets. It only matters under the **progressive** regimes (NPPN or pembukuan). It is irrelevant under UMKM Final.

### 5.1 Joint vs separate assessment for married couples

Per Pasal 8(1)-(3) UU PPh:

| Status | NPWP arrangement | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **KK -- default joint (Kepala Keluarga)** | Spouse on husband's NPWP; combined PTKP K/I/n | Default. PTKP from IDR 112.5M for K/I/0. |
| **PH (Pisah Harta)** | Own NPWP each, with notarised property-separation agreement | Both spouses have substantial business income. |
| **MT (Memilih Terpisah)** | Own NPWP each; tax computed jointly then allocated by gross income | Simpler compromise. |
| **HB (Hidup Berpisah)** | Legally separated by court order | Each files independently TK/n. |

### 5.2 Joint filing benefit when one spouse's income is final

If one spouse earns income already taxed as PPh Final (e.g., UMKM under PP 55/2022 or PPh Final 4(2) rental), that income is **excluded** from the joint progressive calculation per Pasal 4(2). Joint filing then only adds non-Final income while Final income is settled. This is legislative design, not avoidance.

### 5.3 Dependents -- 3 maximum (Pasal 7(3) UU PPh)

Maximum **3 dependents** count for PTKP. Each adds IDR 4,500,000. Eligible: blood relatives in direct line (parents, parents-in-law) wholly maintained; adopted/step-children fully maintained. Lateral line (siblings) generally not counted unless sole-maintenance proven.

**Planning:** dependent status fixed at **1 January** (Pasal 7(2)). Time qualifying events (marriage, parental dependency declaration) before year-end.

### 5.4 PTKP cash impact -- worked example

OP, married, two children, all on his NPWP (K/2 = IDR 67.5M PTKP). NPPN deemed net IDR 200M.

- K/2: taxable 132.5M → PPh 13,875,000.
- If forgot to register (TK/0, PTKP 54M): taxable 146M → PPh 15,900,000.

Saving from registering dependents: **IDR 2,025,000/year**. Register on NPWP via KSWP / DJP Online before filing.

---

## Section 6 -- Deductible Expense Planning (Pasal 6) and Pasal 9 Non-Deductibles

Only relevant under **pembukuan** (full bookkeeping). Under NPPN, the deemed-profit % includes implicit expense allowance; under UMKM Final, expenses are irrelevant.

### 6.1 Pasal 6 UU PPh -- deductible business expenses

| Category | Reference | Planning note |
|---|---|---|
| Costs of obtaining, collecting, maintaining income | Pasal 6(1)(a) | The general rule -- direct nexus required. |
| Depreciation / amortization | Pasal 6(1)(b); Pasal 11, 11A | See Section 6.3. |
| Pension fund contributions to DJP-approved fund | Pasal 6(1)(c) | Employer DPLK + employee voluntary up to allowed limits. |
| Realized losses on disposal of fixed assets | Pasal 6(1)(d) | Time disposals strategically. |
| Realized FX losses | Pasal 6(1)(e) | Unrealized FX subject to specific rules. |
| R&D in Indonesia | Pasal 6(1)(f); PMK 153/2020 | **Super deduction up to 300%** -- major opportunity. |
| Vocational training | Pasal 6(1)(g); PMK 128/2019 | **Super deduction up to 200%** in priority sectors. |
| Bad debts written off | Pasal 6(1)(h) | DJP notification per PMK 207/2015. |
| Approved donations | Pasal 6(1)(i)-(m); PP 93/2010 | Up to 5% of prior year net income, DJP-approved channels. |

### 6.2 Pasal 9 -- non-deductible items (always disallowed)

| Item | Reference | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Dividend distributions | Pasal 9(1)(a) | Use reinvestment exemption (§4.4). |
| Reserves / provisions (except sector-approved) | Pasal 9(1)(c) | No general bad-debt provision. |
| Insurance premiums on OP himself (life/health/accident) | Pasal 9(1)(d) | Employee health insurance is deductible. |
| Excess related-party remuneration | Pasal 9(1)(f) | Arm's-length scrutiny. |
| Personal donations / personal expenses of owner | Pasal 9(1)(g)-(h) | Segregate clearly. |
| Salary OP pays to himself | Pasal 9(1)(j) | Genuine spouse/family salary may be deductible. |
| PPh paid; penalties | Pasal 9(1)(h),(k) | PBB / PB1 are deductible; PPh never. |
| Entertainment without Daftar Nominatif | SE-27/PJ.22/1986 | Must list date, place, purpose, attendees -- else disallowed. |

### 6.3 Depreciation (Pasal 11 UU PPh; PMK 96/PMK.03/2009)

| Group | Life | Straight-line | Declining-balance |
|---|---|---|---|
| I (computers, office equipment) | 4 yr | 25% | 50% |
| II | 8 yr | 12.5% | 25% |
| III | 16 yr | 6.25% | 12.5% |
| IV | 20 yr | 5% | 10% |
| Building -- permanent | 20 yr | 5% | n/a |
| Building -- non-permanent | 10 yr | 10% | n/a |

Election straight-line vs declining-balance is per asset group, applied consistently. Declining-balance front-loads deductions. Depreciation starts month of first business use, pro-rated monthly.

---

## Section 7 -- PPh Final Pasal 4(2) Planning

Pasal 4(2) UU PPh covers categories where income is taxed at a **flat final rate** at the gross level, separate from the OP's progressive computation. These cannot be opted out of -- they apply automatically by the nature of the income.

### 7.1 Rental of land and/or buildings

**PP 34/2017** -- 10% final tax on gross rent.

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Gross-up clause in lease | Make the lease state who bears the 10% PPh Final to avoid disputes. |
| Service charges vs rent | Maintenance / security / cleaning charges are not rent -- subject to PPh 23 or progressive instead. Separate the contract. |
| Furnished rental | Land/building portion is 4(2); furniture rental can sometimes be split off. |
| Sub-leasing | Sub-rent is 10% on gross; rent paid out is not deductible (final-tax category). |

### 7.2 Construction services

**PP 9/2022** (amends PP 51/2008) -- final tax by SBU certification class:

| Service type | SBU status | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Execution (pelaksanaan) -- small | Certified | 1.75% |
| Execution -- medium/large | Certified | 2.65% |
| Execution | Uncertified | 4% |
| Planning / supervision | Certified | 3.5% |
| Planning / supervision | Uncertified | 6% |
| Integrated construction | Certified / Uncertified | 2.65% / 4% |

A valid SBU from LPJK saves 1.35-2.5 pp on every invoice -- certification cost is usually trivial against single-project savings.

### 7.3 Other Pasal 4(2) categories worth noting

- Bank interest 20% (PP 131/2000); bond interest 10% (PP 91/2021); lottery 25%.
- IDX share sales 0.1% of gross; land/building sales 2.5% (PP 34/2016).
- Listed-share dividends to individuals: 10% PPh Final, **or exempt** if reinvested per HPP / PMK 18/2021.

---

## Section 8 -- BPJS Optimization

Indonesian social security comes in two branches:

### 8.1 BPJS Kesehatan (health) -- Perpres 64/2020

- PBPU (self-employed): flat IDR 35,000 (class III) / 100,000 (class II) / 150,000 (class I) per family member per month.
- PPU (employee): 5% of salary, 4% employer + 1% employee.
- **Wage cap: IDR 12,000,000/month.** Salary above the cap incurs no additional BPJS Kesehatan -- structure bonuses / top-up above 12M to capture this.

### 8.2 BPJS Ketenagakerjaan (employment) -- UU 24/2011 + PP 44/45/46 2015

| Programme | Employer | Employee | Wage cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| JKK (work accident) | 0.24% -- 1.74% (risk class) | 0 | None |
| JKM (death) | 0.30% | 0 | None |
| JHT (old age) | 3.7% | 2% | None |
| JP (pension) | 2% | 1% | **IDR ~10,547,400/month** (2025; adjusted annually -- TBC against latest Permenaker) |

**Planning:** structuring founder compensation so fixed monthly wage sits just above the JP cap maximises pension coverage with no further JP cost. Employer BPJS deductible under Pasal 6(1)(c); employee parts reduce PPh 21 base. A self-employed OP without employees usually only pays BPJS Kesehatan PBPU.

### 8.3 BPJS deductibility recap

| Payer | Deductible? |
|---|---|
| Employer PT -- all BPJS employer parts | Yes -- Pasal 6(1)(c). |
| Employee parts in payroll | Reduce employee PPh 21 base (PMK 168/2023). |
| OP self -- BPJS PBPU | Generally not deductible for OP himself (analogue to Pasal 9(1)(d)); employed family members: yes. |

---

## Section 9 -- Year-End Timing of Expenses & Income Recognition

Indonesia uses **accrual basis** for pembukuan (per SAK / PSAK). Cash basis is generally not permitted except where DJP has explicitly allowed it for specific professions / small OPs. NPPN effectively operates on a "received" basis (gross revenue earned), and UMKM Final is monthly on gross received.

### 9.1 Income deferral techniques (accrual basis)

| Technique | Notes |
|---|---|
| Invoice in January for December delivery | Only valid if performance actually completes in January -- substance over form. |
| Stage-based recognition (PSAK 72) | Plan project milestones around year-end if contract terms genuinely allow. |
| Advance receipts | Deposits for future work are liabilities, not revenue, until performance. |
| Year-end rebate / discount accruals | Must be contractual; conditional discounts only when conditions met. |

### 9.2 Expense acceleration techniques

| Technique | Notes |
|---|---|
| Prepay annual contracts in December | Under accrual, only the portion accruing to current year is deductible (unless service fully delivered in year). |
| Year-end bonus accrual | Declared and committed before year-end -- expense current year, PPh 21 when paid. |
| Asset purchase before year-end | Depreciation starts month of first business use -- December gives 1 month. |
| Bad debt write-off | Clear evidence of failure + PMK 207/2015 notification. |
| R&D / vocational training spend | Super deductions up to 300% / 200% (PMK 153/2020; PMK 128/2019). |

### 9.3 Regime choice is a January decision

- UMKM Final 0.5% must be elected at start of year or first NPWP registration.
- NPPN requires DJP notification within first 3 months (PER-17/PJ/2015).
- Pembukuan always available; mandatory above IDR 4.8B.

Run the break-even on **projected** revenue and margin, not actuals -- the choice is locked once payments begin.

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Example: Software Developer Break-Even

### Setup

Single OP software developer, Jakarta:
- Gross revenue R = IDR 1,200,000,000 (~USD 75,000)
- Genuine operating expenses = IDR 200,000,000 (actual margin ~83%)
- NPPN % for software Tier 1 (Jakarta) = 50%
- TK/0 → PTKP IDR 54,000,000
- 2 years already used inside UMKM (5 years remain)

### Option A -- UMKM Final 0.5%

PPh = 0.5% × (1,200,000,000 − 500,000,000) = **IDR 3,500,000**.

### Option B -- Progressive PPh with NPPN

- Deemed net = 50% × 1,200,000,000 = 600,000,000.
- Taxable = 600,000,000 − 54,000,000 = **546,000,000**.
- PPh (brackets 5/15/25/30): 3,000,000 + 28,500,000 + 62,500,000 + 13,800,000 = **IDR 107,800,000**.

### Option C -- Progressive PPh with Pembukuan

- Actual net = 1,200,000,000 − 200,000,000 = 1,000,000,000.
- Taxable = 1,000,000,000 − 54,000,000 = **946,000,000**.
- PPh: 3,000,000 + 28,500,000 + 62,500,000 + 133,800,000 = **IDR 227,800,000**.

### Verdict

| Regime | PPh (IDR) | Effective rate on revenue |
|---|---|---|
| **UMKM Final 0.5%** | **3,500,000** | 0.29% |
| Progressive + NPPN | 107,800,000 | 8.98% |
| Progressive + Pembukuan | 227,800,000 | 18.98% |

UMKM Final dominates because (1) high actual margin (~83%), (2) revenue under IDR 4.8B ceiling, (3) first IDR 500M at 0%.

**Forward-looking planning:** UMKM is available for **only 7 years**. From year 8 onwards this developer pays NPPN (IDR 107.8M) or pembukuan (IDR 227.8M) on the same income -- prepare for the cliff.

### Break-even rules of thumb (Jakarta NPPN 50%, TK/0)

- UMKM dominates NPPN at virtually all revenues up to the 4.8B ceiling.
- UMKM dominates pembukuan whenever actual margin > ~12%.
- NPPN beats pembukuan whenever actual margin > 50%; pembukuan beats NPPN whenever margin < 50%.

---

## Section 11 -- Conservative Defaults

| Scenario | Default |
|---|---|
| UMKM 7-year clock uncertain | Treat as expired -- recommend pembukuan plan (illegal continuation = recalc + 2%/month surcharge per Pasal 19 KUP). |
| NPPN deemed-profit % uncertain | Use higher of candidate KLU codes. |
| Mixed business + employment income | Progressive PPh on combined; UMKM Final only on qualifying business slice. |
| Dependents not registered on NPWP | Apply TK/n until registration proof shown. |
| Spouse business income, no PH agreement | Assume joint (default KK). |
| Asset purchase | Capitalize and depreciate; expense only if useful life < 1 year (Pasal 11(8)). |
| Entertainment without Daftar Nominatif | Disallow entirely. |
| R&D super deduction without PMK 153/2020 ruling | Standard 100%; advise to apply for ruling. |
| Dividend reinvestment exemption | Apply only with PMK 18/2021 commitment letter on file. |
