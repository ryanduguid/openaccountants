# Indonesia Payroll — PPh 21 & BPJS Contributions Skill v1.1

> **2025 changes summary (v1.1 refresh):** PPh 21 monthly withholding continues under the TER system (PP 58/2023, PMK 168/2023 — Categories A/B/C by PTKP, year-end reconciliation under Article 17 brackets). From **1 July 2024**, Indonesian-citizen employees use their **16-digit NIK as NPWP**; foreign-national employees keep the 15-digit NPWP. From **1 January 2025**, all PPh 21 filings — monthly **SPT Masa PPh 21 / e-Bupot Unifikasi** and the **1721-A1 / 1721-A2** annual slips — flow through **Coretax DJP** (the legacy DJP Online e-Bupot 21/26 desktop app is being retired). See `id-einvoice-coretax` for the Coretax workflow.

## Section 2 — PPh 21 progressive tax brackets (Tarif Pasal 17 UU HPP)

Tax is computed on **Penghasilan Kena Pajak (PKP)** — taxable income after deductions and PTKP.

These brackets are from UU HPP No. 7/2021, effective from 1 January 2022 onward. They are permanent and unchanged through 2025/2026.

| Annual PKP (IDR) | Rate | Max tax in bracket |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 60,000,000 | 5% | 3,000,000 |
| 60,000,001 – 250,000,000 | 15% | 28,500,000 |
| 250,000,001 – 500,000,000 | 25% | 62,500,000 |
| 500,000,001 – 5,000,000,000 | 30% | 1,350,000,000 |
| Over 5,000,000,000 | 35% | — |

> **Note:** The `steevenz/id-payroll-calculator` and `KejawenLab/PPH21` repos use the older pre-HPP brackets (first bracket 0–50M, no 35% bracket). The brackets above reflect the current law.

**No-NPWP surcharge:** Employees without an NPWP (tax ID number) are subject to an additional 20% surcharge on the calculated PPh 21 liability (per `steevenz/id-payroll-calculator` `Pph21.php`).

---

## Section 3 — PTKP (Penghasilan Tidak Kena Pajak / Non-Taxable Income)

PTKP is deducted from annual net income before applying the progressive brackets. Amounts are per PMK 101/PMK.010/2016, unchanged through 2025.

| Status code | Description | Annual PTKP (IDR) |
|---|---|---|
| TK/0 | Single, no dependents | 54,000,000 |
| TK/1 | Single, 1 dependent | 58,500,000 |
| TK/2 | Single, 2 dependents | 63,000,000 |
| TK/3 | Single, 3 dependents | 67,500,000 |
| K/0 | Married, no dependents | 58,500,000 |
| K/1 | Married, 1 dependent | 63,000,000 |
| K/2 | Married, 2 dependents | 67,500,000 |
| K/3 | Married, 3 dependents | 72,000,000 |

Additional rules:
- Maximum 3 dependents (tanggungan) are recognized
- If wife's income is combined (penghasilan digabung), add an additional IDR 54,000,000

When salary exceeds the wage ceiling, contributions are calculated on the ceiling amount, not actual salary. Example: for salary IDR 15,000,000, employer JP = 2% × 10,547,400 = IDR 210,948; employee JP = 1% × 10,547,400 = IDR 105,474.

## Section 8 — TER (Tarif Efektif Rata-rata / Average Effective Rate)

Since 1 January 2024, monthly PPh 21 withholding for permanent employees uses the TER scheme (PP 58/2023, PMK 168/2023) instead of the old cumulative method.

**How TER works:**
1. Months January–November: `PPh 21 = Gross Monthly Income × TER rate`
2. December (or final month of employment): recalculate full-year liability using progressive brackets (Section 2), then subtract all TER withheld in months 1–11

### TER category assignment

| TER Category | PTKP Status |
|---|---|
| A | TK/0, TK/1, K/0 |
| B | TK/2, TK/3, K/1, K/2 |
| C | K/3 |

## Section 9 — Annual PPh 21 computation method (December recalculation)

```
Step 1:  Gross annual income (gaji + tunjangan tetap + overtime + bonus + THR)
Step 2:  − Biaya jabatan (5%, max IDR 6,000,000/year)
Step 3:  − Iuran pensiun (employee JP contribution, if applicable)
Step 4:  = Penghasilan Neto (net income)
Step 5:  − PTKP (based on marital/dependent status)
Step 6:  = PKP (Penghasilan Kena Pajak / taxable income)
Step 7:  Apply progressive brackets (Section 2) → PPh 21 terutang (annual liability)
Step 8:  − TER amounts withheld Jan–Nov
Step 9:  = PPh 21 for December (or refund if negative)
```

---

## Section 10 — Worked example: monthly payroll calculation

**Scenario:** Permanent employee (pegawai tetap), single with no dependents (TK/0), has NPWP. Monthly base salary IDR 10,000,000. Company risk grade 2 (low). No overtime, no bonuses this month.

### A — Monthly gross earnings

| Component | Amount (IDR) |
|---|---|
| Base salary (gaji pokok) | 10,000,000 |
| Fixed allowances (tunjangan tetap) | 0 |
| **Monthly gross** | **10,000,000** |

### B — Employer BPJS contributions (company cost, not deducted from employee)

| Program | Rate | Amount (IDR) |
|---|---|---|
| BPJS Kesehatan | 4.00% × 10,000,000 | 400,000 |
| JHT | 3.70% × 10,000,000 | 370,000 |
| JP | 2.00% × 10,000,000 | 200,000 |
| JKK (grade 2) | 0.54% × 10,000,000 | 54,000 |
| JKM | 0.30% × 10,000,000 | 30,000 |
| **Total employer cost** | | **1,054,000** |

### C — Employee deductions (withheld from salary)

| Program | Rate | Amount (IDR) |
|---|---|---|
| BPJS Kesehatan | 1.00% × 10,000,000 | 100,000 |
| JHT | 2.00% × 10,000,000 | 200,000 |
| JP | 1.00% × 10,000,000 | 100,000 |
| **Total employee BPJS** | | **400,000** |

### D — Monthly PPh 21 withholding (TER method, Jan–Nov)

Status TK/0 → TER Category A. Monthly gross = IDR 10,000,000.

From TER Category A table: IDR 9,650,001 – 10,050,000 → rate = **2.00%**

```
PPh 21 monthly (TER) = 10,000,000 × 2.00% = IDR 200,000
```

### E — Take-home pay

| Component | Amount (IDR) |
|---|---|
| Monthly gross | 10,000,000 |
| − Employee BPJS | (400,000) |
| − PPh 21 (TER) | (200,000) |
| **Take-home pay** | **9,400,000** |

### F — December recalculation (annual true-up)

| Step | Description | Amount (IDR) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross annual income | 10,000,000 × 12 | 120,000,000 |
| − Biaya jabatan | 5% × 120,000,000 = 6,000,000 (at cap) | (6,000,000) |
| − Iuran pensiun (JP employee) | 100,000 × 12 | (1,200,000) |
| **Penghasilan neto** | | **112,800,000** |
| − PTKP (TK/0) | | (54,000,000) |
| **PKP** | | **58,800,000** |

Annual tax on PKP of 58,800,000:

| Bracket | Taxable in bracket | Rate | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 58,800,000 | 58,800,000 | 5% | 2,940,000 |
| **Total PPh 21 annual** | | | **2,940,000** |

PPh 21 for December:
```
PPh 21 annual          = IDR 2,940,000
− TER withheld (Jan–Nov) = 200,000 × 11 = IDR 2,200,000
PPh 21 December        = IDR 740,000
```

## Section 11 — Payroll calculation methods

The `steevenz/id-payroll-calculator` supports three PPh 21 calculation methods:

| Method | Indonesian | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NETT | Pajak ditanggung perusahaan | Employer bears the tax; employee receives full salary |
| GROSS | Pajak ditanggung karyawan | Employee bears the tax; PPh 21 deducted from salary |
| GROSS-UP | Tunjangan pajak | Employer adds a tax allowance equal to the PPh 21 liability, then deducts it — net effect same as NETT but appears on payslip |

---

## Section 12 — Filing guidance

### Who must file?

All resident individuals with income above the PTKP threshold must file an annual SPT.

## Section 13 — Conservative defaults

When in doubt:

| Situation | Conservative position |
|---|---|
