## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 2.1 Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — Full-year financial statements (income statement, balance sheet), prior-year SPT 1771, and confirmation of (i) turnover band, (ii) listed-company status, (iii) any tax incentive elections.

**Recommended** — General ledger, fixed-asset register, related-party transactions schedule, PPh 25 payment confirmations, Bukti Potong for PPh 21/22/23/26 credits, prior-year loss carry-forward schedule.

**Ideal** — Audited statements signed by an Akuntan Publik (KAP), complete fiscal reconciliation, Master/Local File/CbCR if thresholds met, NPWP and KSWP certificates, ratified RUPS minutes.

**HARD STOP if minimum is missing.** Without financial statements and the prior-year return, no corporate computation may be produced.

### 2.2 Refusal Catalogue

**R-ID-CT-1 — Non-resident / Permanent Establishment (BUT).** Resident PTs only. BUT under tax treaty attribution rules is out of scope. Escalate to a Konsultan Pajak.

**R-ID-CT-2 — Sector-specific regimes.** Banking, insurance, oil & gas (production sharing / cost recovery), mining contract of work, plantation contracts. Out of scope.

**R-ID-CT-3 — Group / consolidated reporting.** Out of scope.

**R-ID-CT-4 — Tax holiday / super-deduction not yet granted.** Apply incentives only after KMK / BKPM Decree is in hand. Otherwise compute at standard rate and flag the pending application.

**R-ID-CT-5 — Arrears / SKPKB enforcement.** Outstanding STP, SKPKB, SKPKBT, or active pemeriksaan. Pasal 9(2a) UU KUP monthly interest applies. Escalate immediately.

**R-ID-CT-6 — TP controversy.** Related-party disputes or active MAP/APA proceedings. Out of scope.

**R-ID-CT-7 — Cross-skill scope.** Payroll → `id-payroll-pph21`. VAT → `indonesia-vat`. PPh Final UMKM 0.5% → `id-pph-final-umkm`.

**R-ID-CT-8 — Islamic finance (syariah banking, takaful).** Specific PSAK Syariah and DJP rulings apply. Out of scope.

---

## Section 3 — Tier 1 Rules (Standard Computation)

### 3.1 The 22% Standard Rate

**Legislation:** Pasal 17(1)(b) UU PPh, as amended by UU 7/2021 (HPP).

Standard corporate income tax rate: **22% of Penghasilan Kena Pajak**. In force from fiscal year 2022 (reduced from 25% by UU 2/2020; confirmed by UU HPP).

```
PPh Badan = 22% × PKP
```

### 3.2 The Small-Company Facility — Pasal 31E UU PPh

**Legislation:** Pasal 31E UU 36/2008 (unchanged by UU HPP); SE-66/PJ/2010 (implementation circular).

Companies with **annual gross turnover (peredaran bruto) up to IDR 50,000,000,000** receive a 50% reduction of the 22% rate applied to the slice of taxable income proportional to the first IDR 4,800,000,000 of gross turnover. **Effective rate on the facility slice: 11%.**

**Formula:**

```
Turnover ≤ IDR 4.8B:         PPh Badan = 11% × PKP

IDR 4.8B < Turnover ≤ 50B:   Facility slice    = (4.8B / Turnover) × PKP
                              Non-facility slice = PKP − Facility slice
                              PPh Badan          = 11% × Facility + 22% × Non-facility

Turnover > IDR 50B:           PPh Badan = 22% × PKP   (no facility)
```

**Important:** Pasal 31E applies automatically — not a discretionary election. Computed for each fiscal year independently. A company that exits the IDR 50B band loses the facility for that year.

**Interaction with PPh Final UMKM 0.5%:** Cannot stack — taxpayer elects one regime or the other. PPh Final UMKM is covered in `id-pph-final-umkm` and is **time-limited for PTs** (3 years under PP 55/2022). After expiry the PT defaults to standard PPh Badan with Pasal 31E available where eligible.

### 3.3 Listed-Company Reduction — Pasal 17(2b)

**Legislation:** Pasal 17(2b) UU PPh; PP 56/2015.

Public companies (perusahaan terbuka / Tbk) listed on IDX (BEI) get an **additional 3% reduction (effective 19%)** if **all** of the following are met for at least 183 days in the fiscal year: (1) ≥ 40% of paid-up shares listed and traded on IDX; (2) listed shares held by ≥ 300 parties; (3) each such party holds < 5%; (4) Form X.H.1-6 filed with OJK and DJP.

The 3% reduction stacks with Pasal 31E for the non-facility slice (19% on that slice) but does not further reduce the 11% facility slice.

**Conservative default:** Treat as private (22%). Reviewer must confirm IDX listing and Form X.H.1-6 filing before applying 19%.

### 3.4 Taxable Income (Penghasilan Kena Pajak)

```
PKP = Penghasilan Bruto − Deductible costs (Pasal 6) − Tax loss carry-forward (Pasal 6(2))
```

Tax losses may be carried forward **5 years** from the year the loss arose (Pasal 6(2) UU PPh); pioneer industries can get an extended period under tax holiday rules. Carry-back is not available.

### 3.5 Fiscal Reconciliation (Rekonsiliasi Fiskal)

PPh Badan is computed from the **commercial profit per the audited financial statements**, adjusted by: (+) non-deductible expenses under Pasal 9; (+) income previously excluded from book profit but taxable; (−) income subject to final tax (PPh Final, already separately taxed); (−) non-taxable income under Pasal 4(3); (±) timing differences (depreciation, provisions). Reported in SPT 1771 Lampiran I.

---

## Section 4 — Deductible vs Non-Deductible Expenses

### 4.1 The 3M Test — Pasal 6 UU PPh

An expense is deductible only if incurred to **obtain, collect, and maintain income** (*untuk mendapatkan, menagih, dan memelihara penghasilan* — the "3M" test). Pasal 6(1) lists principal categories:

| Category | Reference |
|---|---|
| Direct/indirect business costs (raw materials, salaries, rent, utilities, interest, royalties, travel, waste) | Pasal 6(1)(a) |
| Depreciation and amortisation (Pasal 11, 11A) | Pasal 6(1)(b) |
| Pension contributions to Menkeu-approved funds | Pasal 6(1)(c) |
| Losses on disposal of business assets | Pasal 6(1)(d) |
| Forex losses | Pasal 6(1)(e) |
| Approved domestic R&D | Pasal 6(1)(f) |
| Scholarship, apprenticeship, training | Pasal 6(1)(g) |
| Bad debts meeting Pasal 6(1)(h) conditions | Pasal 6(1)(h) |
| Donations under PP 93/2010 (disaster, R&D, education, sports, social infrastructure) | Pasal 6(1)(i)–(m) |

### 4.2 Non-Deductible Expenses — Pasal 9 UU PPh

The following are **not deductible** in computing taxable income:

| Item | Reference |
|---|---|
| Profit distributions to shareholders (dividends, share of profit) | Pasal 9(1)(a) |
| Costs for personal benefit of shareholders / partners / members | Pasal 9(1)(b) |
| Reserves and provisions, except specific allowances for banks, leasing, insurance, mining reclamation | Pasal 9(1)(c) |
| Personal life/health/accident insurance premiums (subject to PMK 66/2023 BIK rules) | Pasal 9(1)(d) |
| Benefits in kind (*natura/kenikmatan*) — now generally deductible to company, taxable to recipient post-UU HPP / PMK 66/2023 | Pasal 9(1)(e) |
| Excessive payments to shareholders / related parties (TP arm's-length test) | Pasal 9(1)(f) |
| Gifts and donations except qualifying Pasal 6(1)(i)–(m) and approved zakat | Pasal 9(1)(g) |
| Income tax itself (PPh Badan, PPh 25, PPh 29) | Pasal 9(1)(h) |
| Private living expenses of taxpayer or dependents | Pasal 9(1)(i) |
| Owner salary in sole prop / non-PT entity (does not apply to PT directors) | Pasal 9(1)(j) |
| Administrative sanctions and criminal fines | Pasal 9(1)(k) |

### 4.3 Benefit-in-Kind Rules — PMK 66/2023

From 1 July 2023, most BIK (*natura dan kenikmatan*) are **deductible to the employer** (a reversal of pre-UU HPP) and **taxable to the employee** through PPh 21 (see `id-payroll-pph21`).

Exceptions tax-free to the employee under PMK 66/2023: (1) food and beverages provided to all employees; (2) BIK in remote areas per Menkeu Decree; (3) BIK required by the nature of the work (safety equipment, uniforms); (4) APBN/APBD-funded BIK; (5) certain capped categories (religious/sports facilities, employee gifts up to IDR 3,000,000/employee/year).

**Conservative default:** Treat BIK as deductible to the employer AND taxable to the employee unless an exception clearly applies and is documented.

### 4.4 Depreciation and Amortisation — Pasal 11 and 11A

**Tangible asset groups** (PMK 96/2009 as amended):

| Group | Useful Life | Straight-Line | Declining-Balance |
|---|---|---|---|
| I (computers, office equipment) | 4 years | 25% | 50% |
| II (light vehicles, furniture) | 8 years | 12.5% | 25% |
| III (heavy machinery) | 16 years | 6.25% | 12.5% |
| IV (construction equipment, ships) | 20 years | 5% | 10% |
| Buildings — permanent | 20 years | 5% | n/a |
| Buildings — non-permanent | 10 years | 10% | n/a |

**Intangibles (Pasal 11A):** Mirror the four tangible groups; amortise straight-line or declining-balance.

**Election:** Straight-line vs declining-balance is elected per group and is binding. Land is not depreciated (Pasal 11(7)).

## Section 5 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 5.1 Tax Holiday — PMK 130/2020

**Available for:** Pioneer industries (industri pionir) — currently 18 sectors including basic metals, oil refining, petrochemicals, machinery, robotics, pharmaceuticals, and digital economy infrastructure.

**Benefit:** 100% PPh Badan reduction for 5–20 years (depending on investment scale from IDR 100 billion to over IDR 30 trillion), followed by a 50% reduction for 2 transitional years. Application via OSS coordinated with BKPM and DJP; holiday begins at commercial operation start.

**Conservative default:** Do not apply until the Decree of the Minister of Finance (KMK) is in hand. Reviewer must verify the KMK and commercial operation date.

### 5.2 Tax Allowance — PP 78/2019

For business fields and regions listed in PP 78/2019 attachments. Benefits: 30% investment allowance over 6 years (5%/year), accelerated depreciation, reduced WHT on dividends to foreign shareholders, extended loss carry-forward up to 10 years.

**Conservative default:** Apply only after the BKPM Decree is issued.

### 5.3 Super-Deduction R&D — PMK 153/2020

Up to **300% deduction** for qualifying domestic R&D in priority sectors (food, pharma, ICT, materials, transport, defence, energy, electronics). Base 100% is allowed under Pasal 6(1)(f); the additional up to 200% super-deduction requires a KMK.

**Conservative default:** Apply base 100% only. Apply super-deduction only after KMK is issued.

### 5.4 Super-Deduction Vocational Training — PMK 128/2019

Additional 100% deduction (200% total) on qualifying vocational training and apprenticeship costs. Requires OSS approval.

### 5.5 Investment Allowance for Labour-Intensive Industries — PMK 16/2020

60% investment allowance on tangible fixed-asset investment, spread over 6 years (10%/year).

### 5.6 KEK, Free Trade Zones, Bonded Zones

Special Economic Zones (KEK), Free Trade Zones (Batam, Bintan, Karimun), and Bonded Zones (Kawasan Berikat) carry sector-specific PPh, PPN, PPnBM, and customs facilities under PP 12/2020 and PP 41/2021. Flag to a specialist.

### 5.7 Director Remuneration Reasonableness

Director / komisaris salaries are deductible if ratified by RUPS, commercially reasonable, and subject to PPh 21 withholding. Excessive remuneration may be reclassified by DJP as a deemed dividend under Pasal 9(1)(f). Flag where remuneration is materially above market.

### 5.8 Bad Debt Write-Off — Pasal 6(1)(h)

Bad debts are deductible only if (i) recognised in the books, (ii) listed in a schedule submitted to DJP, and (iii) supported by recovery action (newspaper publication, court action, or written debtor acknowledgement). Banks and financial institutions follow separate rules.

---

## Section 6 — Monthly PPh 25 Installments

**Legislation:** Pasal 25 UU PPh; PMK 215/2018.

**Basic formula:**
```
Monthly PPh 25 = (Prior-Year PPh Badan − Prior-Year Tax Credits) / 12
```

Creditable prior-year items: PPh 22 (collection by certain parties), PPh 23 (services, royalties), PPh 24 (foreign tax credit). PPh 26 (WHT on payments to non-residents) is generally not creditable to a resident PT.

**First-year companies:** Estimate using annualised forecast taxable income.

**Adjustments:** Recalculated each year after the SPT 1771 is filed (new basis from May to April of the following installment year). Mid-year reduction requires DJP approval — up to a 25% reduction is permitted without proof per PMK 215/2018; larger reductions require supporting evidence.

**Payment:** 15th of the following month, via SSP / billing code through Coretax. No separate monthly SPT generally required.

**Late payment:** 2% per month, prorated daily, capped at 24 months (Pasal 9(2a) UU KUP).

**Conservative default:** Pay PPh 25 on time and in full. Do not advise installment reductions without confirmed DJP approval.

---

## Section 7 — Transfer Pricing

**Legislation:** Pasal 18 UU PPh; PMK 213/2016 (TP-Doc); PMK 22/2020 (TP general); **PMK 172/2023** (implementation of arm's-length principle and dispute resolution, effective 1 January 2024).

### 7.1 The Arm's-Length Principle — PKKU

Related-party transactions (*hubungan istimewa*, Pasal 18(4) UU PPh) must apply **Prinsip Kewajaran dan Kelaziman Usaha (PKKU)** — the Indonesian arm's-length principle. Five OECD methods (CUP, RPM, CPM, TNMM, Profit Split) plus valuation techniques for intangibles.

### 7.2 Related-Party Definition — Pasal 18(4)

A "special relationship" exists where: (1) one party owns ≥ 25% of the other directly or indirectly, or two parties share ≥ 25% common ownership; (2) one party controls the other through management or technology; (3) blood relations to the second degree or marriage to the first degree.

### 7.3 Documentation Thresholds — PMK 213/2016

TP documentation is required if **any** of the following applies in the fiscal year:

| Document | Threshold |
|---|---|
| **Master File & Local File** | Prior-year gross revenue > IDR 50B; OR related-party tangible-goods transactions > IDR 20B; OR related-party services / interest / royalty / other transactions > IDR 5B per category |
| **CbCR** | Ultimate parent of a group with consolidated revenue > IDR 11 trillion (~EUR 750M) |
| Related parties in preferential regimes (tax rate < 22%) | Documentation required regardless of value |

### 7.4 PMK 172/2023 Key Updates (effective 2024)

Clarifies the **ex-ante** pricing approach (support pricing at transaction time, not retrospectively); details guidance for intangibles, intra-group services (benefit test), financial transactions, and business restructuring; confirms MAP and APA routes; reinforces secondary adjustments where retained cash is treated as a constructive dividend.

### 7.5 Filing Mechanics

- **Master File / Local File:** must exist within **4 months after fiscal year-end**; submitted on DJP request during examination; summary statement filed with SPT 1771.
- **CbCR:** filed within 12 months of fiscal year-end via DJP's CbCR portal.
- **TP disclosure:** SPT 1771 Lampiran Khusus 3A / 3A-1 / 3A-2 — discloses related-party transactions and methods used.

**Conservative default:** If revenue > IDR 50B or any PMK 213/2016 threshold is crossed, flag TP documentation as mandatory. Treat undocumented related-party transactions as TP adjustment risk.

## Section 8 — Worked Example: Small PT with Pasal 31E Facility

**Facts:** PT Sumber Makmur (resident PT, fiscal year 2025 calendar).
- Gross turnover (peredaran bruto): **IDR 6,000,000,000**.
- Commercial profit before tax: IDR 1,560,000,000.
- Fiscal adjustments: + IDR 30,000,000 non-deductible entertainment (Pasal 9); + IDR 10,000,000 non-deductible private car; − IDR 100,000,000 bank interest already taxed via PPh Final.
- Tax credits: PPh 22 IDR 15,000,000; PPh 23 IDR 25,000,000; PPh 25 paid IDR 80,000,000.

**8.1 Taxable income (PKP):**
```
1,560,000,000 + 30,000,000 + 10,000,000 − 100,000,000 = IDR 1,500,000,000
```

**8.2 Apply Pasal 31E.** Turnover sits between IDR 4.8B and IDR 50B, so the facility applies to a proportional slice:
```
Facility slice     = (4,800,000,000 / 6,000,000,000) × 1,500,000,000 = IDR 1,200,000,000
Non-facility slice = 1,500,000,000 − 1,200,000,000                   = IDR   300,000,000
```

**8.3 PPh Badan:**
```
11% × 1,200,000,000 = IDR 132,000,000
22% ×   300,000,000 = IDR  66,000,000
Total PPh Badan      IDR 198,000,000
```

**8.4 PPh 29 (annual underpayment):**
```
198,000,000 − 15,000,000 − 25,000,000 − 80,000,000 = IDR 78,000,000
```
Pay IDR 78,000,000 before filing SPT 1771, no later than **30 April 2026**.

**8.5 2026 monthly PPh 25:**
```
(198,000,000 − 15,000,000 − 25,000,000) / 12 = IDR 13,166,667 per month
```
Effective from the May 2026 installment (January–April 2026 continues on the 2024-based amount until the 2025 SPT is filed).

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply tax holiday, tax allowance, or super-deduction without a KMK / BKPM Decree in hand.
- NEVER ignore Pasal 31E when turnover ≤ IDR 50B — the facility is automatic.
- NEVER use current-year profit as the PPh 25 basis — installments are prior-year based.
- NEVER include PPh Final income in the PPh Badan computation — reconcile it out.
- NEVER deduct income tax itself (PPh Badan, 25, 29) — Pasal 9(1)(h).
- NEVER deduct dividends — Pasal 9(1)(a).
- NEVER deduct administrative or criminal fines — Pasal 9(1)(k).
- NEVER treat related-party transactions as arm's length without supporting analysis.
- NEVER skip TP documentation when PMK 213/2016 thresholds are crossed.
- NEVER advise late filing or late payment as a strategy — 2%/month surcharge is severe.
- NEVER stack PPh Final UMKM 0.5% with Pasal 31E — they are alternative regimes.
- NEVER apply Pasal 17(2b) 19% rate without confirming the 40%/300-party/<5%/183-day conditions and the X.H.1-6 filing.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — always label as estimates pending reviewer sign-off.
