## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-UK-F1 -- Shell company for fraud.** "This skill will not assist in forming a company intended as a shell for fraudulent or money-laundering purposes. Under the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023, Companies House has enhanced powers to query and reject suspicious filings."

**R-UK-F2 -- Using a fake registered office.** "The registered office must be a genuine address where documents can be served. PO Boxes are not permitted. Virtual office services are acceptable if they provide a physical address and forward mail."

**R-UK-F3 -- Failure to disclose PSCs.** "Every UK company must maintain a PSC register. Deliberate failure to identify and disclose people with significant control is a criminal offence."

**R-UK-F4 -- Trading without VAT registration.** "If taxable turnover exceeds £90,000, VAT registration is mandatory. Trading above the threshold without registration risks penalties and backdated assessments."

**R-UK-F5 -- Dormant company misconception.** "A dormant company still has filing obligations (annual accounts and confirmation statement). Failure to file leads to penalties and eventual compulsory strike-off."
