---

## Section 4 -- Expense Classification

### HMRC Self-Assessment Categories (SA103)

For sole traders, HMRC groups expenses on form SA103:

|---|---|---|
| Box 17 | Cost of goods sold | 5000–5300 |
| Box 18 | Construction industry subcontractor costs | 5200 |

- Business entertaining (clients) — disallowed for income tax/CT
- Personal expenses — not wholly and exclusively for trade
- Fines and penalties — public policy
- Capital expenditure — must go through capital allowances
- General provisions — only specific bad debts are allowable

---

## Section 5 -- Asset vs Expense Thresholds

### Capital Allowances (Not Accounting Depreciation)

UK tax does NOT use accounting depreciation — it adds back book depreciation and substitutes capital allowances.

| Allowance | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) | 100% up to £1,000,000 | Most plant & machinery; NOT cars |
| First Year Allowance (40%) | 40% | From 1 Jan 2026 for unincorporated businesses |
| Full Expensing | 100% | Companies only, new P&M (from April 2023) |
| Main Pool WDA | 18% reducing balance (14% from April 2026) | Items not covered by AIA |
| Special Rate Pool WDA | 6% reducing balance | Long-life assets, integral features, high-emission cars |
| Cars: CO₂ ≤ 0 g/km | 100% FYA | Electric/zero-emission |
| Cars: CO₂ 1–50 g/km | 18% main pool | |
| Cars: CO₂ > 50 g/km | 6% special rate | |
| Small Pools Allowance | Write off pool balance ≤ £1,000 | |

### Accounting Depreciation (Book Purposes)

For FRS 105/102 accounts, depreciate over useful life:

| Asset Class | Typical Book Rate | Method |
|---|---|---|
| Freehold property | 2% | Straight-line |
| Leasehold improvements | Over lease term | Straight-line |
| Plant and machinery | 15–25% | Reducing balance or straight-line |
| Fixtures and fittings | 15–20% | Straight-line |
| Motor vehicles | 25% | Reducing balance |
| Computer equipment | 33% | Straight-line (3-year life) |

### Low-Value Items

No statutory de minimis in UK GAAP, but common practice: items under £100–£500 expensed directly. Firms should set and document their own capitalisation policy.

## Section 9 -- Micro-Entity / Small Business Simplifications

### FRS 105 Simplifications (Micro-Entities)

| Feature | Simplification |
|---|---|
| Financial statements | Balance sheet + P&L only (no cash flow, no directors' report) |
| Disclosures | Minimal — only advances/credits to directors, guarantees |
| Revaluation | Prohibited — historical cost only |
| Deferred tax | Not recognised |
| Financial instruments | All at cost or amortised cost |
| Leases | All treated as operating leases |
| Government grants | Recognised when receivable |
| Filing | Abbreviated accounts at Companies House (P&L not public) |

### Qualifying Thresholds (from 6 April 2025)

| Regime | Turnover | Balance Sheet | Employees |
|---|---|---|---|
| Micro-entity (FRS 105) | ≤ £1,000,000 | ≤ £500,000 | ≤ 10 |
| Small company (FRS 102 s.1A) | ≤ £15,000,000 | ≤ £7,500,000 | ≤ 50 |

### Cash Basis for Sole Traders

From 2024-25 onwards, cash basis is the **default** for sole traders and partnerships, with **no income cap** following the reform. Taxpayers may elect out via a formal election to use the accruals basis. Under cash basis:
- No debtors/creditors accounting
- No depreciation (capital items expensed — except cars)
- Interest expense capped at £500
- Loss relief restricted to current trade only

### MTD ITSA — From 6 April 2026

Sole traders and landlords with **gross income > £50,000 in 2024-25** are mandated into MTD ITSA from **6 April 2026**. This is the largest bookkeeping change in the 3-year window:
- Quarterly updates (digital records of income and expenses) submitted via MTD-compatible software
- End-of-period statement and final declaration replace the traditional SA return for in-scope taxpayers
- Digital record-keeping requirement — paper ledgers no longer sufficient for in-scope businesses
- Phase 2 (>£30,000) follows from 6 April 2027

Bookkeeping software choice and chart-of-accounts mapping should be MTD-ITSA-ready for any client expected to cross the £50,000 threshold for 2024-25.

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### Income Tax (Self-Assessment SA103/SA105)

- Bookkeeping P&L feeds directly into SA103 (self-employment) or SA105 (property)
- Add back: entertaining, depreciation, personal element of mixed expenses
- Deduct: capital allowances (in place of depreciation), trading losses brought forward
- Cash basis taxpayers report income/expenses as per bank, with no accruals adjustments

### Corporation Tax (CT600)

- Start with accounting profit per FRS 105/102
- Adjust: add back book depreciation, non-deductible entertainment, general provisions
- Deduct: capital allowances, R&D enhanced deduction if eligible
- GAAR / transfer pricing for connected parties

### VAT Return (Making Tax Digital)

| BAS Box | Description | CoA Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| Box 1 | VAT due on sales | 2202 (output VAT) |
| Box 2 | VAT due on acquisitions from EU | 2202 |
| Box 3 | Total VAT due (Box 1 + 2) | Calculated |
| Box 4 | VAT reclaimed on purchases | 2201 (input VAT) |
| Box 5 | Net VAT to pay or reclaim | 2200 (control) |
| Box 6 | Total sales excl. VAT | 4000–4004 |
| Box 7 | Total purchases excl. VAT | 5000–5300 + 6000–6600 |
| Box 8 | Supplies of goods to EU | 4004 (subset) |
| Box 9 | Acquisitions from EU | 5000 (subset) |

### Payroll (RTI — Real Time Information)

- Report PAYE/NIC to HMRC on or before each pay date via Full Payment Submission (FPS)
- Employer Payment Summary (EPS) for recoverable amounts
- Nominal 6100 (gross wages) + 6110 (employer NIC) + 6120 (employer pension) = total staff cost
