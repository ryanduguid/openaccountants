### 1.1 Three-year threshold table -- all plans

| Plan | Rate | 2024-25 Threshold | 2025-26 Threshold | 2026-27 Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan 1 | 9% | £24,990 | £26,065 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 2 | 9% | £27,295 | £28,470 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 4 | 9% | £31,395 | £32,745 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 5 | 9% | £25,000 | £25,000 (frozen by SLC) | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Postgraduate Loan | 6% | £21,000 | £21,000 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |

**Reviewer note on 2026-27:** Verify the 2026-27 thresholds when HMRC announces them (typically published in the year preceding the tax year via SLC and HMRC guidance). Do not commit to figures until officially published.

**Plan eligibility summary:**

- **Plan 1** -- pre-2012 England/Wales undergrads; Northern Ireland students (all years); Scotland/NI undergrads pre-2024.
- **Plan 2** -- England/Wales 2012-2023 undergrads.
- **Plan 4** -- Scotland 2024+ (and migrated Scottish ICR borrowers).
- **Plan 5** -- England 2023+ undergrads (collections began April 2026).
- **Postgraduate Loan (PGL)** -- England/Wales master's and doctoral loans.

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown plan type | STOP -- do not guess; direct client to SLC |
| Unknown total income | Ask -- threshold comparison requires total relevant income |
| Unknown PAYE deductions | Ask -- PAYE offset affects SA balance |
| Unknown unearned income | Ask if total unearned > £2,000 (below £2,000 = excluded) |
| Unknown overseas status | Flag for reviewer -- SLC applies country-specific thresholds |
| 2026-27 threshold unknown | Flag "verify when HMRC announces" |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- plan type(s), tax year, and total taxable income (all sources).

**Recommended** -- P60 or payslips showing PAYE student loan deductions, bank statements showing SA payments, SLC online account balance.

**Ideal** -- complete SA100 return data, SLC repayment schedule, confirmation of plan type from SLC.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-UK-SL-1 -- Plan type unknown.** *Trigger:* client does not know plan type. *Message:* "Do not guess the plan type. Direct the client to check at repaymentplan.studentloanrepayment.co.uk or call SLC directly."

**R-UK-SL-2 -- Overseas borrower.** *Trigger:* client lives outside the UK for 3+ months. *Message:* "SLC conducts an overseas income assessment with country-specific thresholds. Do not use UK thresholds. Escalate to SLC directly."

**R-UK-SL-3 -- Loan cancellation or SLC error.** *Trigger:* client disputes loan balance or believes SLC has made an error. *Message:* "Loan balance disputes and administrative errors must be resolved directly with SLC. Out of scope."

**R-UK-SL-4 -- 2026-27 thresholds not yet published.** *Trigger:* a 2026-27 computation requires a specific threshold that HMRC has not yet announced. *Message:* "The 2026-27 thresholds are published annually by HMRC and may not yet be confirmed. Flag for reviewer and verify before finalising any computation."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to student loan repayments.

### 3.1 Student loan repayments via Self Assessment

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT | EXCLUDE -- combined SA payment | Student loan repayment is embedded in the SA payment alongside income tax and NIC; cannot isolate from bank statement |
| HMRC, HM REVENUE & CUSTOMS | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | Same -- student loan component included |
| SA PAYMENT, SA BALANCING | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | Same |

### 3.2 Direct SLC payments (voluntary overpayments or overseas)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SLC, STUDENT LOANS COMPANY | EXCLUDE -- student loan repayment | Direct payment to SLC (voluntary overpayment or overseas repayment) |
| STUDENT LOAN, STUDENT LOANS | EXCLUDE -- student loan | Generic reference |
| ERUDIO STUDENT LOANS | EXCLUDE -- legacy loan | Pre-1998 mortgage-style loans (now managed by Erudio) |

### 3.3 PAYE deductions (visible on payslips, not bank statement)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARY, WAGES (incoming credit) | Not a student loan payment | Student loan deduction already made at source by employer -- net salary shown on bank statement is post-deduction |

### 3.4 SLC refunds

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SLC REFUND, STUDENT LOANS REFUND | EXCLUDE -- refund of overpayment | SLC refunds overpaid amounts directly |

---

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement classifications for a hypothetical UK self-employed graphic designer with a Plan 2 loan and Postgraduate Loan.

### Example 1 -- SA balancing payment (includes student loan)

**Input line:**
`31.01.2027 ; HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT ; DEBIT ; BALANCING PAYMENT ; -5,800.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT" (pattern 3.1). This is the 31 January balancing payment. Includes income tax + Class 4 NIC + student loan repayment combined. Cannot isolate student loan component from bank statement. Need SA302 for breakdown.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- combined SA payment. Request SA302 for student loan component.

### Example 2 -- Voluntary overpayment direct to SLC

**Input line:**
`15.05.2026 ; STUDENT LOANS COMPANY ; DEBIT ; VOLUNTARY OVERPAYMENT ; -500.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "STUDENT LOANS COMPANY" (pattern 3.2). This is a voluntary overpayment made directly to SLC. Not deductible. Not part of SA. Reduce outstanding loan balance.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- voluntary student loan overpayment. Not tax-deductible.

### Example 3 -- Employment salary (PAYE deduction already made)

**Input line:**
`28.02.2026 ; DESIGN AGENCY LTD ; CREDIT ; FEB SALARY ; +2,400.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Employment income. If the client is on Plan 2, the employer has already deducted student loan repayments from gross salary before paying the net amount. The £2,400 is post-deduction. This is NOT a student loan payment visible on the bank statement.

**Classification:** NOT a student loan payment. PAYE deduction already made at source.

### Example 4 -- SLC refund

**Input line:**
`20.06.2026 ; SLC REFUND ; CREDIT ; OVERPAYMENT REFUND ; +320.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "SLC REFUND" (pattern 3.4). Client overpaid and SLC is refunding. Not taxable income. Not a student loan payment.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- refund from SLC. Not taxable.

### Example 5 -- Payment on account (includes student loan)

**Input line:**
`31.07.2026 ; HMRC ; DEBIT ; 2ND PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT ; -2,900.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "HMRC" (pattern 3.1). Second payment on account. Includes income tax + Class 4 NIC + student loan POA. Cannot split from bank statement.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SA payment on account. Request SA302 for student loan component.

### Example 6 -- Erudio legacy loan payment

**Input line:**
`01.04.2026 ; ERUDIO STUDENT LOANS ; DEBIT ; MONTHLY REPAYMENT ; -180.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "ERUDIO STUDENT LOANS" (pattern 3.2). This is a pre-1998 mortgage-style student loan managed by Erudio. Separate from the income-contingent plans. Monthly fixed repayments.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- legacy student loan repayment. Not tax-deductible.

## Section 4A -- Three-year worked example: Plan 2 + PGL SA filer

Hypothetical: a self-employed UK consultant with both a Plan 2 undergraduate loan and a Postgraduate Loan. Trading profits are the only relevant income (no employment, no unearned income above £2,000). Demonstrates how the SA deduction shifts as thresholds rise (2026-27 figures pending HMRC confirmation).

Assume trading profits of **£42,000** in each of the three years (held constant to isolate the threshold effect).

### Year 1 -- 2024-25

| Component | Threshold | Income above | Rate | Repayment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan 2 | £27,295 | £14,705 | 9% | £1,323.45 |
| PGL | £21,000 | £21,000 | 6% | £1,260.00 |
| **Total via SA** | | | | **£2,583.45** |

### Year 2 -- 2025-26

| Component | Threshold | Income above | Rate | Repayment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan 2 | £28,470 | £13,530 | 9% | £1,217.70 |
| PGL | £21,000 | £21,000 | 6% | £1,260.00 |
| **Total via SA** | | | | **£2,477.70** |

Change from 2024-25: **down £105.75** (Plan 2 threshold rose by £1,175 -> £1,175 x 9% = £105.75 less on Plan 2; PGL threshold unchanged).

### Year 3 -- 2026-27

Plan 2 threshold: **TBC -- HMRC publishes annually.**
PGL threshold: **TBC -- HMRC publishes annually** (frozen at £21,000 for two consecutive years; reviewer should verify whether the freeze continues).

**Provisional behaviour (do not finalise until thresholds published):**
- If Plan 2 threshold rises again, the Plan 2 component falls further.
- If PGL threshold is unfrozen and rises, the PGL component falls; if it stays at £21,000, PGL repayment remains £1,260.00.
- Flag in working paper: "2026-27 thresholds pending HMRC announcement -- verify before filing."

**Key takeaway:** With constant profits of £42,000, the SA deduction shifts modestly year-on-year as Plan 2 thresholds rise. The PGL component is currently insensitive to threshold movement because PGL is frozen. The 2026-27 figures cannot be finalised until HMRC publishes them.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

### Rule 1 -- Single plan formula

```
Repayment = (total_relevant_income - threshold) x rate
```

If result is negative, repayment = £0.

### Rule 2 -- What income counts

| Income Type | Included? |
|---|---|
| Self-employment profits (SA103) | Yes |
| Employment income (SA100) | Yes (but PAYE deductions offset) |
| Savings income | Yes, if total unearned > £2,000 |
| Dividend income | Yes, if total unearned > £2,000 |
| Rental income | Yes, if total unearned > £2,000 |
| Pension income | Yes |
| Capital gains | No |

### Rule 3 -- PAYE offset

```
Total repayment due = (total_relevant_income - threshold) x rate
Less: PAYE deductions already made = Balance due via Self Assessment
```

If PAYE exceeds total due, client claims refund from SLC (not HMRC).

### Rule 4 -- Multiple plans

Each plan calculated separately with its own threshold. Both apply simultaneously.

| Combination (2025-26 figures) | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Plan 2 + Postgraduate Loan | 9% above £28,470 AND 6% above £21,000 |
| Plan 1 + Postgraduate Loan | 9% above £26,065 AND 6% above £21,000 |
| Sequential (Plan 1 then Plan 2) | Plan 1 repaid first, then Plan 2 begins |

Maximum combined rate: 15% where both thresholds exceeded.

### Rule 5 -- NOT tax-deductible

Student loan repayments are NOT business expenses. Cannot be deducted from trading profits.

### Rule 6 -- Payment schedule (via Self Assessment)

Same as income tax: 31 Jan (1st POA), 31 Jul (2nd POA), 31 Jan (balancing). POAs = 50% of prior year student loan SA liability.

### Rule 7 -- Write-off periods

| Plan | Write-Off |
|---|---|
| Plan 1 (pre-Sep 2006) | Age 65 |
| Plan 1 (post-Sep 2006) | 25 years after first repayment |
| Plan 2 | 30 years |
| Plan 4 | 30 years (or age 65 for older borrowers) |
| Plan 5 | 40 years |
| Postgraduate Loan | 30 years |

### Rule 8 -- Plan 5 timing

Plan 5 collections began April 2026. For 2024-25 SA, no Plan 5 repayment is due. For 2025-26 SA, no Plan 5 repayment is due either (collections only begin in tax year 2026-27). From 2026-27 onwards, Plan 5 repayments apply at 9% above the published threshold.

### Rule 9 -- Unearned income rule

Total unearned income (savings + dividends + rent) only counts if it exceeds £2,000/year.

### Rule 10 -- Threshold publication timing

HMRC publishes student loan thresholds annually, typically in the months preceding the start of the tax year (April). When a threshold for an upcoming year is not yet announced, flag for reviewer rather than estimating.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

### T2-1 -- Multiple plan interaction

**Trigger:** Client has more than one plan type simultaneously.
**Action:** Confirm plan types with SLC before computing. Each plan uses its own threshold.

### T2-2 -- Overseas earnings

**Trigger:** Client lives outside UK for 3+ months.
**Action:** SLC applies country-specific thresholds. Do not use UK thresholds. Escalate.

### T2-3 -- Approaching write-off date

**Trigger:** Client is within 2 years of write-off.
**Action:** Advise against voluntary overpayments. Flag for reviewer to confirm exact write-off date with SLC.

### T2-4 -- Mid-year overseas move

**Trigger:** Client was UK-resident part of the year, then moved abroad.
**Action:** UK SA covers UK-resident period; SLC overseas assessment covers the rest. Flag for reviewer.

### T2-5 -- Early repayment decision

**Trigger:** Client asks whether to make voluntary overpayments.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Consider interest rates, write-off proximity, and opportunity cost.

### T2-6 -- 2026-27 threshold not yet published

**Trigger:** Computation requires a 2026-27 threshold that HMRC has not announced.
**Action:** Use the 2025-26 figure as a placeholder, clearly label "PROVISIONAL -- 2026-27 threshold pending HMRC announcement", and flag for reviewer to revisit once HMRC publishes.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How student loan payments appear on UK bank statements

**Via Self Assessment (most common for self-employed):**
- Combined with income tax and NIC in a single HMRC debit
- Cannot identify student loan component from bank statement alone
- Need SA302 tax calculation for breakdown
- Timing: 31 Jan and 31 Jul

**Direct to SLC (voluntary overpayments):**
- Description: "STUDENT LOANS COMPANY", "SLC"
- Any timing (client-initiated)
- Clearly identifiable as student loan specific

**PAYE deductions (employed clients with additional self-employment):**
- Not visible on bank statement -- deducted from gross salary before net payment
- Visible on payslips and P60 only

**Key identification tips:**
1. For self-employed, student loan is almost always embedded in SA payments
2. The SA302 is the only reliable source for the student loan component
3. Direct SLC payments are voluntary overpayments
4. SLC refunds appear as credits from SLC

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement:

1. **Identify HMRC SA payments** -- these contain the student loan component (if any)
2. **Look for direct SLC payments** -- these are voluntary overpayments
3. **Flag:** "Student loan repayments for self-employed are collected through Self Assessment and combined with income tax and NIC in a single HMRC payment. The bank statement cannot isolate the student loan component. Please provide the SA302 tax calculation and confirm the plan type with SLC."

---

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### Thresholds and rates -- three-year view

| Plan | Rate | 2024-25 | 2025-26 | 2026-27 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Plan 1 | 9% | £24,990 | £26,065 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 2 | 9% | £27,295 | £28,470 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 4 | 9% | £31,395 | £32,745 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Plan 5 | 9% | £25,000 | £25,000 (frozen) | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |
| Postgraduate Loan | 6% | £21,000 | £21,000 | TBC -- HMRC publishes annually |

### Test suite (2025-26 figures unless stated)

**Test 1:** Plan 2, self-employed, income £35,000. -> (£35,000 - £28,470) x 9% = £587.70.

**Test 2:** Plan 1, self-employed, income £60,000. -> (£60,000 - £26,065) x 9% = £3,054.15.

**Test 3:** Plan 4, self-employed, income £40,000. -> (£40,000 - £32,745) x 9% = £652.95.

**Test 4:** Plan 5 (2026-27 onwards), income £30,000. -> (£30,000 - threshold) x 9%. With 2025-26 placeholder threshold £25,000: £450.00. Flag 2026-27 threshold as TBC.

**Test 5:** PGL only, income £28,000. -> (£28,000 - £21,000) x 6% = £420.00.

**Test 6:** Plan 2 + PGL, income £45,000 (2025-26). -> Plan 2 = £1,487.70, PGL = £1,440.00. Total = £2,927.70.

**Test 7:** Plan 2, income £25,000. -> Below threshold. Repayment = £0.

**Test 8:** Plan 1, employed £28,000 (PAYE deductions made) + self-employed £12,000. Total £40,000 (2025-26). -> Total = £1,254.15. Less PAYE £174.15. Balance via SA = £1,080.00.

**Test 9 (3-year sensitivity):** Plan 2 + PGL, profits £42,000 each year.
- 2024-25: Plan 2 £1,323.45 + PGL £1,260.00 = £2,583.45.
- 2025-26: Plan 2 £1,217.70 + PGL £1,260.00 = £2,477.70.
- 2026-27: Provisional pending HMRC publication of thresholds.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER guess the client's plan type
- NEVER include capital gains in the repayment income calculation
- NEVER treat student loan repayments as tax-deductible
- NEVER apply UK thresholds to overseas borrowers
- NEVER advise voluntary overpayments without checking write-off proximity
- NEVER combine plan thresholds -- each plan has its own separate calculation
- NEVER assume PAYE deductions have been made -- verify with payslips or P60
- NEVER present figures without noting that SLC manages the loan balance and interest
- NEVER finalise 2026-27 figures without confirming HMRC has published the thresholds
- NEVER include unearned income if total unearned is £2,000 or less
