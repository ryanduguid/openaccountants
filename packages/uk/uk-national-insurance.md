# UK National Insurance -- Comprehensive Skill v3.0

## Section 1 -- Quick reference (3-year comparison)

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.** This skill covers three tax years: the **Prior year (2024-25)**, the **Current year (2025-26)**, and the **Forthcoming year (2026-27)**.

| Field | 2024-25 (Prior) | 2025-26 (Current) | 2026-27 (Forthcoming) |

| Tax Authority | HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) | | |
| Currency | GBP only | | |
| Contributor | Open Accountants | | |
| Validated by | Pending -- requires sign-off by a UK-qualified practitioner | | |
| Validation date | Pending | | |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown tax year | Ask -- rates differ materially between 2024-25, 2025-26, and 2026-27 (especially employer NIC) |
| Unknown employment status | Ask -- dual status affects annual maximum cap |
| Unknown profit level | Do not compute -- profits are required |
| Unknown whether client wants voluntary Class 2 | Recommend if profits below SPT and client needs qualifying years |
| Unknown state pension record | Flag for reviewer |
| Unknown age (state pension age) | Ask -- over state pension age = no Class 4 |
| Unknown payroll size for Employer NIC | Ask -- Employment Allowance depends on prior-year secondary Class 1 < £100k and connected-company rules |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- tax year, employment status (sole self-employed, employed, employer, or dual), and net self-employment profits (for Class 4) or gross payroll (for Class 1).

**Recommended** -- bank statements showing HMRC Self Assessment / PAYE payments, prior year SA302 tax calculation, P60/P11D from employment, state pension record printout.

**Ideal** -- complete SA100/SA103 return data, FPS submissions for PAYE clients, NI record from gov.uk.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-UK-NIC-1 -- Non-resident or overseas client.** *Trigger:* client is non-UK resident or has complex international arrangements. *Message:* "NIC for non-resident or overseas clients involves complex rules under EU/bilateral social security agreements. Escalate to a qualified UK practitioner."

**R-UK-NIC-2 -- Special categories.** *Trigger:* client is a mariner, share fisherman, volunteer development worker, or religious minister. *Message:* "Special NIC provisions apply to this category. Escalate to a qualified practitioner."

**R-UK-NIC-3 -- Deferment computation.** *Trigger:* client requests Class 1 deferment across multiple employments. *Message:* "Class 1 deferment requires HMRC application (form CA72A) and case-specific earnings analysis. Flag for reviewer."

**R-UK-NIC-4 -- Connected-company Employment Allowance.** *Trigger:* employer is part of a group of connected companies. *Message:* "Only one company in a connected group can claim the Employment Allowance. Escalate."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to NIC. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference. NIC payments always EXCLUDE from any VAT classification -- they are statutory personal obligations (Class 2/4) or employer payroll obligations (Class 1 employer).

### 3.1 HMRC Self Assessment payments (include Class 4 + optional Class 2)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HMRC, HM REVENUE, HM REVENUE & CUSTOMS | EXCLUDE -- tax/NIC payment | Self Assessment payments include income tax + Class 4 NIC + voluntary Class 2 |
| HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | Combined tax and NIC |
| HMRC NDDS, HMRC SHIPLEY | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | HMRC processing centres |
| SELF ASSESSMENT, SA PAYMENT | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | Generic SA reference |

### 3.2 Class 2 direct debits (voluntary -- separate from SA)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HMRC NIC, HMRC CLASS 2 | EXCLUDE -- voluntary Class 2 | Monthly or quarterly direct debit for Class 2 |
| NATIONAL INSURANCE, NAT INS | EXCLUDE -- NIC payment | Generic NI reference |
| NIC DIRECT DEBIT, NIC D/D | EXCLUDE -- Class 2 DD | Voluntary Class 2 via direct debit |

### 3.3 HMRC PAYE payments (includes Class 1 employee + employer)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HMRC PAYE, PAYE NIC, HMRC CUMBERNAULD | EXCLUDE -- PAYE payment | Combined PAYE income tax + Class 1 employee + Class 1 employer + Apprenticeship Levy |
| 1025 (followed by UTR) | EXCLUDE -- SA payment | HMRC Self Assessment payment reference format (1025 + 10-digit UTR) |

### 3.4 Student loan and other SA components (NOT NIC)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| STUDENT LOAN, SLC | EXCLUDE -- student loan repayment | Not NIC -- see uk-student-loan-repayment skill |
| HMRC (large combined payment) | EXCLUDE -- combined SA | May include income tax + Class 4 + Class 2 + student loan; cannot split from bank statement alone |

### 3.5 Employer Class 1 (payroll context)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARY, WAGES (incoming credit) | Not self-employed NIC | Employment income -- Class 1 deducted at source by employer |
| EMPLOYER NIC | Employer's Class 1 obligation | 13.8% (2024-25) or 15% (2025-26 / 2026-27) on earnings above ST |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Self Assessment balancing payment (combined tax + NIC)

**Input line:**
`31.01.2027 ; HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT ; DEBIT ; SA BALANCING PAYMENT ; -4,200.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** Matches "HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT" (pattern 3.1). This is the 31 January balancing payment for tax year 2025-26. Includes income tax, Class 4 NIC, and possibly Class 2 voluntary. Cannot split NIC from income tax on the bank statement alone. Exclude from VAT. The SA302 tax calculation will show the NIC breakdown.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SA payment (combined tax and NIC). Request SA302 to determine NIC component.

### Example 2 -- Payment on account (31 July)

**Input line:**
`31.07.2026 ; HMRC NDDS ; DEBIT ; PAYMENT ON ACCOUNT ; -2,100.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** Matches "HMRC NDDS" (pattern 3.1). This is the second payment on account for 2025-26, due 31 July 2026. Includes 50% of prior year Class 4 liability and income tax. Exclude from VAT.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SA payment on account.

### Example 3 -- Voluntary Class 2 direct debit

**Input line:**
`15.03.2026 ; HMRC NIC ; DEBIT ; CLASS 2 NIC MAR ; -15.17 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** Matches "HMRC NIC" (pattern 3.2). Amount approximately £3.50/week x 4.33 weeks = £15.17 monthly. Voluntary Class 2 payment via direct debit. Client has profits below SPT and is paying voluntarily for state pension qualifying years.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- voluntary Class 2 NIC. Not deductible from profits (Class 2 is not a trading expense).

### Example 4 -- Employment salary credit (not NIC)

**Input line:**
`28.02.2026 ; ACME LTD SALARY ; CREDIT ; FEB SALARY ; +3,200.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** This is employment income received. Class 1 NIC has already been deducted by the employer at source. This is NOT a self-employment NIC payment.

**Classification:** NOT NIC -- employment income. Class 1 deducted at source.

### Example 5 -- Large SA payment (combined with student loan)

**Input line:**
`31.01.2027 ; HM REVENUE & CUSTOMS ; DEBIT ; SELF ASSESSMENT ; -8,500.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** Matches "HM REVENUE & CUSTOMS" (pattern 3.1). Large SA payment that likely combines income tax + Class 4 NIC + possibly Class 2 + student loan repayment. Cannot split components from bank statement. Need SA302 for breakdown.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- combined SA payment. Request SA302 for NIC/tax/student loan split.

### Example 6 -- HMRC refund (overpayment)

**Input line:**
`15.04.2027 ; HMRC ; CREDIT ; SA REPAYMENT ; +650.00 ; GBP`

**Reasoning:** This is a CREDIT from HMRC -- a repayment of overpaid SA (may include overpaid NIC). Exclude from VAT.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SA refund. Not taxable income. Request SA302 for breakdown.

### Example 7 -- Employer NIC impact: 2024-25 vs 2025-26 (side-by-side)

**Scenario:** A small employer pays one employee a gross salary of **£35,000** per year. Show the employer Class 1 NIC cost in 2024-25 (13.8% / ST £9,100) versus 2025-26 (15% / ST £5,000), and net of Employment Allowance.

| Component | 2024-25 (Prior) | 2025-26 (Current) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross salary | £35,000.00 | £35,000.00 |
| Secondary Threshold (ST) | £9,100 | £5,000 |
| Earnings above ST | £25,900 | £30,000 |
| Employer NIC rate | 13.8% | 15% |
| **Gross employer NIC** | **£3,574.20** | **£4,500.00** |
| Employment Allowance offset (single-director companies excluded) | up to £5,000 | up to £10,500 |
| **Employer NIC after Employment Allowance** (if eligible) | **£0** (£3,574.20 fully absorbed) | **£0** (£4,500.00 fully absorbed) |
| **Employer NIC if NOT eligible for EA** | **£3,574.20** | **£4,500.00** |

**Real-world impact:**
- For an **ineligible** employer (e.g. single-director company with no other employees on payroll, or a connected-company group that already claimed elsewhere), the cost rises by **£925.80 (+25.9%)** for a £35k employee from 2024-25 to 2025-26 -- driven by both the rate increase (13.8% -> 15%) and the ST reduction (£9,100 -> £5,000).
- For an **eligible** small employer, the doubled Employment Allowance (£5,000 -> £10,500) absorbs the full increase and may shield additional headcount.
- Worked check, 2025-26: (£35,000 - £5,000) x 15% = £30,000 x 0.15 = £4,500.00 ✓.
- Worked check, 2024-25: (£35,000 - £9,100) x 13.8% = £25,900 x 0.138 = £3,574.20 ✓.

**Reviewer flag:** Confirm Employment Allowance eligibility (employer's secondary Class 1 in the prior tax year was below £100,000, not a single-director-only company, and not the connected company in a group that already claims).

### Example 8 -- Self-employed Class 4 across 3 years (same £30,000 profit)

| Year | Profits | Class 4 calc | Class 4 NIC |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2024-25 | £30,000 | (£30,000 - £12,570) x 6% | £1,045.80 |
| 2025-26 | £30,000 | (£30,000 - £12,570) x 6% | £1,045.80 |
| 2026-27 | £30,000 | (£30,000 - £12,570) x 6% | £1,045.80 |

Class 4 rates and thresholds are unchanged across all three years. Class 2 treated as paid (profits > SPT) in all years -- no voluntary payment needed.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules (per year)

### Rule 1 -- Class 1 employee formula (all three years -- unchanged)

```
Class 1 (employee) = max(0, min(earnings, UEL) - PT) x 8% + max(earnings - UEL, 0) x 2%
PT = £12,570/yr, UEL = £50,270/yr (frozen through 2027-28)
```

### Rule 2 -- Class 1 employer formula (rate and threshold CHANGE in 2025-26)

```
2024-25: Employer NIC = max(0, earnings - £9,100) x 13.8%
2025-26: Employer NIC = max(0, earnings - £5,000) x 15%
2026-27: Employer NIC = max(0, earnings - £5,000) x 15%    (unchanged from 2025-26)
```

Reduce by Employment Allowance (capped at the lesser of secondary Class 1 due in year and the allowance):
- 2024-25: up to £5,000
- 2025-26: up to £10,500
- 2026-27: up to £10,500

### Rule 3 -- Class 2 abolished from 6 April 2024

For all three years (2024-25, 2025-26, 2026-27): self-employed with profits >= SPT are treated as paid automatically (zero-rate credit). No action needed. Profits < SPT: may pay voluntarily (£3.45/wk in 2024-25; £3.50/wk in 2025-26; TBC for 2026-27) to get a qualifying year.

### Rule 4 -- Class 4 formula (unchanged across all three years)

```
Class 4 NIC = (min(profits, £50,270) - £12,570) x 6% + max(profits - £50,270, 0) x 2%
```

If profits <= £12,570, Class 4 = £0. Rates were reduced from 9% to 6% from 6 April 2024 and have not changed since.

### Rule 5 -- Class 4 is based on CURRENT year profits

Unlike Malta SSC, UK Class 4 NIC is calculated on the same year's profits as reported on the SA return.

### Rule 6 -- Payment schedule (via Self Assessment)

| Payment | Due Date | What |
|---|---|---|
| First payment on account | 31 January during tax year | 50% of prior year Class 4 liability |
| Second payment on account | 31 July after tax year end | 50% of prior year Class 4 liability |
| Balancing payment | 31 January following tax year end | Remaining Class 4 (and Class 2 if voluntary) |

### Rule 7 -- Employed AND self-employed

Class 1 continues on employment income. Class 4 due on self-employment profits above LPL. Both apply simultaneously. Annual maximum cap checked by HMRC automatically.

### Rule 8 -- Over state pension age

No Class 4 liability. No Class 2 needed. Must still file SA return for income tax. Employees over state pension age also stop paying Class 1 employee (but employer Class 1 continues).

### Rule 9 -- Multiple self-employments

Profits from all self-employments are aggregated for Class 4.

### Rule 10 -- Losses

Zero or negative profits: no Class 4. Voluntary Class 2 may still be paid for state pension.

### Rule 11 -- State pension qualifying years

35 qualifying years for full new state pension (£230.25/week in 2025-26). 10 years minimum. Class 2 is the cheapest way to build years (~£182/year vs Class 3 at £923/year).

### Rule 12 -- NIC is NOT tax-deductible (personal)

Class 2 and Class 4 NIC are NOT deductible business expenses for the individual. They are personal statutory obligations. Employer Class 1 NIC, by contrast, IS a deductible business expense in the company's accounts.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

### T2-1 -- Deferment (multiple employments)

**Trigger:** Client has two employments and expects combined Class 1 to exceed annual maximum.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Client may apply on form CA72A to defer Class 1 in secondary employment.

### T2-2 -- First year with overlap relief / basis period

**Trigger:** Client started trading mid-year; basis period allocation unclear under 2024-25 reform.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer to confirm basis period allocation for Class 4.

### T2-3 -- Backfilling NI gaps for state pension

**Trigger:** Client wants to pay voluntary contributions for prior years.
**Action:** Can go back up to 6 years. Class 2 if eligible as self-employed in those years; otherwise Class 3. Flag for reviewer to check NI record.

### T2-4 -- Examiners, moderators, foster carers

**Trigger:** Employment status is ambiguous.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Check contract terms for employment vs self-employment.

### T2-5 -- Non-resident with UK self-employment

**Trigger:** Client is non-UK resident but has UK self-employment profits.
**Action:** Escalate -- complex NIC rules for non-residents.

### T2-6 -- Employment Allowance eligibility

**Trigger:** Employer payroll client; need to confirm EA can be claimed.
**Action:** Confirm (a) prior-year secondary Class 1 < £100,000, (b) not a single-director-only company (sole director with no other employees), (c) for a connected-company group, only one company claims. Flag for reviewer if any criterion is uncertain.

### T2-7 -- Director on annual earnings basis

**Trigger:** Director's earnings calculated on cumulative annual basis rather than per pay period.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer -- different rules apply for directors' NIC computation.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How NIC payments appear on UK bank statements

**Self Assessment payments (combined tax + NIC):**
- Description: "HMRC SELF ASSESSMENT", "HM REVENUE & CUSTOMS", "HMRC NDDS", "HMRC SHIPLEY"
- Timing: 31 January (1st POA + balancing), 31 July (2nd POA)
- Amount: Combined income tax + Class 4 + optional Class 2 + student loan
- Cannot split NIC from tax on bank statement -- need SA302

**Voluntary Class 2 direct debit:**
- Description: "HMRC NIC", "HMRC CLASS 2", "NIC D/D"
- Timing: Monthly (around 15th) or quarterly
- Amount: Approximately £15/month or £45/quarter (£3.45-3.50/week)

**Employer PAYE/NIC payments:**
- Description: "HMRC PAYE", "HMRC CUMBERNAULD", "PAYE NIC"
- Timing: Monthly (around 22nd) or quarterly for small employers
- Amount: Combined PAYE income tax + Class 1 employee + Class 1 employer + Apprenticeship Levy

**HMRC refunds:**
- Description: "HMRC", "SA REPAYMENT"
- Direction: CREDIT (incoming)
- May include NIC overpayment component

**Key identification tips:**
1. Most self-employed NIC is embedded within SA payments -- you cannot isolate it from the bank statement
2. Only voluntary Class 2 via direct debit appears as a separate NIC-labelled transaction
3. The SA302 tax calculation is the authoritative source for the NIC breakdown
4. Employer NIC is embedded inside the combined monthly PAYE remittance

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement:

1. **Scan for HMRC debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns
2. **Identify SA payment dates** -- 31 Jan and 31 Jul payments are SA payments on account
3. **Identify PAYE payment dates** -- 22nd of each month for employers
4. **Flag combined nature:** "HMRC Self Assessment payments include income tax, Class 4 NIC, optional Class 2, and student loan repayments combined. The bank statement alone cannot isolate the NIC component. Please provide the SA302 tax calculation or the SA100 return for breakdown."
5. **Identify separate Class 2 DD** -- small monthly debits (~£15) labelled "HMRC NIC" are voluntary Class 2

---

### Test suite

**Test 1:** 2025-26, self-employed only, profits £30,000. -> Class 4 = £1,045.80. Class 2 treated as paid. Total = £1,045.80.

**Test 2:** 2025-26, self-employed only, profits £80,000. -> Class 4 = £2,856.60. Total = £2,856.60.

**Test 3:** 2025-26, profits £10,000. -> Class 4 = £0. Profits > SPT, Class 2 treated as paid. Total = £0.

**Test 4:** 2025-26, profits £5,000, voluntary Class 2. -> Class 4 = £0. Class 2 = £182.00. Total = £182.00.

**Test 5:** 2025-26, profits -£3,000, voluntary Class 2. -> Class 4 = £0. Class 2 = £182.00. Total = £182.00.
