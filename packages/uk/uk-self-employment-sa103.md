### MTD ITSA Timeline -- The Biggest 2026-27 Change [T1]

Making Tax Digital for Income Tax Self Assessment (MTD ITSA) phases in mandatory quarterly digital updates for sole traders and landlords. Three thresholds, three start dates -- assessed on gross income (turnover + gross rental income), NOT net profit.

| Phase | Mandation date | Gross income threshold | Test year (look-back) | What changes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | 6 April 2026 | > GBP 50,000 | Assessed on 2024-25 SA103/SA105 | Mandatory quarterly updates + year-end finalisation; MTD-compatible software required |
| Phase 2 | 6 April 2027 | > GBP 30,000 | Assessed on 2025-26 SA103/SA105 | Same rules extend to more traders |
| Phase 3 | 6 April 2028 | > GBP 20,000 | Assessed on 2026-27 SA103/SA105 | Smaller traders brought in |

**Critical points:**
- Threshold is gross income (turnover), NOT profit. A trader with GBP 60,000 turnover and GBP 5,000 profit IS in Phase 1.
- Combined gross income across self-employment AND property is aggregated for the threshold test.
- Phase 1 mandation in April 2026 is based on income reported in the 2024-25 return (filed by 31 Jan 2026). HMRC will notify mandated traders during 2025-26.
- Quarterly updates: 5 Aug, 5 Nov, 5 Feb, 5 May (standard quarters). End-of-period statement + final declaration replaces the SA103 line items but the overall liability process continues.
- Penalty regime: points-based late submission penalties under FA 2021 Sch 24/25 apply once mandated.
- Below threshold or out-of-scope traders continue with annual SA103 as before.

### Key Thresholds -- 3-Year Comparison [T1]

| Item | 2024-25 (Prior) | 2025-26 (Current) | 2026-27 (From April 2026) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SA103S vs SA103F cutoff | Turnover GBP 90,000 | Turnover GBP 90,000 | Turnover GBP 90,000 (MTD finalisation for mandated traders) |
| Trading allowance | GBP 1,000 (frozen) | GBP 1,000 (frozen) | GBP 1,000 (frozen) |
| AIA (Annual Investment Allowance) | GBP 1,000,000 | GBP 1,000,000 | GBP 1,000,000 |
| Cash basis | Default (no upper limit; basis period reform complete) | Default | Default (continues under MTD) |
| Accruals basis | By election | By election | By election |
| Personal allowance | GBP 12,570 (frozen) | GBP 12,570 (frozen) | GBP 12,570 (frozen) |
| Basic rate band | To GBP 50,270 | To GBP 50,270 | To GBP 50,270 |
| Class 4 LPL | GBP 12,570 | GBP 12,570 | GBP 12,570 |
| Class 4 UPL | GBP 50,270 | GBP 50,270 | GBP 50,270 |
| Class 4 main rate | 6% (cut from 9% on 6 Apr 2024) | 6% | 6% |
| Class 4 additional rate | 2% | 2% | 2% |
| Class 2 NIC | Abolished from 6 Apr 2024 (voluntary only when profit < SPT) | Voluntary only | Voluntary only |
| Class 2 voluntary weekly rate | GBP 3.45 | GBP 3.50 (illustrative; HMRC sets annually) | TBC |
| Small Profits Threshold (SPT, for voluntary Class 2 / NI credits) | GBP 6,725 | GBP 6,725 | GBP 6,725 |
| MTD ITSA mandate | Not yet | Notification year (HMRC writes to GBP 50k+ traders) | Phase 1 LIVE for gross income > GBP 50k |

### Class 4 NIC Rates -- Applies All 3 Years [T1]

Post-6-April-2024 rate cut (Finance Act 2024) is now embedded. No further rate changes announced through 2026-27.

| Band | Rate |
|---|---|
| Below GBP 12,570 | 0% |
| GBP 12,570 -- GBP 50,270 | 6% (main rate) |
| Above GBP 50,270 | 2% (additional rate) |

### Class 2 NIC -- Abolished but Optionally Voluntary [T1]

- **Compulsory Class 2 ABOLISHED from 6 April 2024.** Self-employed with profits at or above the Lower Profits Threshold (GBP 12,570) receive Class 2 NI credit treated as paid without payment (since 2022-23). No Class 2 box on the SA103 from 2024-25 onwards for these traders.
- **Voluntary Class 2 still available** when profits are below the Small Profits Threshold (SPT) of GBP 6,725 and the trader wishes to protect State Pension and contributory benefit entitlement. Paid through Self Assessment.
- Applies identically across 2024-25, 2025-26, and 2026-27.

### Simplified Expenses Rates -- Applies All 3 Years [T1]

(Frozen rates; HMRC has not announced changes.)

| Category | Rate |
|---|---|
| Car/van: first 10,000 miles | 45p/mile |
| Car/van: over 10,000 miles | 25p/mile |
| Motorcycle | 24p/mile |
| Home office: 25-50 hrs/month | GBP 10/month |
| Home office: 51-100 hrs/month | GBP 18/month |
| Home office: 101+ hrs/month | GBP 26/month |

### Conservative Defaults [T1]

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown accounting basis | Cash basis (default from 2024-25 onwards) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown whether expense is capital or revenue | Capital (claim via AIA, not revenue expense) |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown entertainment purpose | Not deductible (entertainment is always blocked) |
| Unknown mixed-use proportion | 0% business |
| Unknown MTD ITSA status (2026-27 prep) | Check 2024-25 gross income > GBP 50k -- if yes, assume Phase 1 mandated |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year (6 April to 5 April) in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of whether the trade uses cash basis or accruals.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, mileage log, home office hours log, prior year SA103. For 2026-27: confirmation of MTD ITSA mandation status and software in use.

**Ideal** -- complete bookkeeping records, asset register, prior year losses memo, VAT return (if registered), MTD-compatible software access (Xero, FreeAgent, QuickBooks, etc.) for mandated traders.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-UK-SE-1 -- Partnerships.** "Partnership profits are computed on a separate partnership return (SA800) and allocated to partners via SA104. This skill covers sole traders only."

**R-UK-SE-2 -- LLP members.** "LLP members file SA104 (Partnership). Different rules apply. Out of scope."

**R-UK-SE-3 -- CIS subcontractors (construction).** "CIS has specific deduction and verification rules. While SA103 is used, CIS-specific guidance is out of scope for this skill."

**R-UK-SE-4 -- Non-resident traders.** "Non-resident sole traders have different UK tax obligations. Escalate."

**R-UK-SE-5 -- Overlap relief pre-reform residue.** "Basis period reform completed 5 April 2024. Any residual overlap relief carried into 2024-25 onwards (where not used in 2023-24 transition) is a specialist computation. Escalate."

**R-UK-SE-6 -- MTD ITSA software configuration.** "This skill explains MTD ITSA rules and timing. Selecting, configuring, or operating MTD-compatible software for quarterly submissions is out of scope."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Standard Sole Trader (IT Freelancer), 2025-26

**Year:** 2025-26 (current). Tax-year basis (basis period reform complete).

**Input:** Turnover GBP 52,000. Actual expenses: office rent GBP 6,000, software (incl. Xero) GBP 1,200, accountant GBP 800, phone (50% business) GBP 600, train travel GBP 1,500, laptop GBP 1,300. Cash basis. 8,000 business miles (mileage rate).

**Computation:**
- Turnover: GBP 52,000
- Revenue expenses: 6,000 + 1,200 + 800 + 300 (50% of 600) + 1,500 = GBP 9,800
- Mileage: 8,000 x 45p = GBP 3,600
- Capital allowances (AIA): laptop GBP 1,300
- Total deductions: 9,800 + 3,600 + 1,300 = GBP 14,700
- Taxable profit: 52,000 - 14,700 = GBP 37,300
- Class 4 NIC: (37,300 - 12,570) x 6% = GBP 1,483.80
- Class 2: NONE (abolished; profit > GBP 12,570 gives credit-as-paid)
- **MTD ITSA flag:** 2024-25 turnover was GBP 48,000 (below GBP 50k) -- not in Phase 1 for 2026-27. Re-test annually.

### Example 1B -- Same Trader, 2026-27 (MTD Phase 1 Mandated)

**Year:** 2026-27. Same trader, but 2024-25 turnover was GBP 62,000 (above the GBP 50,000 Phase 1 threshold). HMRC notified trader during 2025-26.

**Mechanics now:**
- Trader uses MTD-compatible software (e.g., FreeAgent) and submits four quarterly updates:
  - Q1: 6 Apr - 5 Jul 2026 → due 5 Aug 2026
  - Q2: 6 Jul - 5 Oct 2026 → due 5 Nov 2026
  - Q3: 6 Oct 2026 - 5 Jan 2027 → due 5 Feb 2027
  - Q4: 6 Jan - 5 Apr 2027 → due 5 May 2027
- End-of-period statement (EOPS) and final declaration replace SA103 line items; tax computation, Class 4, and SA100 finalisation continue on the same timeline (31 Jan 2028 for 2026-27).
- Rates unchanged: 6% / 2% Class 4 bands; trading allowance GBP 1,000.
- Late submission point-based penalties under FA 2021 apply per missed quarterly update.

### Example 2 -- Trading Allowance vs Actual Expenses

(Applies identically in 2024-25, 2025-26, and 2026-27 -- allowance frozen at GBP 1,000.)

**Input:** Side income GBP 4,000 from occasional consulting. Actual expenses GBP 700.

**Computation:**
- Option A (actual): 4,000 - 700 = GBP 3,300 profit
- Option B (trading allowance): 4,000 - 1,000 = GBP 3,000 profit
- Trading allowance is more beneficial. Use GBP 1,000 deduction.
- MTD: gross income GBP 4,000 is below all phase thresholds -- not mandated.

### Example 3 -- Entertainment Blocked

(Unchanged across years.)

**Input:** GBP 500 claimed for client dinner at restaurant.

**Classification:** NOT deductible. Client entertainment is blocked by ITTOIA 2005, s45. Remove from expenses. Staff entertainment (Christmas party, team meals) may be deductible -- but client-facing entertainment never is.

### Example 4 -- Home Office (Simplified vs Actual)

(Unchanged across years.)

**Input:** Works from home 130 hours/month for 11 months. Alternatively, has a dedicated room (1 of 5 rooms). Annual household costs: rent GBP 12,000, utilities GBP 2,400, broadband GBP 480.

**Computation:**
- Simplified: 11 months x GBP 26 = GBP 286
- Actual: 1/5 of (12,000 + 2,400 + 480) = GBP 2,976
- Actual method is significantly more beneficial in this case.
- [T2] Flag: confirm dedicated room used exclusively for business during working hours.

### Example 5 -- Voluntary Class 2 (Low Profits, Pension Credit)

**Year:** 2025-26. Applies identically 2024-25 and 2026-27.

**Input:** Part-time sole trader profit GBP 4,200 (below SPT GBP 6,725). Wants to preserve State Pension qualifying year.

**Computation:**
- Class 4: GBP 0 (profit below GBP 12,570)
- Compulsory Class 2: GBP 0 (abolished 6 Apr 2024)
- Voluntary Class 2: ~52 x GBP 3.50 ≈ GBP 182 (illustrative weekly rate; check HMRC published rate for the year)
- Tick the voluntary Class 2 box on SA103. Paid through Self Assessment.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Trading Income [T1]

**Legislation:** ITTOIA 2005, Part 2

All income from the trade is taxable. Cash basis is the default from 2024-25 (basis period reform completed); accruals available by election. Income recognised when received (cash) or when earned (accruals).

### 5.2 Wholly and Exclusively Test [T1]

**Legislation:** ITTOIA 2005, s34

An expense is deductible only if incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade. Mixed-use expenses: only the business element is deductible.

### 5.3 Capital Allowances [T1]

**Legislation:** CAA 2001

| Allowance | Rate | Eligible Assets |
|---|---|---|
| AIA | 100% (to GBP 1m) | Most plant and machinery (NOT cars) |
| Main rate WDA | 18% reducing balance | Cars 1-50 g/km CO2, assets exceeding AIA |
| Special rate WDA | 6% reducing balance | Cars >50 g/km CO2, integral features, long-life assets |
| Zero-emission car FYA | 100% | New cars with 0 g/km CO2 |

Cars are NEVER eligible for AIA. Always use WDA pools or FYA (if zero-emission). Rates unchanged across 2024-25, 2025-26, 2026-27.

### 5.4 Basis Period Reform -- COMPLETED [T1]

**Legislation:** Finance Act 2022 (introduced); Finance Act 2024 (completion).

- Basis period reform completed on 5 April 2024.
- From 2024-25 onwards, **all sole traders are on the tax-year basis** (6 April to 5 April).
- No more "current year basis" overlap relief computations for new SE work.
- Transition profit (computed in 2023-24) is being spread across 5 years (20% per year, 2023-24 through 2027-28). The 2025-26 return includes the third 20% instalment; the 2026-27 return includes the fourth.
- Any unused overlap relief brought forward into 2023-24 was used or written off in the transition. Residual issues are R-UK-SE-5 (escalate).

### 5.5 Loss Relief [T1]

| Basis | Available Reliefs |
|---|---|
| Cash basis | Carry forward only (no sideways, no carry-back) |
| Accruals | Carry forward, sideways (s64 ITA 2007), carry-back, early years (s72), terminal (s89) |

Sideways relief cap: greater of GBP 50,000 or 25% of adjusted total income. Unchanged across the three years.

### 5.6 Filing and Payment -- 3-Year Schedule [T1]

| Item | 2024-25 (Prior) | 2025-26 (Current) | 2026-27 (From April 2026) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Paper SA filing deadline | 31 October 2025 | 31 October 2026 | 31 October 2027 (or MTD final declaration via software if mandated) |
| Online SA filing deadline | 31 January 2026 | 31 January 2027 | 31 January 2028 |
| Balancing payment | 31 January 2026 | 31 January 2027 | 31 January 2028 |
| POA1 (current year) | 31 January 2026 | 31 January 2027 | 31 January 2028 |
| POA2 (current year) | 31 July 2026 | 31 July 2027 | 31 July 2028 |
| MTD quarterly updates | N/A | N/A (notification year for Phase 1) | Q1: 5 Aug 2026; Q2: 5 Nov 2026; Q3: 5 Feb 2027; Q4: 5 May 2027 |
| MTD EOPS + final declaration | N/A | N/A | 31 January 2028 |

### 5.7 Penalties [T1]

Annual SA penalty regime (unchanged):

| Offence | Penalty |
|---|---|
| 1 day late filing | GBP 100 |
| 3 months late | GBP 10/day for 90 days (max GBP 900) |
| 6 months late | Greater of GBP 300 or 5% of tax due |
| 12 months late | Greater of GBP 300 or 5% of tax due (additional) |
| Late payment (30 days) | 5% of unpaid tax |
| Late payment (6 months) | Additional 5% |
| Late payment (12 months) | Additional 5% |

MTD ITSA points-based penalty regime (from 2026-27 for mandated traders): each missed quarterly update accrues 1 point; threshold (4 points for quarterly filers) triggers GBP 200 penalty per subsequent failure. Late payment under MTD uses the FA 2021 Sch 26 percentage regime.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office [T2]

**Two methods (unchanged across years):**

| Method | Deduction | Requirements |
|---|---|---|
| Simplified flat rate | GBP 10/18/26 per month by hours worked | Record hours monthly |
| Actual costs (proportional) | Room fraction of rent/mortgage interest, utilities, broadband, council tax, insurance | Dedicated workspace used exclusively for business |

Cannot claim both. Once chosen for a year, must use same method all year.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm workspace arrangement and hours/room proportion.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle [T2]

| Method | How It Works | Lock-in |
|---|---|---|
| Mileage rate | 45p first 10k / 25p thereafter. No other car costs claimed. | Once chosen for a vehicle, cannot switch. |
| Actual costs | Fuel, insurance, repairs, road tax x business %. Plus capital allowances on purchase price. | Once chosen for a vehicle, cannot switch. |

Parking and tolls are deductible under EITHER method.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm method choice and business mileage/percentage.

### 6.3 Basis Period Transition Profit Instalment [T2]

For 2025-26: third 20% instalment of any transition profit computed in 2023-24.
For 2026-27: fourth 20% instalment.
For 2027-28 (out of scope here but flag forward): fifth and final instalment.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm transition profit running total and instalment amount, and consider acceleration election where beneficial.

### 6.4 Loss Relief Election [T2]

Choice of loss relief has significant planning implications. Consider: marginal rates, cash vs accruals, first 4 years of trade, cessation.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm which relief(s) to claim.

### 6.5 MTD ITSA Mandation Status [T2 -- New for 2025-26 / 2026-27]

For any client whose 2024-25 gross income (turnover plus gross rental income) approaches or exceeds GBP 50,000:

- Confirm whether HMRC has issued a mandation notice during 2025-26.
- Confirm MTD-compatible software selection and digital records compliance from 6 April 2026.
