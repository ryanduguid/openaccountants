## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

The UK does not have formal statutory safe harbour rules for transfer pricing.

However, several practical reliefs exist:

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| SME exemption | Entities with turnover < £10m, < 50 employees, assets < £5m: exempt from Part 4 adjustment |
| Medium-sized exemption | May apply for medium companies (< 250 employees, turnover < £36m or assets < £18m) unless transaction is with a tax haven |
| Low-value services | HMRC accepts OECD simplified approach (cost-plus 5%) for qualifying services |
| Materiality | HMRC applies practical materiality in audit selection; immaterial transactions unlikely to be challenged |
| UK-to-UK exemption | Domestic related-party transactions exempt from specified TP record requirements |

### 8.1 SME and Medium-Sized Company Exemptions

The SME and medium-sized company exemptions from Part 4 adjustments significantly narrow the scope of UK TP rules in practice. Medium-sized companies are exempt unless the counterparty is in a non-qualifying territory (tax haven).

### 8.2 Diverted Profits Tax Interaction

Companies within the SME/medium exemption may still be exposed to the Diverted Profits Tax (25% rate) if profits are diverted from the UK through arrangements lacking economic substance.
