## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Standard sale with CAC

Taxable base FCFA 1,000,000. TVA = 17.5% x 1,000,000 = FCFA 175,000. CAC = 10% x 175,000 = FCFA 17,500. Total tax = FCFA 192,500 (effective 19.25%).

### Example 2 -- Reverse charge (autoliquidation)

French IT services FCFA 8,000,000. Self-assess TVA FCFA 1,400,000 + CAC FCFA 140,000. Claim input FCFA 1,540,000. Net zero.

## Section 5 -- Classification rules

### 5.1 Standard rate 19.25% (17.5% TVA + 10% CAC surcharge)

- **Standard rate CAC computation** — CAC is 10% of TVA amount, NOT of taxable base. Both always blocked or allowed together.

### 5.2 Reduced rate 11% (social housing, 2026 Finance Law: 10% TVA + 1% CAC)

### 5.3 Zero-rated

Exports, international transport, diplomatic supplies.

### 5.4 Exempt

### Input: B1-B8

- **Input B1-B8 definitions** — B1 (local TVA), B2 (local CAC), B3 (import TVA), B4 (import CAC), B5 (capital goods TVA+CAC), B6 (autoliquidation input), B7 (exclusions), B8 (total deductible).

### Net: C1-C3

- **Net C1-C3 formula** — C1 = A10-B8. C2 = credit reporte. C3 = payable or carry forward.

## Section 7 -- Reverse charge (autoliquidation)

- **Reverse charge rule** — Services from non-resident: self-assess TVA 17.5% + CAC 10% of TVA. Both must be self-assessed. Claim input if taxable. Net zero.  _(CGI, Art. 135)_

## Section 8 -- Deductibility and blocked input

Blocked (CGI Art. 144-147): vehicles < 9 seats (unless taxi), staff accommodation, entertainment/gifts, fuel for blocked vehicles, personal use, invoices without NIU.

### Test suite

**Test 1 -- Standard sale.** FCFA 10M. Expected: TVA FCFA 1.75M, CAC FCFA 175K, total FCFA 1.925M.

**Test 2 -- Local purchase.** FCFA 5M + TVA 875K + CAC 87.5K. Expected: both recoverable.

### Escalation protocol

```
REVIEWER FLAG / ESCALATION REQUIRED
[Standard format]
```

### Out of scope -- direct tax

- Corporate IS: 33% (including 10% surcharge)
- PAYE (IRPP): progressive 10%-35%
- CNPS: family 7%, work injury 1.75%-5%

### Prohibitions

- NEVER separate TVA recovery from CAC -- always together
- NEVER confuse zero-rated with exempt
- NEVER treat CEMAC as intra-community
- NEVER accept invoices without NIU
- NEVER compute numbers -- engine handles arithmetic
- NEVER file without checking credit reporte
