## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### KSeF API 2.0

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| API specification | OpenAPI 3.0.4 (JSON) |
| Production endpoint | `https://api.ksef.mf.gov.pl/v2` |
| DEMO endpoint | `https://api-demo.ksef.mf.gov.pl/v2` |
| Test endpoint | `https://api-test.ksef.mf.gov.pl/v2` |
| Authentication | Qualified electronic signature, trusted profile (profil zaufany), or KSeF authorisation token |
| Session types | Interactive (real-time, single invoices) or Batch (bulk submission) |

### Submission Flow

1. **Authenticate** -- open a KSeF session using certificate, trusted profile, or token
2. **Submit** -- send FA(3) XML file via API endpoint
3. **Validate** -- KSeF performs XSD and semantic validation
4. **Accept or Reject** -- if valid, KSeF assigns a unique KSeF number and timestamp; if invalid, returns error
5. **UPO** -- download Urzędowe Poświadczenie Odbioru (official receipt of acceptance) as proof of issuance
6. **Buyer access** -- buyer retrieves invoice from KSeF using their NIP credentials

### Alternative Submission Methods

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| Aplikacja Podatnika KSeF | Free web application from Ministry of Finance |
| Aplikacja Mobilna KSeF | Free mobile app for issuing/receiving on smartphone |
| e-mikrofirma | Integration with e-Urząd Skarbowy for micro-businesses |
| Batch mode | Upload ZIP of multiple FA(3) XMLs; each validated individually |

### Offline Mode

If KSeF is unavailable (system downtime declared by MF), businesses may:

1. Issue invoices outside KSeF with offline numbering
2. Submit to KSeF within 7 days of system restoration
3. The date of issue (P_1) remains the original date; the KSeF date is the submission date
4. Offline invoices require specific handling and must reference the offline period

### KSeF Number Format

Format: `{NIP}-{YYYYMMDD}-{sequential number}` -- assigned by KSeF upon acceptance. This number becomes the primary legal identifier of the invoice.

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### XSD Validation (First Layer)

KSeF validates every submitted XML against the FA(3) XSD. Approximately 70% of rejections are XSD validation errors.

| Common XSD Error | Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Missing required element | Required field not populated (e.g., NIP in Podmiot1) | Populate all mandatory fields |
| Wrong date format | Dates must be YYYY-MM-DD (not DD.MM.YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY) | Standardise date formatting |
| Invalid element order | XML elements must follow XSD-defined sequence | Reorder elements per schema |
| Wrong data type | Numeric field contains text or vice versa | Validate field types |
| Excess decimal places | Amounts: max 2 decimals; prices: max 8; quantities: max 6 | Apply correct precision |

### Semantic Validation (Second Layer)

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| NIP checksum | Seller NIP must pass modulus-11 check digit validation |
| Tax calculation | Sum of line net amounts per rate must equal summary amount (P_13_x); VAT amounts must equal P_14_x |
| Gross total | P_15 must equal sum of all net amounts + all VAT amounts |
| GTU format | Must be exact codes (e.g., `GTU_12` not `12` or `GTU 12`) |
| Duplicate detection | Same seller NIP + invoice number + date = error 440 (duplicate) |
| Adnotacje completeness | All mandatory annotation fields (P_16, P_17, P_18, P_18A) must be populated |
| Zwolnienie logic | If any line has rate "zw", the Zwolnienie element must specify the exemption basis |
| Currency handling | Foreign currency invoices must include PLN conversion amounts in separate fields |

### Common Rejection Scenarios

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Polish NIP in NrVatUE field | Polish NIPs go in the NIP field; NrVatUE is for EU VAT numbers with country prefix |
| Rounding mismatch | Use banker's rounding; ensure line totals sum to header totals within 1 grosz |
| Negative quantities on non-corrective invoice | Only corrective invoices (korekta) may have negative values |
| Missing Adnotacje fields | Even if not applicable, P_16 through P_18A must contain value "2" (not applicable) |
| Invalid bank account format | Polish IBAN must be exactly 26 characters (digits only, no PL prefix in domestic format) |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates (2025/2026)

| Rate Code | Rate | Application |
|---|---|---|
| 23 | 23% | Standard rate |
| 8 | 8% | Reduced (construction, certain food, medical) |
| 5 | 5% | Reduced (basic food, books, periodicals) |
| 0 | 0% | Zero-rated (intra-EU supplies, exports) |
| zw | Exempt | VAT-exempt supplies (must specify exemption basis) |
| oo | Not subject | Out-of-scope transactions |
| np | Not applicable | Supplies not subject to Polish VAT (e.g., place of supply outside Poland) |

### Rounding

- Line net amount (`P_11`): 2 decimal places
- Unit price (`P_10`): up to 8 decimal places
- Quantity (`P_9A`/`P_9B`): up to 6 decimal places
- VAT amount per line (`P_11A`): 2 decimal places
- Gross total (`P_15`): 2 decimal places
- Use banker's rounding (round half to even) for consistency with KSeF validation
- Sum of line amounts must exactly equal the corresponding summary field -- no tolerance

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

- Each applicable VAT rate has dedicated summary fields (P_13_1/P_14_1 for 23%, P_13_2/P_14_2 for 8%, etc.)
- Line items reference the rate via P_12
- If a single invoice has lines at 23%, 8%, and exempt, all three summary pairs must be populated
- P_15 (gross total) = sum of all P_13_x + sum of all P_14_x

### Split Payment (Mechanizm Podzielonej Płatności -- MPP)

- Mandatory for transactions > PLN 15,000 gross involving goods/services listed in Annex 15 to the VAT Act
- Set annotation P_18A = 1 when MPP applies
- Invoice must include the phrase "mechanizm podzielonej płatności"
- Payment is split: net amount to seller's account, VAT amount to seller's VAT account

### Corrective Invoices (Faktury Korygujące)

- Must reference the original KSeF number of the corrected invoice
- Show both "before" and "after" values, or the difference
- Use same FA(3) schema with corrective-specific fields populated
- KSeF validates that the referenced original invoice exists and belongs to the same seller NIP

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| KSeF as legal archive | KSeF stores all accepted invoices for 10 years -- this constitutes the legal archive |
| No separate archiving needed | Once accepted by KSeF, the invoice is legally archived; businesses do not need to maintain separate copies for VAT purposes |
| Attachments | KSeF does NOT store attachments (Zalacznik node in FA(3) is metadata only); supporting documents (contracts, delivery notes) must be archived separately by the business |
| UPO retention | Retain UPO (official receipt) as proof of successful submission |
| Pre-KSeF invoices | Invoices issued before KSeF mandate remain subject to standard Polish archiving rules (5 years from end of tax year) |
| Access | Both seller and buyer can retrieve invoices from KSeF at any time during the retention period using their NIP credentials |
| Audit | Tax authorities have direct access to all KSeF invoices; no separate data provision needed during audits |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

Financial penalties take effect from 1 January 2027. During 2026, the practical consequences of non-compliance are primarily operational (invoices not legally valid for VAT deduction).

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Issuing invoice outside KSeF (when mandatory) | Up to 100% of the VAT amount on the invoice |
| Invoice not conforming to FA(3) schema | Rejection by KSeF -- invoice not legally issued; must correct and resubmit |
| Failure to issue invoice at all | Standard VAT Act penalties apply (up to 720 daily rates under fiscal penal code) |
| Late submission in offline mode | Must submit within 7 days of system restoration; late submission may trigger penalties |
| Buyer deducting input VAT from non-KSeF invoice | Input VAT deduction denied -- buyer bears the risk |
| Using non-KSeF invoices after mandate date | Trading partners on compliant systems may reject non-KSeF invoices |

### Practical Risks During 2026 (Before Penalty Enforcement)

- Invoices not submitted through KSeF are not legally valid for VAT deduction purposes
- Trading partners may refuse non-KSeF invoices
- Audit exposure increases as KAS cross-references KSeF data

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT Return Integration

- KSeF data directly feeds into JPK_VAT (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny) -- the standard audit file for VAT
- JPK_V7M (monthly) and JPK_V7K (quarterly) declarations must reconcile with invoices in KSeF
- KSeF invoice numbers are used as references in JPK records
- GTU codes from KSeF invoices must match GTU markings in JPK_VAT
- Split payment (MPP) markers from KSeF feed into JPK_VAT classification
- Tax authorities can automatically cross-check KSeF invoices against JPK declarations in real-time

### e-Urząd Skarbowy Integration

- The e-mikrofirma module in e-Urząd Skarbowy connects directly to KSeF
- Taxpayers can issue invoices in KSeF and transfer data directly to VAT records without manual re-entry
- Pre-filled VAT returns based on KSeF data are progressively being developed

### Income Tax Integration

- For sole proprietors (JDG -- jednoosobowa działalność gospodarcza), KSeF invoice data feeds into the annual PIT-36/PIT-36L return
- Revenue and cost figures must reconcile with KSeF records
- KSeF provides an authoritative source for income verification during audits

### Cross-Border Considerations

- All invoices issued by Polish VAT payers, including intra-EU and export invoices, must be reported through KSeF
- Intra-EU supplies must be reported in both KSeF and the EU VAT Information Exchange System (VIES) via VAT-UE declaration
- Import VAT (from customs declarations) is handled separately but must reconcile with purchase invoices in KSeF

### PEF (Platforma Elektronicznego Fakturowania) Integration

- B2G invoices previously submitted through PEF are being migrated to KSeF
- From 1 February 2026, PEF forwards invoices to KSeF production environment
- Public entities receive invoices through KSeF with PEF acting as an intermediary during transition
