| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Do you have a Wisconsin sales tax registration / tax ID? | Determines whether registration is needed before filing. |
| 2 | What is your current filing frequency (monthly / quarterly / annually)? | Controls which return periods to prepare. |
| 3 | What is your nexus type -- physical presence, economic nexus, or both? | Determines registration obligations and applicable rules. |
| 4 | Are you a marketplace seller (selling through Amazon, Etsy, etc.)? | Marketplace facilitator may already be collecting on your behalf. |
| 5 | What types of products or services do you sell in Wisconsin? | Drives taxability classification under Wisconsin law. |
| 6 | Do you sell to exempt entities (government, nonprofits, resellers)? | Determines whether exemption certificates must be collected and retained. |
| 7 | Do you have locations, employees, or inventory in Wisconsin? | Physical presence creates nexus independent of economic thresholds. |
| 8 | Do you sell into multiple Wisconsin local jurisdictions? | Local tax rates vary; determines compliance complexity. |
