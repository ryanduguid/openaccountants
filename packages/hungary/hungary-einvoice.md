---

## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Who Must Comply

**All Hungarian VAT-registered taxpayers** who issue invoices must report invoice data in real-time to the NAV Online Számla system. This includes:

- Domestic B2B invoices (all VAT amounts, including zero)
- Domestic B2C invoices
- Invoices issued to other EU member states (intra-community supplies)
- Export invoices to third countries
- Self-billing invoices (buyer issues on behalf of supplier)
- Modification invoices (credit notes, corrections)

The only invoices excluded from RTIR are those issued under the OSS (One-Stop Shop) regime for non-established sellers.

### Timeline Phases

| Date | Milestone |
|---|---|
| 1 July 2018 | RTIR launched for B2B invoices with VAT ≥ HUF 100,000 |
| 1 July 2020 | RTIR extended to all B2B invoices regardless of VAT amount (XSD 2.0 mandatory) |
| 4 January 2021 | B2C invoices included in RTIR; all invoices now reportable |
| 1 June 2021 | XSD 3.0 mandatory for all submissions; optional e-invoice feature activated |
| 1 April 2021 | XSD 2.0 and earlier rejected; 3.0 exclusively accepted |
| 15 May 2025 | NAV officially ends all support for XSD 2.0 |
| 2026--2028 | ViDA alignment: transition from RTIR (data reporting) to full structured e-invoicing (EN 16931 XML as the legally binding invoice) |

### RTIR vs E-Invoicing Distinction

Hungary operates a **real-time invoice data reporting** model, not a clearance model. The reported XML is a copy of the invoice data, not the invoice itself (unless `completenessIndicator=true`). The legal invoice can be paper, PDF, or (optionally) the XML itself.

With XSD 3.0, businesses can opt to declare the XML as the actual electronic invoice by setting `completenessIndicator=true`. In this case, the XML becomes the legally binding document and is available to the buyer via NAV's system.

---

## Section 3 -- Technical Format

### XML Schema (XSD 3.0)

The NAV Online Számla system uses a proprietary XML schema maintained by NAV. As of 2026, only **XSD version 3.0** is accepted.

| Schema | Namespace | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `invoiceData.xsd` | `http://schemas.nav.gov.hu/OSA/3.0/data` | Invoice data content |
| `invoiceApi.xsd` | `http://schemas.nav.gov.hu/OSA/3.0/api` | API request/response envelopes |
| `base.xsd` | `http://schemas.nav.gov.hu/OSA/3.0/base` | Common base types |
| `common.xsd` | `http://schemas.nav.gov.hu/NTCA/1.0/common` | NTCA common types |

### Key Schema Structures

| Structure | Description |
|---|---|
| `InvoiceData` | Root element for invoice data XML |
| `InvoiceMain` | Contains `Invoice` (for normal invoices) or `BatchInvoice` (for summary invoices) |
| `InvoiceHead` | Supplier data, customer data, fiscal representative |
| `InvoiceDetail` | Invoice-level detail: category, appearance, currency, exchange rate, payment method, dates |
| `InvoiceLines` | Line-level data: descriptions, quantities, amounts, VAT rates, product codes |
| `InvoiceSummary` | Summary totals per VAT rate, global totals |

### API Request Types

| Request | XML Root | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ManageInvoiceRequest` | `invoiceApi:ManageInvoiceRequest` | Submit new invoices or modifications |
| `TokenExchangeRequest` | `invoiceApi:TokenExchangeRequest` | Obtain session token |
| `QueryInvoiceDataRequest` | `invoiceApi:QueryInvoiceDataRequest` | Query submitted invoice data |
| `QueryTransactionStatusRequest` | `invoiceApi:QueryTransactionStatusRequest` | Check processing status |
| `ManageAnnulmentRequest` | `invoiceApi:ManageAnnulmentRequest` | Technical annulment of erroneous data |

When `completenessIndicator=true`, NAV makes the invoice XML available to the buyer for download, and the XML serves as the legally binding invoice.

---

## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### NAV Online Számla API

| Component | Detail |
|---|---|
| API type | RESTful XML-based API |
| Production URL | `https://api.onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/invoiceService/v3/` |
| Test URL | `https://api-test.onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu/invoiceService/v3/` |
| Web portal | `https://onlineszamla.nav.gov.hu` (manual queries and management) |
| Authentication | Technical user credentials (login + password) + XML signing key + XML exchange key |
| Submission deadline | Immediately upon invoice issuance; technically within 5 minutes |

### API Workflow

1. **Token Exchange**: Call `TokenExchangeRequest` to obtain a session token (valid for 5 minutes)
2. **Prepare Invoice XML**: Generate `invoiceData` XML conforming to XSD 3.0
3. **Compress and encode**: Base64-encode the invoice data; optionally compress
4. **Submit**: Call `ManageInvoiceRequest` with the encoded invoice data, operation type (CREATE, MODIFY, STORNO), and request signature
5. **Receive transaction ID**: NAV returns a `transactionId`
6. **Query status**: Call `QueryTransactionStatusRequest` to verify processing result (RECEIVED, PROCESSING, DONE, ABORTED)

### Request Signature

Every `ManageInvoiceRequest` must include a request signature computed from:
- Request ID
- Timestamp
- XML signing key
- Invoice hash values

The signature algorithm uses SHA-512 and the technical user's signing key.

### Batch Submission

Up to 100 invoice operations can be submitted in a single `ManageInvoiceRequest` (within the `invoiceOperations` element). Each operation has its own index, operation type, and invoice data.

### Technical User Management

Each taxpayer registers an "elsődleges felhasználó" (primary user) on the NAV portal, who then creates technical users for API access. Each technical user has:
- Login name and password
- XML signing key (cserekulcs)
- XML exchange key (aláírókulcs)

If keys are regenerated on the portal, they must be updated in the invoicing software immediately.

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### NAV-Side Validation

NAV validates every submitted invoice against:

1. **XSD schema validation** -- must conform to XSD 3.0; earlier versions rejected
2. **Request signature validation** -- cryptographic signature must be valid
3. **Technical user validation** -- credentials and keys must match
4. **Business rule validation**:
   - Tax number format and validity (8-digit taxpayer ID + VAT code + county code)
   - Invoice number uniqueness per supplier
   - Modification references: original invoice must exist in the system (unless `modifyWithoutMaster=true`)
   - `completenessIndicator` restrictions (cannot be true for paper invoices, private person invoices, merged invoices, or pre-2021 invoices)
   - Currency and exchange rate consistency
   - VAT rate validity against current Hungarian VAT law

### Pre-Submission Checks

- Validate XML against XSD 3.0 locally before API call
- Verify request signature computation is correct
- Confirm technical user credentials and keys are current (keys must be refreshed if regenerated on the portal)
- Verify tax number validity using NAV's public tax number query service
- Ensure invoice number has not been previously submitted
- For modifications: verify original invoice exists and modification index is sequential

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Reason | Detail |
|---|---|
| XSD version mismatch | Submission uses XSD 1.x or 2.0 (rejected since April 2021) |
| Invalid request signature | Signing key mismatch or computation error |
| Invalid tax number | Supplier or customer tax number format invalid or not registered |
| Duplicate invoice number | Same invoice number already submitted by the same supplier |
| Modification reference error | Referenced original invoice not found and `modifyWithoutMaster=false` |
| CompletionIndicator conflict | `completenessIndicator=true` with non-electronic appearance or private person |
| Missing mandatory field | Required XSD element absent or empty |
| Rate validation failure | VAT percentage does not match known Hungarian rates |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### Hungarian VAT Rates (2026)

| Rate | Percentage | Application |
|---|---|---|
| Standard | 27% | Most goods and services (one of the highest in the EU) |
| Reduced 1 | 18% | Dairy products, bakery products, commercial accommodation |
| Reduced 2 | 5% | Basic foodstuffs (meat, eggs, milk), books, newspapers, medicines, district heating, internet access, new residential property (conditions apply), live performances |
| Exempt | 0% | Intra-community supplies, exports, certain financial and insurance services |

### Rounding Rules

- VAT amounts calculated per line in the invoice currency (HUF or foreign currency).
- HUF amounts rounded to the nearest whole forint (no decimals).
- EUR/foreign currency amounts rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Summary totals are the sum of rounded line-level amounts.
- NAV validates that line-level amounts sum to the summary totals (with tolerance).

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

Each VAT rate has a separate `summaryByVatRate` element in the `invoiceSummary`. Each element contains:
- `vatRateNetData` (taxable base at this rate)
- `vatRateVatData` (VAT amount at this rate)
- `vatRateGrossData` (gross amount at this rate)

Lines with different VAT rates must declare the rate individually.

### Currency Handling

For invoices in foreign currency:
- `currencyCode` must be a valid ISO 4217 code
- `exchangeRate` is the MNB (Magyar Nemzeti Bank) rate on the tax point date or a contractual rate
- HUF equivalents are required in the summary for tax reporting purposes
- If the invoice is in HUF, `exchangeRate` must be 1

### Reverse Charge

Domestic reverse charge (fordított adózás) invoices must be reported with:
- `vatExemption` or `vatOutOfScope` indicator on relevant lines
- Specific VAT rate type `VAT_RATE_EXEMPT` with the appropriate exemption reason

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 8 years from the end of the year in which the invoice was issued (Számviteli törvény) |
| Format (paper invoice) | Paper original must be retained; RTIR XML is a data report, not the legal document |
| Format (PDF invoice) | Digitally signed PDF with timestamp is the legal document; must be archived with signature intact |
| Format (XML e-invoice, completenessIndicator=true) | The XML submitted to NAV is the legal document; buyer downloads from NAV; both parties must retain the XML |
| Integrity | No modification permitted to the archived document; audit trail required |
| Accessibility | Must be available for NAV audit within the territory of Hungary (or EU with immediate electronic access) |
| NAV portal | NAV retains all submitted RTIR data; businesses can query via the web portal or API; however, NAV data is a report, not an archive -- businesses must maintain their own records |
| Buyer obligation (XML e-invoice) | If `completenessIndicator=true`, the buyer retrieves the XML from NAV and archives it as the original invoice |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

### RTIR-Specific Penalties

| Violation | Penalty (HUF) |
|---|---|
| Failure to report invoice data to NAV | Up to HUF 500,000 per invoice (approx. EUR 1,300) |
| Late reporting (beyond the real-time deadline) | Graduated fines based on delay duration |
| Incorrect data in RTIR submission | Up to HUF 500,000 per invoice |
| Use of non-compliant invoicing software | Fines per NAV decree; software must be registered with NAV |
| Systematic non-compliance | Triggers risk classification; increased audit probability |

### General VAT Penalties

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to issue invoice | Up to HUF 500,000 per instance |
| Incorrect invoice content | Tax reassessment + penalty (50% of tax shortfall as default penalty; 200% if fraud) |
| Late VAT return filing | Late payment interest + administrative fine |
| VAT fraud | Criminal penalties under Hungarian Penal Code |

### Practical Consequences

- NAV uses RTIR data for automated risk analysis; persistent errors trigger compliance audits
- The planned e-ÁFA (pre-filled VAT return) system relies on correct RTIR data; incorrect submissions lead to discrepancies in the pre-filled return
- Buyers increasingly verify supplier RTIR compliance before accepting invoices

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### RTIR → VAT Return (ÁFA bevallás)

NAV uses RTIR data to construct the e-ÁFA (electronic VAT) pre-filled return. From 2024, NAV offers taxpayers a draft VAT return based on:
- Supplier-reported outbound invoices
- Buyer-received inbound invoices
- Customs declarations

Taxpayers review, adjust, and submit the pre-filled return. Discrepancies between RTIR data and the filed return trigger automated queries.

### RTIR → e-ÁFA Pre-Filled Return

The e-ÁFA system pre-populates:
- Output VAT from the taxpayer's submitted invoices
- Input VAT from suppliers' reported invoices where the taxpayer is the buyer
- Adjustments for credit notes and modifications

This significantly reduces manual data entry for small and medium businesses.

### Electronic Invoice (completenessIndicator=true) → Buyer AP

When a supplier sets `completenessIndicator=true`, the buyer can retrieve the structured XML invoice from NAV's system. This enables automated accounts payable processing, booking, and reconciliation.

### RTIR → Corporate Tax (Társasági adó)

NAV cross-references RTIR data against corporate tax returns. Revenue and cost data from invoices feeds into NAV's risk-analysis algorithms for corporate tax audits.

### Future: ViDA Alignment

Hungary's RTIR is expected to evolve into a full structured e-invoicing system aligned with EU ViDA requirements by 2028--2030. The transition will shift from data reporting (XML as a copy) to clearance or exchange (XML as the legally binding invoice, EN 16931 format). Hungary's advanced RTIR infrastructure positions it well for this transition.

### NAV Online Számla → e-Nyugta (Electronic Receipt)

NAV is developing the e-nyugta system for electronic receipts, which will eventually replace traditional cash registers for retail B2C transactions. This system will integrate with the existing Online Számla infrastructure.
