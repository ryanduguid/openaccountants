### Administrative history

| Period | Administrator |
|---|---|
| Pre-2015 | City of Detroit — Income Tax Division (Coleman A. Young Municipal Center) |
| 2015 onward | Michigan Department of Treasury, City Tax Administration — under inter-governmental agreement with the City of Detroit per 2014 PA 198–202; state collects, all revenue net of administration retained by the city |

The 2014/2015 transition replaced the legacy Form D-1040(R) / D-1040(NR) /
D-1040(L) with the current 5118 / 5119 / 5120 series. Some practitioner and
software documentation still references "D-1040" — it is the predecessor of
Form 5118.

## Section 2: Quick reference — rates, exemption, thresholds

### Tax rates (TY 2025)

| Taxpayer status | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Detroit resident | 2.4% on all income, wherever earned | MCL 141.611; Detroit Ordinance |
| Non-resident | 1.2% on Detroit-source income only | MCL 141.611; MCL 141.613 |
| Part-year resident | 2.4% on income earned while resident + 1.2% on Detroit-source income earned while non-resident | Form 5120 instructions |

Detroit is the only Michigan city with a 2.4%/1.2% rate. The Uniform City
Income Tax Act caps non-Detroit cities at 1.0% resident / 0.5% non-resident;
Detroit has special statutory authority for the higher rate under
MCL 141.503(3).

### Personal exemption (TY 2025)

| Item | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal / dependent exemption | $600 each | Form 5118 (2025) line instructions |

Detroit's exemption is **not** indexed and has remained at $600 for many
years. It is distinct from the Michigan state personal exemption ($5,800 in
2026) — they are not coordinated.

### Filing deadline and extensions

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Annual return due | April 15, 2026 (for TY 2025) |
| Extension request | Form 5209 (City Application for Extension) — must be filed by April 15 with payment of estimated balance due |
| Automatic federal extension | Does **not** automatically extend the Detroit return — separate Form 5209 required |
| Electronic filing | Available via Michigan Treasury Online (MTO) and most major tax software |

### Estimated tax

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Threshold to require estimated payments | Expected city tax liability after withholding ≥ **$100** |
| Estimated voucher | Form 5123 — City Estimated Individual Income Tax Voucher |
| Quarterly due dates | April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 |
| Underpayment penalty form | Form 5338 (sometimes referenced as Form 5125 in older releases — `[VERIFY:]` confirm with Treasury 2025 instructions) |

### Penalty and interest

| Item | Rate / Amount |
|---|---|
| Late filing penalty | 5% of unpaid tax for first 2 months; +5% per month thereafter, max 25% |
| Late payment penalty | 1% per month, max 25% |
| Interest | Daily rate set by Treasury (federal short-term rate +1%, recomputed semi-annually) |

## Section 3: Detroit residency determination

Detroit residency is determined **independently** from Michigan state
residency. A taxpayer can be a Michigan domiciliary for state purposes but
non-resident of Detroit for city purposes (very common — anyone domiciled
in the Detroit metro area outside the city limits). The reverse is rare but
possible (Detroit resident temporarily absent from Michigan).

### Domicile test for Detroit (MCL 141.604)

A taxpayer is a Detroit resident for the tax year if their **domicile** —
their fixed, permanent, principal home — is within the boundaries of the
City of Detroit during the year. Factors considered:

| Factor | Indicia of Detroit domicile |
|---|---|
| Voter registration address | Detroit precinct |
| Driver license address | Detroit street address |
| Family home location | House/apartment within Detroit city limits |
| Mail delivery | Detroit address as principal mailing address |
| Bank account address | Detroit address |
| Length of physical presence | Greater part of the year within Detroit |
| Children's school enrollment | Detroit Public Schools Community District |

A "Detroit ZIP code" is not dispositive — many suburbs (Highland Park,
Hamtramck, Grosse Pointe, Dearborn, Ferndale) share parts of 482xx ZIP
codes but are independent municipalities. **Always verify the street
address against the City of Detroit boundary using the City Assessor's
property search before declaring residency.** Highland Park and Hamtramck
are physically enclosed by Detroit but are separate cities with their own
income taxes (Highland Park 2.0%/1.0%; Hamtramck 1.0%/0.5%).

### Part-year residency

If the taxpayer moved into or out of Detroit during the year, Form 5120 is
required. The taxpayer apportions income between the resident period
(taxed at 2.4%) and the non-resident period (Detroit-source only, taxed
at 1.2%).

---

## Section 4: The three filing patterns

### Pattern A — Full-year Detroit resident (Form 5118)

- Taxes all income wherever earned at 2.4%.
- Reports federal AGI starting point (Form 1040, Line 11).
- Applies Detroit additions / subtractions on the front of Form 5118.
- Claims personal exemptions ($600 × dependents).
- Receives credit for tax paid to **another** Michigan city on
  non-Detroit-source wages (e.g., resident who works in Grand Rapids) —
  Form 5118 credit line — limited to lower of the other city's tax or
  Detroit's tax on the same income.
- Files Form 5121 if there was any city withholding from W-2s.

### Pattern B — Non-resident with Detroit-source income (Form 5119)

- Taxes only Detroit-source income at 1.2%.
- Detroit-source income for non-residents (MCL 141.613) is limited to:
  1. **Compensation** for work physically performed in Detroit (apportioned
     by days worked in Detroit / total work days);
  2. **Net profit** from a business / profession carried on in Detroit, to
     the extent of the in-city business allocation percentage (Form 5327);
  3. **Capital gains** and **rental income** from real or tangible personal
     property located in Detroit;
  4. **Distributive share** of partnership / S-corp net profit attributable
     to Detroit business activity (see Section 7).
- A non-resident generally does **not** owe Detroit tax on interest,
  dividends, pension, IRA distributions, Social Security, unemployment, or
  capital gains on intangibles — these are taxed only to Detroit residents.

### Pattern C — Part-year resident (Form 5120)

- The year is split at the date of move. The taxpayer files a single
  Form 5120 combining:
  - The resident period: tax all income earned during that period at 2.4%;
  - The non-resident period: tax only Detroit-source income earned during
    that period at 1.2%.
- Income is allocated by actual date received (cash basis) or by
  reasonable proration where the income is not date-identifiable (e.g.,
  bonus tied to full year — typically prorated by days).

## Section 5: Income inclusions and exclusions

### Detroit treatment of common income items

| Income type | Detroit resident (2.4%) | Detroit non-resident (1.2%) | Statutory basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| W-2 wages, salary, bonus, commission | **Taxable** on all wages | **Taxable** only on wages for work physically done in Detroit (apportion) | MCL 141.612 / 141.613 |
| Self-employment net profit (Schedule C) | **Taxable** on full net profit | **Taxable** on Detroit-apportioned share (Form 5327) | MCL 141.613(b) |
| Partnership K-1 (ordinary business income) | **Taxable** on full distributive share | **Taxable** on distributive share apportioned to Detroit business activity | MCL 141.613(c) |
| S-corp K-1 (ordinary business income) | **Taxable** if elected to pass through; see Section 9 (S-corp treatment note) | Generally **not taxable** to non-resident shareholder for city income tax purposes — Detroit treats S-corps differently from federal | `[VERIFY:]` Detroit Ordinance §6; Form 5119 instructions |
| Interest (bank, brokerage) | **Taxable** | **Not taxable** | MCL 141.612 |
| Dividends | **Taxable** | **Not taxable** | MCL 141.612 |
| Capital gain — intangibles (stocks, mutual funds) | **Taxable** | **Not taxable** | MCL 141.613 |
| Capital gain — real property in Detroit | **Taxable** | **Taxable** (Detroit-source) | MCL 141.613(d) |
| Rental income — Detroit property | **Taxable** | **Taxable** | MCL 141.613(d) |
| Rental income — non-Detroit property | **Taxable** | **Not taxable** | MCL 141.613 |
| Pension / annuity (private, state, federal) | **NOT TAXABLE** — Detroit excludes retirement income | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance — retirement exclusion |
| IRA distributions (incl. Roth conversions) | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance — retirement exclusion |
| 401(k) / 403(b) distributions | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance — retirement exclusion |
| Social Security benefits | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance |
| Unemployment compensation | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance; Form 5118 instructions |
| Military pay (active duty) | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance — military exclusion |
| Worker's comp / disability | **NOT TAXABLE** | **Not taxable** | Detroit Ordinance |
| State / federal income tax refunds | **NOT TAXABLE** (Detroit does not pick up federal AGI inclusion of state refunds) | **Not taxable** | Form 5118 subtraction line |
| Gambling winnings | **Taxable** on full amount | **Taxable** if won at a Detroit-licensed casino (MotorCity, MGM Grand, Hollywood/Greektown) | MCL 141.613(g) [VERIFY] |
| Alimony received (pre-2019 decrees) | **Taxable** | **Not taxable** | Conforms to federal AGI definition |

**Key takeaway:** Detroit is more generous than the Michigan state return
for **retired** taxpayers — pensions, IRAs, Social Security, and 401(k)
distributions are entirely outside the Detroit base. This means a retired
Detroit resident with only investment income and pensions typically owes
**zero** Detroit tax even though they may owe Michigan state tax.

### Adjustments / deductions allowed (Form 5118, page 2)

| Deduction | Allowed? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IRA contribution (above-the-line) | **Yes**, to extent allowed federally | Mirrors federal Form 1040 Schedule 1 deduction |
| Self-employment tax deduction (½ SE tax) | **Yes** | Mirrors federal §164(f) |
| Self-employed health insurance | **Yes** | Mirrors federal §162(l) |
| Self-employed retirement (SEP, Solo 401(k)) | **Yes** | Mirrors federal §404 deduction |
| Alimony paid (pre-2019 decrees) | **Yes** | |
| Moving expenses | **Yes**, if moving **into** Detroit for a new principal job location; tied to historical federal §217 rules | Form 5118 specific deduction line |
| Renaissance Zone deduction | **Yes**, if the taxpayer's residence or business is within a designated Detroit Renaissance Zone | MCL 125.2681 et seq.; Form 5118 specific line |

---

## Section 6: Apportionment rules for non-residents

### Wage / salary apportionment — the "days worked in Detroit" formula

Detroit uses a strict **days-worked-in-Detroit / total-work-days** ratio
for non-resident wages. The formula appears on Form 5121 Part 3:

```
Detroit-source wages = Total wages × (Days actually worked in Detroit
                                      ÷ Total days actually worked)
```

Total work days = total compensated days minus vacation, holiday, sick,
and paid leave days. The standard year is approximately 240–260 work days
depending on the employer's calendar.

### Post-COVID remote work treatment

This is the live audit issue for tax years 2020 onward. **Michigan
Treasury's official position** (per the FAQ at michigan.gov/taxes
covid19-tele, and the EY Tax News 2023-0758 summary):

> A non-resident employee who telecommutes from a location **outside**
> Detroit does **not** owe Detroit tax on compensation for days worked
> from that outside location, even if the employer is based in Detroit.

This means the standard apportionment is honored: a non-resident who
spent 60 days physically in the Detroit office and 180 days working from
their home in Royal Oak in 2025 would apportion 60/240 = 25% of their
salary to Detroit.

**However**, Detroit does **not** apply the "convenience of the employer"
rule used by New York and Pennsylvania. The work-from-home days for the
employer's convenience are still treated as days outside Detroit.

The corollary the Treasury emphasizes (Regulation 13.2 of the legacy
Detroit Income Tax Ordinance, carried forward): **"The mere fact that a
non-resident employee takes work home with them and performs such work
at their home does not permit allocation of compensation."** This applies
to **occasional** off-hours work at home — a non-resident who normally
works in the Detroit office and answers email evenings/weekends from
home in the suburbs cannot claim those off-hours as "days outside
Detroit." The allocation requires that the home location be the
**regular, scheduled** work location for entire workdays.

### Documentation required for non-resident allocation < 100%

| Documentation | Source |
|---|---|
| Employer letter listing actual days in Detroit vs. days at remote location | Form 5119 instructions; Form 5121 |
| Work-log / calendar / timesheet evidence | Treasury audit guidance |
| W-2 box 20 city code (`DET` or `DETRO`) reconciliation to Form 5121 | Form 5121 Part 3 |

Without contemporaneous documentation, Treasury defaults to **100%
Detroit-source** apportionment for any W-2 showing Detroit withholding.
This is a frequent audit adjustment.

### Honigman v. City of Detroit (Mich. 2020) — sourcing rule for services

In *Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP v. City of Detroit*, 505 Mich
284 (2020), the Michigan Supreme Court adopted an **origin-based sourcing
rule** under MCL 141.623 for the sales factor used in business
apportionment. The Court held that services rendered by attorneys
physically working in the Detroit office were Detroit sales **regardless
of where the client was located**.

**Implication for self-employed non-residents:** if a non-resident sole
proprietor performs services at a Detroit work location (e.g., a freelance
software developer who commutes into a Detroit co-working space or
client site), the income attributable to that physical work in Detroit
is Detroit-source — even if the client is in California. This origin-
based sourcing is the city analog of the more familiar "where the
service is performed" rule.

Conversely, a non-resident who performs all work remotely from their
home outside Detroit, billing Detroit-based clients, has **no Detroit-
source income** from those services, because no physical work occurs in
Detroit. *Honigman* supports this conclusion by negative implication.

---

## Section 7: Self-employed taxpayer treatment

### Schedule C net profit — resident

A full-year Detroit resident sole proprietor reports the full federal
Schedule C net profit on Form 5118 (after subtracting the ½ SE tax
deduction and SE health insurance) at 2.4%. There is no apportionment —
residents are taxed on worldwide income.

### Schedule C net profit — non-resident: Form 5327 business allocation

A non-resident sole proprietor with any Detroit business activity must
file **Form 5327 — Business Income Apportionment Schedule**. Form 5327
computes the in-city percentage as the average of three factors
(MCL 141.621–141.624):

| Factor | Numerator | Denominator |
|---|---|---|
| Property | Avg. cost of real and tangible personal property used in business **in Detroit** | Total avg. cost of all business property |
| Payroll | Total compensation paid to employees for work done **in Detroit** | Total compensation paid to all employees |
| Sales / receipts | Gross revenue from **services performed in Detroit** (origin-based per *Honigman*) and from sales delivered to a Detroit destination | Total gross revenue |

```
Business allocation % = (Property% + Payroll% + Sales%) / 3
```

If a taxpayer has **no payroll** (one-person consultancy) or **no
property** (no fixed location), the denominator of the average is reduced
to exclude factors with both numerator and denominator zero (a "missing-
factor" adjustment, MCL 141.624).

For a typical solo freelance software developer with **no employees,
no Detroit real estate, and all work done remotely from a home office
outside Detroit**, all three factors will be zero in Detroit, and the
allocation will be 0%. No Detroit tax is owed on the Schedule C even if
some clients are Detroit-based.

### Home office consideration

The home office must be located **inside Detroit city limits** for any
allocation to Detroit to result from home-based work. Verify the
address against the Detroit boundary as described in Section 3.

---

## Section 8: Credits

### Credit for tax paid to another Michigan city (resident only)

A full-year Detroit resident who earns wages or business income taxed by
**another** Michigan city (Grand Rapids, Lansing, Flint, Pontiac, Hamtramck,
Highland Park, etc.) receives a non-refundable credit on Form 5118.

```
Credit = lesser of:
  (a) the other city's tax actually paid on the doubly-taxed income, or
  (b) Detroit's 2.4% tax on the same doubly-taxed income.
```

This credit prevents double city-level taxation but does not refund any
excess. Note: this is **not** a credit for Michigan state tax (no such
credit exists at the city level) and not a credit for federal tax.

### Detroit homestead property tax credit

Detroit does **not** offer a city-level homestead property tax credit on
the Detroit return. The Michigan state-level credit is claimed on
Form MI-1040CR (the Homestead Property Tax Credit) filed with the
Michigan state return, not with Form 5118. Some practitioner guides
conflate this — be careful. `[VERIFY:]` Confirm against TY 2025 5313 City
Book that no new Detroit-specific homestead credit has been introduced
for 2025.

### Renaissance Zone deduction (effectively a credit)

Designated Detroit Renaissance Zones (e.g., portions of Midtown, the
Eastern Market area, and several industrial zones — see City of Detroit
Planning Department list) qualify residents and businesses located in
the Zone for an income tax abatement under MCL 125.2681 et seq. The
abatement phases out in the last three years of the Zone's designation.
This is taken as a deduction line on Form 5118, not a tax credit.

## Section 9: Tier 1 deterministic rules + Tier 2 judgment rules

### Tier 1 — deterministic

| Rule ID | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| DET-T1-01 | Resident rate = 2.4%; Non-resident rate = 1.2% (TY 2025) | MCL 141.611; Detroit Ordinance |
| DET-T1-02 | Personal exemption = $600 per individual / dependent (TY 2025) | Form 5118 (2025) |
| DET-T1-03 | Filing deadline = April 15 of the year following the tax year | MCL 141.671 |
| DET-T1-04 | Resident is taxed on income wherever earned; non-resident is taxed only on Detroit-source income | MCL 141.612, 141.613 |
| DET-T1-05 | Social Security, unemployment compensation, military pay, pensions, IRA / 401(k) distributions are excluded from Detroit base | Detroit Ordinance — retirement exclusion |
| DET-T1-06 | Non-resident interest, dividends, and intangible-asset capital gains are NOT Detroit-source | MCL 141.613 |
| DET-T1-07 | Non-resident wage apportionment uses days-actually-worked-in-Detroit / total-work-days | Form 5121 Part 3; MCL 141.612 |
| DET-T1-08 | Resident gets credit for tax paid to another Michigan city, capped at Detroit's 2.4% on same income | Form 5118 credit line; MCL 141.689 |
| DET-T1-09 | Estimated tax required if expected liability after withholding ≥ $100 | Form 5123 instructions |
| DET-T1-10 | Forms: 5118 (Resident), 5119 (Non-Resident), 5120 (Part-Year). Form 5121 attached if any W-2 city withholding. | Treasury 2025 City Book |
| DET-T1-11 | Federal extension does NOT extend Detroit return — Form 5209 required | Form 5209 instructions |
| DET-T1-12 | Origin-based sourcing for service revenue under *Honigman* (2020) | 505 Mich 284 |

### Tier 2 — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| DET-T2-01 | **Detroit-vs-Michigan domicile** — taxpayer can be a Michigan resident and Detroit non-resident, or vice versa. Verify physical address against Detroit boundary (City Assessor parcel map). Highland Park and Hamtramck are NOT Detroit. | Use Detroit Open Data parcel viewer to confirm. |
| DET-T2-02 | **Remote work allocation** — non-resident working some days at Detroit office and some days at home in suburbs allocates by actual days. Treasury does NOT apply convenience-of-employer doctrine. Documentation (employer letter, calendar) required to support < 100%. | Without docs, audit default is 100% Detroit. |
| DET-T2-03 | **"Occasional work at home" trap** — Regulation 13.2 still bars allocation for incidental off-hours email/calls from home. The home must be the regular full-day work location. | Distinguish full-time WFH from "took work home." |
| DET-T2-04 | **Spouse in different residency status** — if one spouse is a Detroit resident and the other is not, they must file Detroit returns separately (Form 5118 for the resident; Form 5119 for the non-resident if they have Detroit-source income). They cannot file a joint Detroit return combining both residencies. | Use separate filing statuses on each form. |
| DET-T2-05 | **Part-year residency split date** — use actual move-in / move-out date. Income received before move-in date that was earned during a period of non-residency stays in the non-resident bucket. | Cash-basis allocation. |
| DET-T2-06 | **S-corp distributive share** — Detroit treats S-corps as separate taxable entities (NOT flow-through to shareholders for city tax purposes — different from federal). The S-corp pays Detroit corporate income tax on the entity's apportioned income; the resident shareholder is generally not double-taxed on the K-1 ordinary income. | This is a significant Detroit-specific deviation from federal pass-through. Flag for reviewer. `[VERIFY:]` Detroit Ordinance §6 and current treatment. |
| DET-T2-07 | **Partnership distributive share** — Detroit follows the federal flow-through treatment for partnerships. Resident partners include full distributive share; non-resident partners include Detroit-apportioned share via Form 5327 at the partnership level. | Different from S-corp treatment. |
| DET-T2-08 | **Renaissance Zone qualification** — depends on physical residence/business location within a designated Zone for the full taxable year and on Zone phase-out schedule. | Verify Zone status with Detroit Planning Dept. |
| DET-T2-09 | **Multi-Michigan-city situation** — resident of Detroit working in Grand Rapids: claim credit on Form 5118. Non-resident of Detroit working partly in Detroit and partly in Lansing: file Form 5119 for Detroit days, file Lansing's CF-1040 separately for Lansing days. | Separate non-resident returns for each city. |
| DET-T2-10 | **Estimated tax safe harbors** — Detroit has no statutory safe-harbor structure as detailed as the federal §6654; Treasury historically waives penalty if total payments ≥ prior year's liability and ≥ 70% of current year. | `[VERIFY:]` current safe-harbor mechanics from Form 5338 instructions. |

## Section 10: Worked examples

### Example 1 — Detroit resident sole prop with all-Detroit clients

**Facts.** Maya is a freelance software developer, single, age 34, domiciled
year-round in a rented apartment on East Lafayette Street, Detroit
(verified within Detroit city limits). She runs a single-member LLC
disregarded for federal tax. 2025 federal Schedule C net profit:
$110,000. She has no W-2 income. She paid $7,773 of ½ SE tax deduction and
$8,400 of self-employed health insurance.

**Detroit computation (Form 5118).**

| Line | Item | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Federal AGI (from Form 1040 Line 11) | $93,827 |
| | Subtractions (none — no pensions, SS, etc.) | $0 |
| | Additions (none) | $0 |
| | Detroit AGI | $93,827 |
| | Less: personal exemption (1 × $600) | $(600) |
| | Detroit taxable income | $93,227 |
| | Detroit tax @ 2.4% | $2,237 |

No credit for tax paid to other city. No Detroit withholding. Full $2,237
owed on Form 5118, due April 15, 2026. Maya should have been making
quarterly estimates on Form 5123 because liability exceeded $100.

### Example 2 — Detroit resident employee at a Detroit firm

**Facts.** Marcus, married filing jointly, age 41, domiciled in a single-
family home on Conant Street, Detroit. His spouse Tasha is also a Detroit
resident. Marcus earns $82,000 W-2 wages from a Detroit-headquartered
employer; Detroit withholding (Box 19) of $1,968. Tasha earns $46,000 W-2
from an employer in Warren, MI (no Detroit withholding — Warren has no
city income tax). They have two minor children. No other income.

**Detroit computation (Form 5118 — joint).**

| Line | Item | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Federal AGI | $128,000 |
| | Additions / subtractions | $0 |
| | Detroit AGI | $128,000 |
| | Less: personal exemptions (4 × $600) | $(2,400) |
| | Detroit taxable income | $125,600 |
| | Detroit tax @ 2.4% | $3,014 |
| | Less: Detroit withholding (Form 5121) | $(1,968) |
| | Balance due | $1,046 |

Because both spouses are Detroit residents, both incomes are taxed at the
2.4% resident rate. Tasha's Warren wages are fully taxable to Detroit
because Warren imposes no offsetting city tax (no credit available).

### Example 3 — Non-resident sole prop with some Detroit clients (apportionment edge case)

**Facts.** Priya is a freelance UX designer domiciled in Ferndale, MI
(outside Detroit). Single, age 29. 2025 federal Schedule C net profit:
$95,000. She works from her Ferndale home office most days, but spent
**32 full days** physically at a client site in Detroit (an automotive
firm in the New Center area), where she conducted user-testing sessions.
She has no employees and no business property in Detroit. Total work
days for the year: 230.

**Apportionment analysis (Form 5327).**

| Factor | Numerator | Denominator | Percentage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Property | $0 (no Detroit business property) | ~$2,000 (home office equipment, all in Ferndale) | 0% |
| Payroll | $0 (no employees) | $0 (no employees) | Excluded (missing factor) |
| Sales / receipts (services) | Services performed in Detroit = revenue earned on the 32 days physically in Detroit (origin-based per *Honigman*); estimate revenue tied to those 32 days ≈ $95,000 × (32/230) = $13,217 | $95,000 | 13.9% |

```
Apportionment % = (0% + 13.9%) / 2 = 6.96%
```

(Payroll factor excluded because both numerator and denominator are zero;
the average is taken over the remaining two factors per MCL 141.624.)

**Detroit computation (Form 5119).**

| Line | Item | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| | Schedule C net profit | $95,000 |
| | Less: ½ SE tax deduction | $(6,712) |
| | Less: SE health insurance | $(6,000) |
| | Net business income | $82,288 |
| | × Detroit apportionment 6.96% | $5,727 |
| | Less: personal exemption (1 × $600) | $(600) |
| | Detroit taxable income | $5,127 |
| | Detroit tax @ 1.2% | $62 |

Below the $100 threshold for required estimated payments. Priya should
**keep contemporaneous records** (Detroit client engagement letter,
calendar, mileage log, client sign-in records) to support the 32 days
during any audit. Without documentation, Treasury may default the
apportionment to 100% Detroit-source ($82,288 × 1.2% = $987), a ~$925
adjustment.

## Section 11: Refusal catalogue

| ID | Situation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| DET-R-01 | Multi-state apportionment beyond Michigan (e.g., taxpayer also has income sourced to Ohio, Illinois) | Refuse — out of scope; refer to a multi-state practitioner |
| DET-R-02 | Ownership of a partnership or S-corp with operations in multiple Michigan cities (Detroit + Grand Rapids + Lansing) | Refuse — multi-city apportionment requires entity-level review |
| DET-R-03 | Detroit corporate income tax (Form 5297 / 5301) — this skill is individual only | Refuse — separate skill required |
| DET-R-04 | Amended Detroit return (Form 5118-X equivalent) | Refuse — out of scope; refer to reviewer |
| DET-R-05 | Detroit casino gaming winnings allocation for non-residents | Refuse — narrow specialty; refer to reviewer |
| DET-R-06 | Renaissance Zone qualification dispute or Zone phase-out year mechanics | Refuse — refer to Detroit Planning Dept. and reviewer |
| DET-R-07 | Estate / trust filing a Detroit return (Form 5462) | Refuse — fiduciary filing out of scope |
| DET-R-08 | Highland Park, Hamtramck, or other Michigan city return (not Detroit) | Refuse — different jurisdiction; use city's own forms |
| DET-R-09 | Tax year other than the current TY 2025 | Refuse — rates and forms may differ; verify against year-specific Treasury instructions |
| DET-R-10 | "Convenience of employer" argument by a Detroit employer for an out-of-state remote worker | Refuse — not applicable in Michigan; flag as an audit risk if it arises |
| DET-R-11 | Detroit residency dispute with the City Assessor / Treasury (boundary question, multiple homes) | Refuse — refer to reviewer; gather documentary evidence first |
| DET-R-12 | S-corp K-1 with mixed-location business activity owned by Detroit resident | Refuse — Detroit's separate-entity treatment of S-corps requires entity-level analysis (see DET-T2-06) |

## Section 13: Provenance and self-checks

### Provenance

- All rates, exemption amounts, and form names sourced from the Michigan
  Department of Treasury 2025 City of Detroit Individual Income Tax
  Returns Forms and Instructions (Form 5313 City Book).
- Statutory citations to the Uniform City Income Tax Act (MCL 141.501–
  141.787) and Detroit-specific provisions of that Act.
- Case law citation to *Honigman Miller Schwartz and Cohn LLP v. City of
  Detroit*, 505 Mich 284 (2020).
- Treasury policy on remote-work apportionment sourced from the official
  Treasury FAQ (michigan.gov/taxes COVID-19 telecommuting accordion) and
  cross-checked against EY Tax News 2023-0758 secondary summary.

### Self-checks before completing a Detroit return

1. Verify residency by **physical street address** against Detroit
   boundary — not by ZIP code, not by "metro Detroit."
2. Confirm form choice: 5118 (resident) / 5119 (non-resident) / 5120
   (part-year) matches actual residency history.
3. If W-2 shows Box 19 Detroit withholding, attach Form 5121.
4. If non-resident allocating < 100% Detroit, confirm employer letter
   and day-by-day documentation are in client file.
5. If self-employed non-resident, confirm Form 5327 factors are
   computed and supported.
6. Confirm Detroit subtractions for pensions, IRA, Social Security,
   unemployment, military pay where applicable.
7. Confirm personal exemption ($600 × dependent count) is claimed.
8. Confirm no double-counting against MI-1040 (Detroit return is
   independent — does not flow to or from MI-1040).
9. Confirm federal extension was not relied on for Detroit deadline —
   if extension needed, Form 5209 must be on file.
10. Confirm quarterly estimated payments were made if prior year
    liability exceeded $100.

### Known uncertainties — `[VERIFY:]`

- Exact underpayment penalty form number for TY 2025 (5125 vs 5338) —
  confirm against current Treasury form catalogue.
- S-corp shareholder treatment for Detroit resident — Detroit Ordinance
  §6 historically treated S-corps as separate taxable entities, but
  practice may have evolved; confirm before relying on DET-T2-06.
- Whether the Detroit homestead-credit equivalent exists at the city
  level for TY 2025 — confirmed absent in older years but `[VERIFY:]`
  against current City Book.
- Treatment of gambling winnings from Detroit casinos for non-residents
  — confirm against MCL 141.613(g) and current Treasury policy.
- Detroit estimated-tax safe-harbor structure (prior-year vs current-
  year) — confirm against Form 5338 instructions for TY 2025.
