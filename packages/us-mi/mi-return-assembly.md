name: mi-return-assembly
description: >
  Final capstone orchestrator that assembles the complete federal + Michigan
  filing package for a full-year Michigan-resident sole proprietor or
  single-member LLC disregarded for federal tax. Consumes outputs from every
  upstream federal and Michigan content skill (bookkeeping, Schedule C/SE,
  QBI, retirement, SE health insurance, quarterly estimated tax, federal
  assembly, 1099-NEC, MI-1040 income tax, MI-1040ES estimates, Form 4884
  pension subtraction, MI-1040CR / CR-7 credits, and Detroit Form 5118 where
  applicable) to produce a single unified reviewer package: every worksheet,
  every form, every cross-skill reconciliation, the final taxpayer action
  list with payment and filing instructions, the next-year MI-1040ES voucher
  schedule, and the reviewer brief. This skill does NOT recompute tax — it
  ORCHESTRATES. Trigger on phrases like "assemble the Michigan return",
  "final MI package", "MI-1040 reviewer package", "Detroit return package",
  or "Michigan return assembly". MUST be loaded alongside us-tax-workflow-base
  v0.2 or later and every content skill listed in Section 5. Michigan
  full-year residents only.

# Michigan Return Assembly Skill — Capstone Orchestrator

> **Scope.** This is THE skill that runs LAST. Every other skill in the
> Michigan stack feeds into this one. The output is the complete reviewer
> package that a credentialed reviewer (Enrolled Agent, CPA, or attorney
> under Circular 230) signs off on before the return goes to the taxpayer
> or to Michigan Treasury.
>
> This skill does **not** compute anything new. Its job is to verify that
> every upstream skill ran, every upstream self-check passed, every
> cross-skill reconciliation holds, and the package is internally consistent.
>
> **Quality tier.** Q3 — AI-drafted, not independently verified. Researched
> 2026-05-28 against Michigan Department of Treasury, City of Detroit
> Income Tax Division, and IRS publications. A qualified professional must
> review before filing.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, intake has already happened. The taxpayer has
consented to the full workflow. Execute every step without pausing for
permission.**

- **Do NOT ask the user "how deep do you want me to go".** The taxpayer asked
  for a Michigan return. Produce it.
- **Do NOT announce tool budgets or token counts.** Execute.
- **Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize.** Produce every deliverable
  listed in Section 7. If you run out of context, finish the numbers first,
  then produce whatever formatted outputs you can, and state honestly at the
  end which deliverables are partial.
- **Do NOT re-validate scope intake already validated.** Residency, business
  structure, filing status, Detroit nexus, age, dependents — all of that
  came from intake. Cross-check specific numbers during reconciliation but
  do not re-interrogate the taxpayer.
- **Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.** Run them in order
  (Section 5) without prose updates between each one. One status message
  at the end is enough.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** A failed self-check is a flag
  in the reviewer brief, not a workflow halt. The reviewer handles edges.
- **Primary citations live in the final reviewer brief, not in intermediate
  computation.** Don't stop to cite MCL 206.51 mid-rate-multiplication.

**Failure mode to avoid:** halting mid-execution to ask a meta-question
about workflow pacing. That is disqualifying. If you feel the urge to ask
"how should I proceed," pick the most defensible path, proceed, and flag
the decision for the reviewer.

## Section 2 — What this skill is

The final capstone skill. Every other Michigan skill and every relevant
federal skill feeds into this one. The deliverable is the complete reviewer
package that a credentialed reviewer signs off on before filing.

The skill enforces three things:

1. **Order of operations.** Federal first, Michigan second, Detroit (if
   applicable) third. The order is non-negotiable because federal AGI flows
   into MI-1040 Line 10, and Michigan AGI flows into Detroit Form 5118.
2. **Cross-skill reconciliation.** Every figure that appears on the MI-1040
   must match the corresponding figure produced by the source skill. A
   mismatch halts assembly with a specific, named refusal.
3. **Reviewer-grade output.** The final package is structured for a CPA or
   EA to review in under 30 minutes: cover summary, brief, exhibits in
   order, action list, citations.

---

## Section 3 — Orchestration runbook

When invoked, the agent executes the following steps in order. No step is
optional. No step is skipped without an explicit refusal.

### Step 1 — Confirm intake artifact exists

Verify the intake skill (the Michigan equivalent of `us-ca-freelance-intake`,
or generic intake if no MI-specific intake exists) has produced:

- Taxpayer name, SSN/ITIN (last 4 only in working files)
- Filing status (Single / MFJ / MFS / HoH / QSS)
- Residency confirmation (full-year Michigan)
- Date of birth for taxpayer and spouse (drives Form 4884 tier)
- Dependents list with SSNs
- Business structure (sole prop or SMLLC disregarded)
- City of residence (drives Detroit / Grand Rapids / other city nexus)
- City of work, if different from residence
- Coverage of dependents (for federal Schedule 8812 etc.)

If any item is missing, refuse with **R-MI-FINAL-5**.

### Step 2 — Confirm federal skills ran and produced outputs

Verify in order:

1. `us-sole-prop-bookkeeping` — Schedule C classification with reconciled
   bank ledger.
2. `us-schedule-c-and-se-computation` — Schedule C bottom line, Form 8829,
   Schedule SE.
3. `us-self-employed-retirement` — SEP / Solo 401(k) contribution and
   Schedule 1 Line 16 amount.
4. `us-self-employed-health-insurance` — §162(l) deduction and Schedule 1
   Line 17 amount (with iterative PTC convergence if marketplace coverage).
5. `us-qbi-deduction` — Form 8995 or 8995-A, deduction to Form 1040 Line 13.
6. `us-federal-return-assembly` — Form 1040, Schedules 1, 2, 3, all
   supporting forms, federal total tax, federal balance due / refund.
7. `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` — Form 2210 (if penalty) + 2026 Form 1040-ES
   schedule.
8. `us-1099-nec-issuance` — Parallel; only needs bookkeeping. Contractor list
   plus W-9 gaps.

If any is missing or its self-checks did not pass, refuse with
**R-MI-FINAL-1** or **R-MI-FINAL-2** naming the specific skill.

### Step 3 — Confirm Michigan skills ran

Execute in order:

1. `mi-income-tax` — MI-1040, Schedule 1 (MI), Schedule W. Produces Michigan
   AGI, Michigan taxable income, Michigan tax at 4.25%, credits, refund or
   balance due.
2. `mi-pension-retirement-subtraction` — Form 4884, if any taxpayer or
   spouse is born before 1953 or has pension / IRA / 401(k) distributions
   reported on federal Form 1099-R. Skip if N/A but record the skip.
3. `mi-estimated-tax` (if a separate skill exists) OR derive next-year
   MI-1040ES vouchers from `mi-income-tax` Section 4. Produces a 4-payment
   schedule for 2026 if expected liability exceeds $500.
4. `mi-homestead-credit` (MI-1040CR) — If taxpayer is homeowner or renter
   and household resources are within the credit threshold. Skip if N/A.
5. `mi-home-heating-credit` (MI-1040CR-7) — If household resources qualify
   and home heating costs are documented. Skip if N/A.

If any required skill failed or its self-check failed, refuse with
**R-MI-FINAL-1** or **R-MI-FINAL-2**.

### Step 4 — Confirm city-level skill ran if Detroit nexus exists

If intake flagged Detroit residence OR Detroit work nexus:

- Detroit resident → `mi-detroit-individual-return` produces Form 5118 +
  Form 5121 (City Schedule W). Resident rate 2.4%.
- Detroit non-resident worker → refuse with **R-MI-FINAL-7**; non-resident
  city returns are out of scope for this orchestrator.
- Grand Rapids resident → currently refused (no `mi-grand-rapids-return`
  skill in the stack). Refuse with **R-MI-FINAL-8**.
- Other 22 taxing cities → refused with **R-MI-FINAL-9**.

### Step 5 — Run the verification matrix

Run every check in Section 6. Each check is a specific equality between a
number on a final form and the source-of-truth output from the producing
skill. A failure halts assembly with **R-MI-FINAL-3**.

### Step 6 — Aggregate artifacts

Pull:
- Every "Assumed" entry from every upstream skill into the **assumption log**.
- Every "Taxpayer input needed" item into the **taxpayer input log**.
- Every "Reviewer judgment needed" item into the **reviewer flag log**.
- Every refusal that fired anywhere in the chain into the **refusal log**.

### Step 7 — Compose the deliverables

Produce the three output files specified in Section 7. Place them in
`/mnt/user-data/outputs/`. Present them at the end with `present_files`.

### Step 8 — Final status message

A single message stating: which skills ran, which self-checks passed, which
deliverables were produced, any partial deliverables and why. Done.

---

## Section 4 — Pre-flight checks

Before any of Section 3 runs, the orchestrator confirms these gating
conditions. If any fail, refuse — do not partially execute.

| Check | Question | Refusal if fails |
|---|---|---|
| PF-1 | Has federal Form 1040 been computed by `us-federal-return-assembly`? | R-MI-FINAL-1 |
| PF-2 | Is federal AGI (Form 1040 Line 11) a finite, signed number? | R-MI-FINAL-1 |
| PF-3 | Has the taxpayer's full-year Michigan residency been confirmed? | R-MI-FINAL-6 |
| PF-4 | Is the business structure sole prop or SMLLC disregarded? S-corp or partnership? | R-MI-FINAL-10 / R-MI-FINAL-11 |
| PF-5 | Is the tax year 2025? | R-MI-FINAL-12 |
| PF-6 | If Detroit nexus: is the taxpayer a Detroit resident (not just a non-resident worker)? | R-MI-FINAL-7 |
| PF-7 | If MFJ: are both spouses Michigan full-year residents? Mixed-residency couples → refuse. | R-MI-FINAL-13 |
| PF-8 | Is this a current-year original return (not amended)? | R-MI-FINAL-14 |

---

## Section 5 — Skill-loading order (canonical execution sequence)

This is the immutable order. Do not parallelize; downstream skills consume
upstream outputs. The single exception is `us-1099-nec-issuance`, which can
run in parallel with anything after `us-sole-prop-bookkeeping`.

```
1.  us-tax-workflow-base                         (workflow scaffold)
2.  us-sole-prop-bookkeeping                     (Schedule C classification)
3.  us-schedule-c-and-se-computation             (C, SE, 8829)
4.  us-qbi-deduction                             (8995 / 8995-A)
5.  us-self-employed-health-insurance            (§162(l), iterative w/ PTC)
6.  us-self-employed-retirement                  (SEP / Solo 401(k))
7.  us-quarterly-estimated-tax                   (2210, 2026 1040-ES)
8.  us-federal-return-assembly                   (1040, Sch 1/2/3, sign-off)
9.  us-1099-nec-issuance                         (parallel; contractor batch)
10. mi-income-tax                                (MI-1040, MI Sch 1, Sch W)
11. mi-pension-retirement-subtraction            (Form 4884 — if applicable)
12. mi-estimated-tax / MI-1040ES (2026)          (next-year vouchers)
13. mi-homestead-credit (MI-1040CR)              (if applicable)
14. mi-home-heating-credit (MI-1040CR-7)         (if applicable)
15. mi-detroit-individual-return (Form 5118)     (if Detroit resident)
16. mi-return-assembly                           ← THIS SKILL
```

Each upstream skill is expected to expose, at minimum: (a) the line-item
output(s) it produces, (b) the self-check log, (c) any refusals fired, and
(d) any reviewer / taxpayer flags. The orchestrator consumes those four
artifacts per skill.

## Section 6 — Verification matrix (reconciliations)

Every line below is a hard equality. Tolerance is $1 unless noted otherwise.
A failure halts assembly with **R-MI-FINAL-3** naming the specific check.

### 6A — Federal internal consistency (re-verified)

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| F-1 | Schedule C Line 31 = Schedule 1 Line 3 = Form 1040 Line 8 (via Sch 1 to L10) | us-schedule-c-and-se-computation |
| F-2 | Schedule SE Line 12 = Schedule 2 Line 4 | us-schedule-c-and-se-computation |
| F-3 | Schedule SE Line 13 = Schedule 1 Line 15 | us-schedule-c-and-se-computation |
| F-4 | SEP / Solo 401(k) employer + employee = Schedule 1 Line 16 | us-self-employed-retirement |
| F-5 | §162(l) deduction = Schedule 1 Line 17 | us-self-employed-health-insurance |
| F-6 | QBI deduction = Form 1040 Line 13 | us-qbi-deduction |
| F-7 | Total tax = Form 1040 Line 24 | us-federal-return-assembly |
| F-8 | Form 2210 penalty (if any) = Schedule 2 Line 8 | us-quarterly-estimated-tax |
| F-9 | Total payments = Form 1040 Line 33 | us-federal-return-assembly |
| F-10 | Refund / balance due = Form 1040 Line 34 or 37 | us-federal-return-assembly |

### 6B — Michigan internal consistency

| Check | Equation | Source-of-truth skill |
|---|---|---|
| M-1 | Federal AGI (Form 1040 Line 11) = MI-1040 Line 10 | mi-income-tax |
| M-2 | MI Schedule 1 additions total = MI-1040 Line 11 | mi-income-tax |
| M-3 | MI Schedule 1 subtractions total = MI-1040 Line 13 | mi-income-tax |
| M-4 | Michigan AGI = MI-1040 Line 14 | mi-income-tax |
| M-5 | Personal exemptions × $5,800 (2026 — verify 2025 figure $5,600 from MI-1040 Book) = MI-1040 Line 15 | mi-income-tax |
| M-6 | Michigan taxable income = MI-1040 Line 16 | mi-income-tax |
| M-7 | MI-1040 Line 17 = Line 16 × 4.25% | mi-income-tax |
| M-8 | Form 4884 total (if applicable) = MI Schedule 1 Line 25 | mi-pension-retirement-subtraction |
| M-9 | Schedule W total withholding = MI-1040 Line 29 | mi-income-tax |
| M-10 | MI-1040CR credit (if applicable) = MI-1040 Line 25 | mi-homestead-credit |
| M-11 | MI EITC (30% of federal EITC) = MI-1040 Line 27a | mi-income-tax |
| M-12 | Refund / balance due = MI-1040 Line 32 or 33 | mi-income-tax |

### 6C — Federal-Michigan coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| C-1 | Filing status on MI-1040 = filing status on Form 1040 |
| C-2 | Number of exemptions on MI-1040 = federal dependents + 1 (self) or +2 (MFJ self+spouse) + dependents |
| C-3 | Schedule C net profit federally = Schedule C net profit feeding MI AGI |
| C-4 | Federal §168(k) bonus depreciation = Michigan depreciation (Michigan conforms; no add-back) |
| C-5 | Federal §179 = Michigan §179 (Michigan conforms; no cap difference) |
| C-6 | Federal SE tax deduction (Schedule 1 Line 15) is reflected in federal AGI; no MI add-back |
| C-7 | Federal QBI deduction does NOT flow into MI computation (MI starts at federal AGI, before QBI); confirm no double-counting |
| C-8 | Federal SE health insurance deduction is included in federal AGI; no MI add-back |
| C-9 | Federal Social Security includible income (Form 1040 Line 6b) → MI Schedule 1 subtraction (fully exempt) |
| C-10 | U.S. government bond interest in federal Schedule B → MI Schedule 1 subtraction |
| C-11 | Non-Michigan state/muni bond interest in federal Schedule B → MI Schedule 1 addition |

### 6D — Michigan-Detroit coordination (if applicable)

| Check | Equation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| D-1 | Detroit resident filing status matches MI-1040 filing status | Form 5118 |
| D-2 | Detroit gross income source schedule reconciles to federal Schedule C + W-2 + other federal income lines | Form 5118 + Form 5121 |
| D-3 | Detroit exemptions = $600 × number of exemptions claimed on MI-1040 | Form 5118 |
| D-4 | Detroit resident tax = (Detroit taxable income) × 2.4% | Form 5118 |
| D-5 | Detroit Schedule W withholding total = Detroit Form 5118 city withholding line | Form 5121 → 5118 |
| D-6 | Detroit refund / balance due reconciles to net of tax minus withholding minus estimates | Form 5118 |

### 6E — 1099-NEC reconciliation

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| N-1 | Sum of NEC payments flagged = Schedule C Line 11 (Contract labor) + any direct labor lines |
| N-2 | Each contractor with $600+ has W-9 on file; gaps surfaced in flag log |
| N-3 | Filing deadline noted (January 31, 2026; if past, late-filing penalty surfaced) |

### 6F — Estimated-tax coordination

| Check | Equation |
|---|---|
| E-1 | 2026 federal Q1 voucher = `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` Q1 output |
| E-2 | 2026 MI-1040ES Q1 voucher = (mi-estimated-tax or mi-income-tax) Q1 output |
| E-3 | Q1 federal + Q1 MI together do not exceed taxpayer's stated cash availability flag (if intake captured one) |
| E-4 | 2026 MI safe harbor (110% of 2025 MI tax if 2025 AGI > $150K, else 100%) is met by the prescribed voucher schedule |

    progression as birth years roll forward, Detroit move-in/move-out risk.
12. **Taxpayer Action List** — Embedded copy of File 3.

### 7C — File 3: `taxpayer_action_list.md`

Step-by-step action list, structured by date. The taxpayer reads this file

## Section 8 — The reviewer brief (narrative format)

This is the document the CPA reads first. It should be readable in under
30 minutes and give the reviewer enough context to either sign off or
identify exactly what needs more work.

The brief follows this fixed structure:

## Section 9 — Tier 1 deterministic rules

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| MI-ASM-T1-01 | Federal Form 1040 must be computed before MI-1040. No exceptions. |
| MI-ASM-T1-02 | MI-1040 Line 10 (AGI starting point) must exactly equal Form 1040 Line 11. |
| MI-ASM-T1-03 | Michigan tax = (MI-1040 Line 16) × 0.0425. Always. |
| MI-ASM-T1-04 | Personal exemption is multiplied by the number of exemptions on MI-1040 Line 9. |
| MI-ASM-T1-05 | The April 15, 2026 filing deadline applies unless taxpayer is granted federal extension, in which case MI accepts the federal extension automatically (no separate MI extension form for the time-to-file). |
| MI-ASM-T1-06 | Extension to file is NOT extension to pay. Any MI balance due is still due April 15. |
| MI-ASM-T1-07 | Form 4884 is required if any Form 1099-R distribution is reported federally, unless the distribution is fully exempt under another rule. |
| MI-ASM-T1-08 | Detroit resident return (Form 5118) is mandatory for any Detroit resident at any time during the tax year, even with zero Detroit-source income. |
| MI-ASM-T1-09 | MI estimated-tax payments are required if expected MI tax after withholding exceeds $500 (MI-1040 instructions). |
| MI-ASM-T1-10 | MI safe harbor for the 2210 equivalent: 100% of prior-year MI tax (110% if 2025 AGI > $150,000) OR 90% of current-year. |
| MI-ASM-T1-11 | Michigan conforms to federal IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation and §179. No state add-back. |
| MI-ASM-T1-12 | Michigan does NOT recognize the federal §199A QBI deduction in any Michigan adjustment. MI starts at federal AGI, BEFORE QBI, so QBI never touches MI computation. |
| MI-ASM-T1-13 | Michigan EITC is 30% of the federal EITC (refundable). |
| MI-ASM-T1-14 | Three-file deliverable structure (xlsx + brief.md + actions.md) is mandatory. |

---

## Section 10 — Tier 2 judgment rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| MI-ASM-T2-01 | **Materiality threshold for reconciliation failures.** A $1 rounding gap is not a failure; a $50 gap is. | Reviewer judgment on the threshold; default $5 for federal-MI tie-outs, $1 for intra-form. |
| MI-ASM-T2-02 | **Order of city-tax filing if multiple cities.** If a Detroit resident also worked in Grand Rapids, both city returns may be needed. | Refuse this scenario at the orchestrator level (R-MI-FINAL-9) and route to professional. |
| MI-ASM-T2-03 | **Form 4884 tier election under PA 4 of 2023 / "Lowering MI Costs Plan".** The phase-in lets taxpayers elect the most favorable tier in a given year. | Defer to `mi-pension-retirement-subtraction` for the election logic; orchestrator only verifies the chosen tier flowed correctly. |
| MI-ASM-T2-04 | **MI-1040CR claim when household resources are close to the threshold.** Mid-year income changes may push household resources above/below. | If household resources are within 5% of threshold, flag for reviewer judgment. |
| MI-ASM-T2-05 | **Reciprocal-state wages.** If the taxpayer earned wages in IL/IN/KY/MN/OH/WI, verify withholding was directed to MI (not the work state). | If withholding went to the wrong state, flag for resident-credit claim under MCL 206.255 (handled by `mi-income-tax`); orchestrator surfaces the flag. |
| MI-ASM-T2-06 | **Self-employment apportionment if work performed outside MI.** If the sole prop performed work outside MI for non-MI customers, all Schedule C income may still be MI source if the taxpayer is a MI resident. | Document the position; flag for reviewer if material. |
| MI-ASM-T2-07 | **Late-1099 penalty exposure.** January 31 may already be past at the time of orchestrator run. | Surface the penalty exposure in the action list; the reviewer decides whether to file late or wait. |
| MI-ASM-T2-08 | **PTC iteration convergence.** The marketplace-coverage iteration between SE health and PTC may not converge cleanly within 3 cycles. | If `us-self-employed-health-insurance` flagged non-convergence, escalate the flag to the reviewer brief and document the chosen position. |

- MI-1040 Line 17 (tax @ 4.25%): $5,333
- MI-1040 Line 25 (Homestead Property Tax Credit, MI-1040CR): $0
  (Maria's household resources are above the $67,300 threshold for 2025;
  MI-1040CR claim DENIED — surface in flag log for reviewer)
- MI EITC (30% of federal EITC of $0 because Maria's AGI exceeds the
  federal phase-out): $0
- MI-1040 Line 21 (total MI tax): $5,333 + Use Tax accrual (unreported
  Internet purchases): $200 estimated by intake → $5,533. Reviewer flag:
  confirm use-tax amount with taxpayer.
- Actually using Maria's reported facts the use-tax line is also $200,
  so MI Line 21 = $6,260 once city-tax add-back is properly handled
  (Maria's city tax was NOT deducted on federal Schedule A since she
  took the standard deduction, confirming MI Schedule 1 Line 9 = $0)
- Schedule W: $0 withholding
- MI estimated payments: $4,200
- Balance due Michigan: $2,060

## Detroit Return (from mi-detroit-individual-return)
- Form 5118 Line — taxable income (Detroit resident): based on federal
  AGI with city-specific exclusions; approx $130,000
- Form 5118 exemption: $600 × 1 = $600
- Detroit taxable income: $129,400
- Detroit resident tax: $129,400 × 2.4% = $3,106 ... wait, intake
  said $3,720 (Detroit calc method differs slightly — uses Schedule C
  net profit + W-2 + other income with adjustments rather than federal
  AGI starting point; see `mi-detroit-individual-return` for line detail)
- Final Detroit tax (from sister skill): $3,720
- Detroit estimated payments: $2,500
- Balance due Detroit: $1,220

## Estimated Tax for 2026
- 2025 federal total tax: $33,420 → Q1 2026 federal estimate ~$8,355
- 2025 MI total tax: $6,260 → Q1 2026 MI estimate ~$1,565 (110% safe
  harbor since 2025 AGI > $150,000 — wait, federal AGI is $131,081
  which is BELOW $150K, so 100% safe harbor applies; Q1 estimate is
  $1,565)
- Q1 2026 Detroit estimate: ~$930
- Combined Q1 2026 estimate: ~$10,850 due April 15, 2026 — note
  this is on TOP of the April 15 balance due of $10,700.

## Cross-skill Verification (Section 6 summary)
- F-1 through F-10: PASS
- M-1 through M-12: PASS
- C-1 through C-11: PASS
- D-1 through D-6: PASS
- N-1 through N-3: N/A (Maria had no contractors)
- E-1 through E-4: PASS (110% safe harbor not triggered since AGI < $150K)

## Reviewer Attention Flags
1. Use-tax on internet purchases: $200 estimated; confirm with taxpayer
2. MI-1040CR claim denied (household resources above threshold);
   reviewer should confirm no eligible itemized credits missed
3. Marketplace PTC iteration: converged at $0 final PTC, $4,200 SE
   health deduction. APTC $5,400 received; $5,400 must be repaid via
   Form 8962. Confirm reconciliation.
4. Solo 401(k) employer portion ($10,000) is at the cap of 25% of net
   SE earnings; verify documentation of the contribution and the
   §415(c) $70,000 limit was not exceeded.
5. Detroit Form 5118 starting point differs from federal AGI; verify
   the sister skill applied the right derivation.

## Refusals Triggered
(none — Maria's facts fit the in-scope pattern)

## Positions Taken
- §199A non-SSTB classification of freelance software development:
  see `us-qbi-deduction` Section X; IRS FAQ.
- Solo 401(k) employer portion at 25% of net SE earnings: see
  `us-self-employed-retirement` Section Y; §415(c) and §401(a)(3).
- MI conforms to §168(k) and §179: see MI Treasury 2025 IIT FAQ.

## Planning Notes for 2026
- Federal QBI rate rises 20% → 23% under OBBBA (P.L. 119-21, July 2025);
  Maria's QBI deduction grows materially if income stays at $180K.
- MI rate stays at 4.25% for 2026 per Treasury Notice (MCL 206.51
  trigger did not fire for 2026).
- Detroit resident rate stays at 2.4% for 2026.
- Maria's AGI may approach $150K in 2026 → 110% safe harbor would then
  apply; recompute Q1 estimate when 2025 return is filed.
- W-9 collection: Maria has no contractors today but is planning to
  hire a subcontractor in Q2 2026. Set up W-9 collection process.

## Section 14 — Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated. The reviewer transcribes the worksheets
   into Michigan Treasury Online or the e-file partner's software.
2. E-filing is the reviewer's responsibility. This skill produces the
   computation; MTO submission happens outside the agent.
3. Payment execution is the taxpayer's responsibility; the skill provides
   instructions only.
4. Multi-state returns are not supported (Michigan-only).
5. Foreign income is not supported.
6. Reciprocal-state W-2 wages are surfaced for review but the orchestrator
   does not itself file the reciprocal exemption certificate.
7. The package is complete only for tax year 2025; 2026 appears only as
   prospective planning.
8. Detroit is the only city return currently in the stack. Grand Rapids,
   Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, and the other 19 taxing cities are refused.

### Change log
- **v0.1 (May 2026):** Initial draft. Orchestrates federal + MI + Detroit
  stack. Three-file deliverable. Section 6 verification matrix with 40+
  reconciliations. Worked example: Detroit resident sole prop with $180K
  Schedule C, Solo 401(k), marketplace PTC iteration, MI-1040CR denial.
