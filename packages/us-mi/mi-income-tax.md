## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rate — 2026 tax year

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Michigan flat income tax rate | 4.25% | MCL 206.51 |

Michigan uses a flat rate — the same 4.25% applies to all taxable income regardless of filing status or income level.

### Exemptions — 2026

| Item | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal exemption | $5,800 per person | MCL 206.30 |
| Stillbirth exemption | $5,800 | MCL 206.30 |
| Special exemption (disabled/deaf/blind) | $3,400 | MCL 206.30 |
| Disabled veteran exemption | $500 | MCL 206.30 |

Michigan does NOT have a state-level standard deduction for most filers. Taxpayers under age 67 deduct only personal exemptions from AGI.

### Retirement / senior deductions (age 67+)

| Filing status | Deduction |
|---|---|
| Single (age 67+) | $20,000 against all income |
| MFJ (both 67+) | $40,000 against all income |

### Key thresholds

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Filing deadline | April 15, 2027 (for TY 2026) |
| Extension | Automatic 6-month with federal extension |
| Estimated tax threshold | $500 expected liability after credits and withholding |
| Estimated payment due dates | April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 |

### City income taxes (overview)

24 Michigan cities impose a separate city income tax. The most notable:

| City | Resident rate | Non-resident / worker rate |
|---|---|---|
| Detroit | 2.4% | 1.2% |
| Grand Rapids | 1.5% | 0.75% |
| All other cities | 1.0% | 0.5% |

City income tax is filed on a separate return directly with the city. It is NOT computed on Form MI-1040.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Michigan taxable income begins with **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Additions** — Add back items Michigan does not exclude (e.g., deductions for income taxed by a Michigan city, interest on non-Michigan state/municipal bonds).
2. **Subtractions** — Subtract items Michigan excludes (e.g., U.S. government bond interest, Social Security benefits, Michigan state/local income tax refunds included in federal AGI, retirement/pension income for qualifying seniors).
3. **Michigan AGI** — Federal AGI + additions − subtractions.
4. **Personal exemptions** — $5,800 per qualifying exemption (2026).
5. **Michigan taxable income** — Michigan AGI − exemptions.
6. **Tax** — Michigan taxable income × 4.25%.
7. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits.

Michigan does NOT have a state standard deduction or itemized deductions for taxpayers under age 67.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** flows through federal Schedule C → federal AGI → Michigan AGI. No separate Michigan schedule for self-employment income.
2. **Federal SE tax deduction** — The 50% self-employment tax deduction is reflected in federal AGI. Michigan starts from federal AGI, so this carries through.
3. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments (Form MI-1040ES) if expected liability exceeds $500. Penalty applies for underpayment.
4. **Business equipment depreciation** — Michigan generally conforms to federal depreciation, including IRC § 179. Michigan also conforms to bonus depreciation under IRC § 168(k).
5. **Home office deduction** — Flows through federal Schedule C; no separate Michigan adjustment.
6. **Health insurance deduction** — The self-employed health insurance deduction is included in federal AGI. No Michigan add-back required.
7. **City income tax** — If the taxpayer operates a business in a city with a city income tax (e.g., Detroit), a separate city income tax return may be required.
