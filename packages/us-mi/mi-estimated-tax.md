## Section 3: Threshold determination — when MUST you make estimates

Under **MCL 206.301(1)**, an individual must make quarterly estimated payments
if the **expected annual Michigan tax liability**, after subtracting:

1. Michigan income tax withholding under MCL 206.351, AND
2. All allowable Michigan credits

**exceeds $500**.

### Decision flow

```
Step 1: Compute expected Michigan AGI for TY 2026.
Step 2: Compute Michigan tax at 4.25% (after personal exemptions of $5,800/each).
Step 3: Subtract anticipated Michigan withholding (from W-2 Box 17, 1099 boxes, pension W-4P).
Step 4: Subtract anticipated credits (Homestead Property Tax Credit, Home Heating Credit, etc.).
Step 5: If remainder > $500 → MUST make estimates.
        If remainder ≤ $500 → no estimates required (but voluntary payments allowed).
```

### Common triggers

| Situation | Trigger? |
|---|---|
| Sole prop / SMLLC with no withholding | Almost always YES once net SE income > ~$13,000 |
| W-2 earner with W-4 set correctly | Usually NO |
| W-2 earner with side gig (Schedule C) | Depends — compute step 5 |
| Retiree with no MI withholding on 1099-R | Yes if subtraction does not zero out tax |
| Capital gains windfall in current year | Yes — may also need annualized method (§7) |
| Both spouses earn — MFJ | Compute on combined liability |

`[VERIFY:]` MCL 206.301 uses the singular "person" — joint filers compute the
threshold on the combined liability shown on the joint MI-1040. Confirm with
2026 MI-1040ES instructions.

---

## Section 4: Safe-harbor calculation

A taxpayer who meets **any one** of the following safe harbors avoids the
underpayment penalty under MCL 205.24, regardless of the final balance due
on the MI-1040:

### Safe harbor 1 — Current-year 90%

Pay (through withholding + estimates) at least **90%** of the actual TY 2026
Michigan tax liability.

### Safe harbor 2 — Prior-year 100%

Pay at least **100%** of the TY 2025 Michigan tax shown on the MI-1040, line
20 (total tax), provided:

- The TY 2025 return covered **12 full months**, AND
- A TY 2025 MI-1040 was actually filed.

### Safe harbor 3 — High-income prior-year 110%

If TY 2025 federal AGI exceeded **$150,000** ($75,000 if MFS), the prior-year
safe harbor is **110%** of TY 2025 Michigan tax — not 100%.

`[VERIFY:]` Michigan's MI-1040ES 2026 instructions reference the federal
§6654(d)(1)(C) higher-income test. The MI safe harbor is presented as
"100% (or 110% if AGI > $150k)" by Michigan Treasury and by the official
MI-1040ES instructions. Confirm that the AGI threshold language continues
to apply at $150,000 for TY 2026 — the figure has not been indexed and
mirrors the federal threshold under §6654(d)(1)(C).

### Safe harbor 4 — Farmers, fishermen, seafarers (MCL 206.301(4))

If at least two-thirds of expected AGI is from farming, fishing, or
seafaring, taxpayer may pay:

- **66⅔%** of current-year tax in a single installment by **January 15**, OR
- File and pay full balance by **March 1** of the following year.

### Lower-of test

The taxpayer pays the **lower** of (a) the prior-year safe harbor and (b)
90% of current-year. Most software defaults to the prior-year amount
because it is fixed and certain. Use current-year 90% only if current-year
income has dropped materially.

---

## Section 5: Regular installment method — four equal payments

Under **MCL 206.301(2)**, each installment equals **one-quarter (¼)** of the
estimated annual tax (after expected withholding).

### Formula

```
Required annual payment (RAP) = lower of:
   (a) 90% × TY 2026 expected Michigan tax
   (b) 100% (or 110% if high-income) × TY 2025 Michigan tax
   (c) — for farmers/fishermen — 66⅔% × TY 2026 expected tax

Quarterly installment = (RAP − expected TY 2026 withholding) ÷ 4
```

### Timing table — TY 2026

| Installment | Period covered | Due date | Cumulative % required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31, 2026 | April 15, 2026 | 25% |
| Q2 | Apr 1 – May 31, 2026 | June 15, 2026 | 50% |
| Q3 | Jun 1 – Aug 31, 2026 | September 15, 2026 | 75% |
| Q4 | Sep 1 – Dec 31, 2026 | January 15, 2027 | 100% |

If a due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Michigan legal holiday, the
deadline shifts to the next business day (MCL 205.27a).

### Withholding rule

Michigan, like federal, treats withholding as paid **evenly across the four
quarters** unless the taxpayer elects to treat it as paid when actually
withheld. This is favorable to taxpayers whose withholding is back-loaded
(e.g., a December bonus with full MI withholding can cover earlier
underpayments).

---

## Section 6: Annualized income method (uneven income)

For taxpayers whose income arrives unevenly across the year — typical
patterns include consulting engagements that close in Q3, capital gains
realized in Q4, or seasonal businesses — Michigan permits an annualized
income installment method analogous to federal Form 2210 Schedule AI.

The method is implemented on **Form MI-2210, Part 3 (Annualized Income
Worksheet)**.

### Annualization periods

| Period | Months covered | Annualization factor |
|---|---|---|
| Period 1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 | × 4 |
| Period 2 | Jan 1 – May 31 | × 2.4 |
| Period 3 | Jan 1 – Aug 31 | × 1.5 |
| Period 4 | Jan 1 – Dec 31 | × 1 |

### Mechanics

1. Compute Michigan AGI for each cumulative period (YTD through Mar 31, May
   31, Aug 31, Dec 31).
2. Multiply by the annualization factor for that period to get annualized
   AGI.
3. Subtract pro-rated exemptions and apply 4.25%.
4. Multiply the annualized tax by the cumulative safe-harbor percentage
   (22.5%, 45%, 67.5%, 90% for the four periods — these are 90% × 25%/50%/
   75%/100%).
5. Subtract withholding allocated to that period and prior installments paid.
6. Result = required installment for that quarter.

### Worked snippet

A consultant with TY 2026 income heavily weighted to Q3:

| Period | YTD MI AGI | Annualized AGI | Annualized tax (4.25%) | Cum. required (× factor) | Prior installments | This installment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (Mar 31) | $8,000 | $32,000 | $1,360 | $306 (22.5%) | 0 | $306 |
| 2 (May 31) | $15,000 | $36,000 | $1,530 | $689 (45%) | $306 | $383 |
| 3 (Aug 31) | $90,000 | $135,000 | $5,738 | $3,873 (67.5%) | $689 | $3,184 |
| 4 (Dec 31) | $140,000 | $140,000 | $5,950 | $5,355 (90%) | $3,873 | $1,482 |

Without annualization the consultant would owe $1,488 per quarter
(roughly $5,950 ÷ 4). With annualization the Q1 and Q2 payments are tiny
because little income had been earned. Total paid across all four quarters
is identical, but no underpayment penalty accrues for Q1 and Q2.

## Section 7: Form MI-1040ES voucher — line by line

The 2026 MI-1040ES is a four-voucher set. Each voucher is identical except
for the period and due date.

| Voucher line | Field | What to enter |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Taxpayer's SSN | Primary filer SSN |
| 2 | Spouse SSN (if joint) | Spouse SSN |
| 3 | Filer's name and address | Primary + spouse names; mailing address |
| 4 | Voucher number (1, 2, 3, 4) | Pre-printed; matches quarter |
| 5 | Amount of estimated tax payment | $ amount in whole dollars |
| 6 | Make check payable to | "State of Michigan" — write filer SSN and "2026 MI-1040ES" on memo line |

### Mail-in destination

Michigan Department of Treasury
P.O. Box 30774
Lansing, MI 48909

### Joint vs separate filers (MCL 206.311)

- Joint filers may file a **single** MI-1040ES voucher set covering both
  spouses, OR each spouse may file separately.
- If a joint MI-1040 will be filed, joint estimates are easiest — credits
  apply to the combined liability.
- If one spouse later files MFS, the estimates can be allocated by mutual
  agreement (default allocation per MCL 206.311(2) is by proportion of each
  spouse's separate tax to the combined tax).

---

## Section 8: Underpayment penalty — Form MI-2210

When required estimates are not paid (or are paid late or short), MI-2210
calculates:

1. **Underpayment penalty** — a fixed percentage charge, AND
2. **Interest** — at the quarterly Treasury rate.

### Penalty component (MCL 205.24)

| Failure | Rate | Minimum |
|---|---|---|
| Failure to pay enough estimate / paid late | 10% of the underpayment | $10 per quarter |
| Failure to file an estimate at all | 25% of the underpayment | $25 per quarter |

### Interest component (MCL 205.23(2))

Interest accrues on each quarterly underpayment from the due date of that
installment to the **earlier of** (a) the date the underpayment was paid,
or (b) April 15 of the following year (the MI-1040 filing deadline).

The annual rate is set twice a year by Treasury under MCL 205.23(2) at
**1 percentage point above the adjusted prime rate** charged by three large
Michigan commercial banks.

| Period | Annual rate | Daily rate | Authority |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jan 1 – Jun 30, 2026 | 8.48% | 0.0002324 | RAB 2026-1 |
| Jul 1 – Dec 31, 2026 | 7.85% | 0.0002150 | RAB 2026-5 |

`[VERIFY:]` Rates for 2027 will be issued in RAB 2026-13 (December 2026)
and RAB 2027-5 (June 2027). Check michigan.gov/taxes/interest-rate before
finalizing any MI-2210.

### MI-2210 form structure

| Part | Function |
|---|---|
| Part 1 | Required Annual Payment (lower of 90% current / 100% (or 110%) prior) |
| Part 2 | Short Method (regular installments — equal quarterly amounts) |
| Part 3 | Annualized Income Worksheet (for uneven income; see §6) |
| Part 4 | Penalty and Interest Computation (per quarter) |

### Penalty waiver / reasonable cause

Under **MCL 205.24(4)** the Treasury may waive the underpayment penalty
(but not interest) for:

- Casualty, disaster, or other unusual circumstance where imposition would
  be inequitable;
- Reasonable cause shown — e.g., reliance on incorrect written advice from
  Treasury, retirement after age 62, or first-year self-employment;
- Death of the taxpayer during the year.

Submit a written reasonable-cause statement with MI-2210. Interest is
**not** waivable.

---

## Section 9: Payment methods

### MTO (Michigan Treasury Online) — preferred

1. Navigate to https://mto.treasury.michigan.gov/.
2. Sign in (or create an Individual account using SSN + prior-year AGI).
3. Select "Make a Payment" → "Estimated Tax (MI-1040ES)".
4. Choose tax year 2026 and the installment quarter (1–4).
5. Enter bank routing + account number for ACH eCheck (no fee), OR enter
   debit/credit card details.
6. Confirm — keep the MTO confirmation number for the file.

### Mail with voucher

Detach the appropriate quarterly voucher from MI-1040ES, attach check
payable to "State of Michigan", write SSN and "2026 MI-1040ES Q[n]" on
memo line, mail to P.O. Box 30774, Lansing, MI 48909. Use certified mail
for evidence of timely filing.

### Bank ACH debit (recurring)

Through MTO a taxpayer can schedule all four quarterly debits in advance
on the four statutory due dates. This is the recommended method for
sole-prop clients who want to "set and forget".

### Card fees

- Debit card: $3.95 flat fee per transaction.
- Credit card: 2.3% of payment (paid to processor, not Treasury).

## Section 10: Coordination with federal Form 1040-ES

Michigan due dates **match** federal due dates exactly:

| Quarter | Federal 1040-ES | Michigan MI-1040ES |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2026 | April 15, 2026 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2026 | June 15, 2026 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2026 | September 15, 2026 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2027 | January 15, 2027 |

### Practical workflow

1. Compute federal Schedule C net profit + SE tax under the
   `us-schedule-c-and-se-computation` skill.
2. Run federal estimated tax via `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` skill (1040-ES).
3. Apply the **federal AGI** figure as the input to the Michigan threshold
   test (§3) and the MI 4.25% computation (Michigan AGI starts from federal
   AGI — see `mi-income-tax` skill).
4. Compute MI required annual payment and divide by 4.
5. Schedule both federal and Michigan payments on MTO + EFTPS in the same
   session each quarter.

### Differences to watch

| Federal | Michigan |
|---|---|
| 25/25/25/25 installments | 25/25/25/25 installments (identical) |
| §6654 safe harbor 100%/110% | MCL 206.301 safe harbor 100%/110% (parallel) |
| §6654 interest rate (federal short-term + 3) | MCL 205.23 (prime + 1, set semi-annually) |
| Form 2210 | Form MI-2210 |
| EFTPS / IRS Direct Pay | Michigan Treasury Online (MTO) |
| Form 1040-ES voucher | Form MI-1040ES voucher |

## Section 11: Tier 1 deterministic rules + Tier 2 judgment rules

### Tier 1 — deterministic (do not require judgment)

| ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| T1-01 | Threshold = $500 expected liability after withholding and credits (MCL 206.301(1)) |
| T1-02 | Four installments due April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 |
| T1-03 | Each installment = ¼ of required annual payment (RAP) less expected withholding ÷ 4 |
| T1-04 | RAP = lower of (a) 90% current year or (b) 100% (110% if AGI > $150k) prior year |
| T1-05 | Farmer/fisherman alternative = 66⅔% by Jan 15 OR full payment by Mar 1 (MCL 206.301(4)) |
| T1-06 | Late/under penalty = 10% of shortfall, $10 min per quarter |
| T1-07 | Failure to file estimate = 25% penalty, $25 min per quarter |
| T1-08 | Interest rate = Treasury-set semi-annual rate under MCL 205.23 |
| T1-09 | Joint filers may file one voucher set (MCL 206.311) |
| T1-10 | Make check payable to "State of Michigan" with SSN + "2026 MI-1040ES Q[n]" on memo |

### Tier 2 — judgment-required (flag for reviewer)

| ID | Situation | Judgment call |
|---|---|---|
| T2-01 | High-income 110% trigger | Use TY 2025 federal AGI; if > $150k, default to 110% |
| T2-02 | Uneven income — use annualized method? | Use if Q1/Q2 income < 25% of annual; document |
| T2-03 | First-year self-employed (no prior-year liability) | Only current-year 90% safe harbor available; consider reasonable-cause waiver |
| T2-04 | Mid-year change in withholding | Recompute Q3/Q4; do not amend Q1/Q2 |
| T2-05 | Capital gains windfall Q4 | Annualized method usually beats regular installment |
| T2-06 | Spouse files MFS after joint estimates paid | Allocate per MCL 206.311(2) proportional rule |
| T2-07 | Detroit / Grand Rapids resident with city tax | City has separate estimated tax — do not combine |
| T2-08 | Reasonable-cause waiver request | Draft written statement; cite specific MCL 205.24(4) ground |

## Section 12: Worked examples

### Example 1 — Steady-income sole proprietor ($120k expected)

**Facts.** Single filer; full-year Michigan resident; sole proprietor with
expected TY 2026 Schedule C net profit of $120,000; no W-2 withholding;
TY 2025 MI-1040 total tax was $4,750 (federal AGI $115k); no city income tax.

**Step 1 — Determine if estimates required.**
- Expected MI AGI ≈ $120,000 − ½ SE tax adjustment ($8,478) = $111,522.
- Less personal exemption $5,800 → MI taxable $105,722.
- MI tax @ 4.25% = $4,493.
- No withholding, no credits → expected liability $4,493 > $500. **Estimates required.**

**Step 2 — Required annual payment (RAP).**
- Current-year 90%: $4,493 × 90% = $4,044.
- Prior-year 100%: $4,750. (Federal AGI was $115k, under $150k, so 100% applies.)
- RAP = lower = **$4,044**.

**Step 3 — Quarterly installment.**
- $4,044 ÷ 4 = **$1,011 per quarter**.

**Step 4 — Voucher schedule.**

| Quarter | Due date | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2026 | $1,011 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2026 | $1,011 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2026 | $1,011 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2027 | $1,011 |
| **Total** | | **$4,044** |

Schedule four ACH debits via MTO at sign-up; no further action required.

---

### Example 2 — Sole prop with Q3 income spike (annualized method)

**Facts.** Single filer; consultant; total 2026 net profit $140,000 but
landed in this distribution: $8,000 by Mar 31; $15,000 by May 31;
$90,000 by Aug 31; $140,000 by Dec 31. TY 2025 prior tax was $3,200.

**Regular installment method would require** $140,000 × ~4% MI = ~$5,950
annual tax × 90% ÷ 4 = **$1,339/quarter** — but the taxpayer earned only
$8,000 by Mar 31, so $1,339 due April 15 is roughly 67% of all income
earned to that date. Painful.

**Annualized method (MI-2210 Part 3):**

| Period | YTD MI AGI | × Factor | Annualized | × 4.25% | Cum. 22.5/45/67.5/90% | Less prior pmts | This pmt |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 (3/31) | $8,000 | 4.00 | $32,000 | $1,360 | $306 | 0 | $306 |
| 2 (5/31) | $15,000 | 2.40 | $36,000 | $1,530 | $689 | $306 | $383 |
| 3 (8/31) | $90,000 | 1.50 | $135,000 | $5,738 | $3,873 | $689 | $3,184 |
| 4 (12/31) | $140,000 | 1.00 | $140,000 | $5,950 | $5,355 | $3,873 | $1,482 |
| **Total** | | | | | | | **$5,355** |

The annualized method front-loads cash to Q3 when the income actually
arrived. No MI-2210 penalty accrues because each cumulative payment meets
the cumulative safe-harbor percentage.

`[VERIFY:]` Annualization factors mirror federal Schedule AI; confirm
the MI-2210 (2026 revision) replicates the federal 4 / 2.4 / 1.5 / 1
sequence.

### Example 3 — High-income W-2 earner with withholding shortfall

**Facts.** MFJ; both spouses W-2; combined wages $300,000; combined federal
AGI 2025 was $285,000 (i.e., > $150k threshold); MI withholding for 2026
projected at $9,500 against expected MI tax of $12,400; TY 2025 MI total
tax was $11,800. No self-employment income.

**Step 1 — Estimates required?**
- Expected MI tax $12,400 − withholding $9,500 = $2,900 shortfall.
- $2,900 > $500 → **Estimates required.**

**Step 2 — RAP under high-income rule.**
- Current-year 90%: $12,400 × 90% = $11,160.
- Prior-year 110% (because 2025 AGI > $150,000): $11,800 × 110% = $12,980.
- RAP = lower = **$11,160**.

**Step 3 — Subtract withholding spread evenly.**
- Required payments net of withholding: $11,160 − $9,500 = $1,660.
- Quarterly installment: $1,660 ÷ 4 = **$415 per quarter**.

**Step 4 — Voucher schedule.**

| Quarter | Due date | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15, 2026 | $415 |
| Q2 | June 15, 2026 | $415 |
| Q3 | September 15, 2026 | $415 |
| Q4 | January 15, 2027 | $415 |
| **Total estimates** | | **$1,660** |
| **+ Withholding** | | **$9,500** |
| **= RAP** | | **$11,160** |

**Step 5 — Alternative: increase W-4 withholding.**

For W-2 couples, increasing Michigan withholding via MI-W4 line 6
("additional amount per pay") is usually administratively easier than
quarterly vouchers — and withholding is treated as paid evenly across all
four quarters even if added in November, which can fully cure an
underpayment for Q1–Q3.
