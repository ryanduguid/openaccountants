## Section 2: Quick reference — the three tiers and the PA 4 phase-in

### 2.1 The three legacy tiers (post-PA 38 of 2011)

Public Act 38 of 2011 ("Snyder pension tax") replaced Michigan's pre-2012 unlimited
public-pension subtraction with a three-tiered system that conditions the
subtraction on the **older of taxpayer or spouse's year of birth** (the
"key person" for joint filers). The tier boundaries are codified at MCL
206.30(1)(f), (9), and (10) and have not moved with PA 4 of 2023 — what PA 4
of 2023 changed is what each tier may **claim**, not the birth-year boundaries.

| Tier | Birth year of older spouse | Legacy (pre-PA 4) rule |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Born **before** 1946 | Full subtraction of all public retirement benefits; private retirement benefits subtracted up to the inflation-indexed cap (the "Tier 1 cap"). |
| Tier 2 | Born **1 Jan 1946 – 31 Dec 1952** | At age 67: choose **either** the standard $20,000/$40,000 all-income deduction **or** Section B retirement subtraction under the Tier 2 caps. |
| Tier 3 | Born **1 Jan 1953 or later** | Under the legacy rule, no retirement subtraction except Social Security; at age 67, the $20,000/$40,000 all-income standard deduction (Tier 3 Michigan Standard Deduction). |

### 2.2 What PA 4 of 2023 changed

PA 4 of 2023 (the Lowering MI Costs Plan) was signed by Governor Whitmer on
March 7, 2023 and took effect February 13, 2024. It did **not** repeal the
three-tier statute; it added a **parallel phased subtraction** at MCL
206.30(9)(c)–(d) that progressively allows Tier 2 and Tier 3 taxpayers
(and any Tier 1 taxpayer choosing it) to claim **a percentage of the
pre-2012 Tier 1 cap** in lieu of the legacy tier-specific cap or the
all-income standard deduction. The phase-in is **birth-cohort gated** — a
taxpayer is only "in the door" for a given percentage if their birth year
falls within the cohort enabled for that tax year.

### 2.3 Phase-in percentages, eligible cohorts, and dollar caps

| Tax year | Phase-in % | Eligible birth cohort (in addition to pre-1946) | Indexed Tier 1 base cap (single / MFJ) | Phased cap = base × % (single / MFJ) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | 25% | 1946 – 1958 | $56,961 / $113,922 | $14,240 / $28,481 |
| 2024 | 50% | 1946 – 1962 | $64,040 / $128,080 | $32,020 / $64,040 |
| 2025 | 75% | 1946 – 1966 | $65,897 / $131,794 | $49,423 / $98,846 |
| 2026 | 100% | All retirees (1946+) | $67,610 / $135,220 | $67,610 / $135,220 |

Source for 2025: 2025 Form 4884 instructions, Worksheet 3.3 line 1
($65,897 / $131,794) and line 4 ("Multiply line 3 by 75% (0.75)").
Source for 2026: Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2026-1; the 2025 base of
$65,897 indexed forward for inflation produces $67,610 single / $135,220
MFJ. **[VERIFY:** the 2026 base cap of $67,610 / $135,220 was reported in
the Treasury's RAB 2026-1 summary; the published RAB PDF should be
re-fetched at the time of TY-2026 filing to confirm the indexed figure
before any 2026 return is signed.**]**

### 2.4 The all-income Michigan Standard Deduction at age 67+

Independent of the pension subtraction, MCL 206.30(9)(a) provides a
**Michigan Standard Deduction against all income** (not just retirement
income) for the older spouse who has reached age 67. PA 4 of 2023 did
**not** alter the dollar value of this deduction — it remains:

| Filing status | Michigan Standard Deduction (all-income) — 2025 & 2026 |
|---|---|
| Single / MFS (age 67+) | $20,000 |
| MFJ (older spouse age 67+) | $40,000 |
| Additional add-on if **either** spouse received SSA-exempt retirement (Schedule 1 box 24C) | + $15,000 |
| Additional add-on if **both** spouses received SSA-exempt retirement (boxes 24C **and** 24G) | + $30,000 |

Source: 2025 Form 4884 instructions, Worksheet 2 (lines for $20,000/$40,000
and the box 24C/24G add-ons); MCL 206.30(9)(a).

For TY 2026 through TY 2028, **Public Act 24 of 2025** removes the
requirement that Tier 3 taxpayers reduce their $20,000/$40,000 Michigan
Standard Deduction by the amount of Social Security benefits separately
deducted on Schedule 1, line 14. This is a Tier-3-only fix; the offset
remains in place for Tier 2. **[VERIFY:** the precise scope of the PA 24 of
2025 offset relief — whether it also waives the offset for railroad
retirement and military pay, or only Social Security — should be
re-confirmed against the published RAB 2026-1 before relying on it for a
Tier 3 return.**]**

### 2.5 Social Security, military, railroad — always fully exempt

Regardless of tier, regardless of phase-in year, the following are
**fully subtracted from Michigan AGI on Schedule 1, line 11** (not on
Form 4884) and are **fully exempt from Michigan income tax**:

- Social Security benefits (taxable portion included in federal AGI)
- Railroad retirement benefits (Tier 1 and Tier 2 RRTA benefits)
- Retirement income from service in the U.S. Armed Forces
- Retirement income from the Michigan National Guard

However — and this is the trap — when those amounts are also reported on
Schedule 1, line 11, they **reduce the cap available on Form 4884** for
private retirement benefits (see Worksheets 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 line 2 / line
10). The exempt amount is "used up" against the same cap that private
pension income would consume.

---

## Section 3: The PA 4 of 2023 phase-in narrative

### 3.1 What was repealed and what wasn't

PA 4 of 2023 is universally described as "repealing the Snyder pension
tax," but legally it did **not** repeal MCL 206.30(9)–(10) — those
subsections (the three-tier framework) remain in the statute. What PA 4
did was add MCL 206.30(1)(f)(ii) — a **new alternative subtraction**
that, when fully phased in, mirrors the pre-2012 Tier 1 cap for every
retiree born in or after 1946. A Tier 2 or Tier 3 taxpayer who would
benefit from the old rules can still elect them; in practice, the new
phased subtraction is more generous for nearly all retirees with
material pension income.

### 3.2 Year by year — what's available

**Tax year 2023.** Phase-in opens at **25%** of the 2023 Tier 1 indexed
cap ($14,240 single / $28,481 MFJ). Eligible cohort = born **1946
through 1958**. Tier 3 taxpayers born after 1958 receive nothing under
the new subtraction in 2023 and remain on the legacy regime (no
retirement subtraction unless age 67 reached, in which case the
$20,000/$40,000 Michigan Standard Deduction applies).

**Tax year 2024.** Phase-in advances to **50%** ($32,020 single /
$64,040 MFJ). Eligible cohort expands to **1946 through 1962**.

**Tax year 2025.** Phase-in advances to **75%** ($49,423 single /
$98,846 MFJ — Form 4884 Worksheet 3.3 line 4). Eligible cohort expands
to **1946 through 1966**. This is the figure on the **2025** Form 4884.

**Tax year 2026.** Phase-in reaches **100%** — the full Tier 1 cap of
$67,610 single / $135,220 MFJ is available to **every retiree born in
or after 1946**, regardless of cohort. The phase-in is complete. From
2026 onward, the only meaningful birth-year distinction remaining is
the unlimited public-pension subtraction reserved to Tier 1 (born
before 1946) — and even that is functionally moot, because by TY 2026
the youngest Tier 1 taxpayer is 81 years old and the cohort is shrinking.

### 3.3 Why the structure matters even after 2026

Three reasons the tiers continue to matter even at full restoration:

1. **Public vs. private retirement income still differs for Tier 1.**
   A Tier 1 taxpayer with $200,000 of public Michigan state pension
   income subtracts the entire $200,000 (because public pensions for
   pre-1946 retirees are unlimited under MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i)) and may
   still claim private retirement subtraction up to the cap, **but
   only to the extent the cap is not already exhausted by public
   pension income** (Worksheet 3.1 / 3.2 lines 3–7; the form deducts
   public benefits from the cap before measuring private benefits).
2. **The all-income $20,000/$40,000 standard deduction at age 67+ is
   still on the menu** as an alternative to the phased pension
   subtraction. For a Tier 2 or Tier 3 taxpayer with **substantial
   non-retirement income** (e.g., Schedule C self-employment, large
   investment income), the all-income deduction may be more valuable
   than even the 100% phased pension subtraction. The taxpayer must
   compute both and "claim the most beneficial" (Form 4884
   questionnaire, page 22 of instructions, footnote †).
3. **The Tier 3 Social-Security-offset relief under PA 24 of 2025**
   is **only available for Tier 3 (born after 1952) and only for TY
   2026 through TY 2028**. Tier 2 taxpayers using the $20,000/$40,000
   standard deduction must still offset by Social Security benefits
   separately deducted on Schedule 1 line 14.

## Section 4: Tier 1 deterministic rules

| Rule ID | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| MI-PEN-T1-01 | Begin with federal AGI from federal Form 1040, line 11. Form 4884 reports a **subtraction** that flows to Schedule 1 (MI-1040) line 27. | MCL 206.30(1)(f) |
| MI-PEN-T1-02 | "Key person" for joint filers = older of taxpayer or spouse. The tier is determined by the key person's year of birth (instructions, Q3 of "Which Section Should I Complete"). | 4884 Instr. p. 22 |
| MI-PEN-T1-03 | Social Security, railroad retirement, U.S. Armed Forces retirement, and Michigan National Guard retirement are **always fully subtracted** on Schedule 1 line 11, regardless of tier. Do **not** include them on Form 4884 line 8. | 4884 Instr. p. 20 |
| MI-PEN-T1-04 | The Form 4884 cap (Worksheet 3.1/3.2/3.3 line 1) is **$65,897 single / $131,794 MFJ** for tax year 2025. For TY 2026 the indexed cap is $67,610 / $135,220 (per RAB 2026-1). | 4884 Worksheet 3.1–3.3 |
| MI-PEN-T1-05 | The cap on Form 4884 line 1 of each worksheet must be reduced by military / National Guard / railroad retirement subtractions claimed on Schedule 1 line 11. This is **Worksheet 3.1 line 2**, **Worksheet 3.2 line 2**, **Worksheet 3.3 line 2**. | 4884 Worksheet 3.1–3.3 |
| MI-PEN-T1-06 | **Tier 1 (born before 1946):** complete **Section A** of Form 4884. Subtract **all** public Michigan and federal retirement benefits, plus private benefits up to the cap remaining after public benefits are absorbed (Worksheet 3.1 logic: cap minus public benefits, then take the smaller of remainder or private benefits). | MCL 206.30(1)(f)(i); 4884 Instr. p. 19 |
| MI-PEN-T1-07 | **Tier 2 (born 1946 – 1952):** Choose **most beneficial of** (i) Section B Form 4884 pension subtraction (Worksheet 3.1), (ii) Section D phased subtraction (Worksheet 3.3, 75% in 2025), or (iii) Worksheet 2 all-income $20,000/$40,000 Michigan Standard Deduction if age 67+. | MCL 206.30(9); 4884 Instr. p. 22 questionnaire |
| MI-PEN-T1-08 | **Tier 3 (born 1953 – 1958):** Choose **most beneficial of** (i) Section D phased subtraction (Worksheet 3.3, 75% in 2025), or (ii) Worksheet 2 $20,000/$40,000 standard deduction if age 67+. There is **no Tier 3 Section B legacy retirement subtraction** unless the taxpayer is in SSA-exempt employment. | MCL 206.30(1)(f); 4884 Instr. p. 21 |
| MI-PEN-T1-09 | **Tier 3 (born 1959 – 1966):** Same as MI-PEN-T1-08 — use Worksheet 3.3 (Section D) for 2025. The cohort expansion is what newly admits 1963–1966 birth years to the phased subtraction in TY 2025. | 4884 Instr. p. 20 |
| MI-PEN-T1-10 | **Born after 1966 (TY 2025):** Generally **no retirement subtraction** is available except the Social Security / military / railroad exemption on Schedule 1 line 11. In TY 2026 this cohort becomes fully eligible for the 100% phased subtraction. | 4884 Instr. p. 21 |
| MI-PEN-T1-11 | **SSA-exempt employment recipients born 1 Jan 1959 – 1 Jan 1964 who have reached age 62:** May subtract up to $15,000 / $30,000 (MFJ both qualifying) via **Section C, Worksheet 3.2**. | 4884 Instr. p. 20–21; line 18 |
| MI-PEN-T1-12 | **SSA-exempt retirees born after 1 Jan 1959 retired as of 1 Jan 2013:** May subtract up to $35,000 single / $55,000 MFJ / $70,000 MFJ both qualifying via **Section B, Worksheet 3.1**. | 4884 Instr. p. 20; line 17 |
| MI-PEN-T1-13 | **Qualified Fire, Police, and County Corrections retiree** (and surviving spouse of one): may elect **unlimited** subtraction of all public retirement benefits from qualified service, plus private retirement subtraction up to cap — Section A regardless of birth year. Check Form 4884 line 6a. | MCL 206.30(11); 4884 Instr. p. 19 |
| MI-PEN-T1-14 | Roth IRA distributions are **not** included in federal AGI; therefore there is nothing to subtract and they do **not** appear on Form 4884 line 8. | 4884 Instr. p. 19 — only AGI-included benefits |
| MI-PEN-T1-15 | 401(k) / 403(b) distributions attributable to **unmatched** employee contributions, 457 plans, and Thrift Savings Plan distributions are **excluded** from qualifying retirement benefits. Do not list on Form 4884 line 8. | 4884 Instr. p. 19 |
| MI-PEN-T1-16 | Rollovers preserve the character of the original plan. A rollover from a qualifying public pension into an IRA is still "public" for purposes of Section A. | 4884 Instr. p. 19 |
| MI-PEN-T1-17 | Distributions taken **before the plan's stated retirement age** (e.g., separation-from-service distributions taken before age 55/59½ unless they qualify as Section 72(t)(2)(A)(iv) substantially-equal-periodic-payment) are **not** qualifying retirement benefits. Do not list on Form 4884 line 8. | 4884 Instr. p. 19 |
| MI-PEN-T1-18 | Surviving spouse rules: the survivor may use the **older of decedent's or surviving spouse's** year of birth to determine tier, **provided** the survivor (a) claimed a retirement or Social Security subtraction on the joint return filed in the year the spouse died and (b) has not remarried. Otherwise the survivor's own birth year governs. | 4884 Instr. p. 20 |
| MI-PEN-T1-19 | The Section A/B/C/D subtraction flows to **Schedule 1 (MI-1040) line 27**, **not** line 25 (additions) or line 11 (other subtractions). Schedule 1 line 11 is where Social Security / military / railroad are subtracted. | 4884 Instr. p. 21 (each section); Schedule 1 |
| MI-PEN-T1-20 | The 4.25% Michigan flat rate (MCL 206.51) applies after the subtraction is netted from federal AGI. There is no graduated effect, but the subtraction directly lowers Michigan taxable income dollar-for-dollar. | MCL 206.51 |

## Section 5: Tier 2 judgment rules

These rules require professional judgment. Each row carries a "flag for
review" indicator — the model **may compute** the result but the
human verifier **must sign off** before filing.

| Rule ID | Situation | Judgment required |
|---|---|---|
| MI-PEN-T2-01 | **Choose the most beneficial subtraction.** Form 4884 page 22 questionnaire instructs taxpayers in many cohorts to "complete Worksheet 2 and Worksheet 3.3 and claim the most beneficial subtraction." This is **not deterministic** — it requires computing both and comparing the resulting Michigan taxable income. | Compute both branches and apply the larger subtraction. Note that the "most beneficial" may be either (i) the phased pension subtraction or (ii) the all-income standard deduction depending on the mix of pension vs. non-pension income. **Flag for verifier confirmation**. |
| MI-PEN-T2-02 | **Tier 3 election: PA 4 phased subtraction vs. all-income standard deduction.** A 1955-born retiree age 70 in TY 2025 with $30,000 of pension and $25,000 of Schedule C income should consider that the $20,000 standard deduction reduces **all income** including the Schedule C, whereas the $49,423 Section D phased subtraction reduces **only pension income** (capped at the actual $30,000 of pension). The Section D path may still win because $30,000 > $20,000, but the analysis is fact-pattern-driven. | Compute both. Where pension < $20k single / $40k MFJ, the all-income deduction may win. Where pension > cap, Section D usually wins. **Flag for verifier confirmation**. |
| MI-PEN-T2-03 | **Pre-Snyder grandfathered pensions for Tier 3 taxpayers.** A 1955-born taxpayer who was already retired from a **qualifying public source** as of 1 January 2013 may, under certain conditions, retain the pre-Snyder treatment. The 2025 Form 4884 instructions handle this through the **SSA-exempt-employment-retired-as-of-1-Jan-2013** carve-out on line 17 (Section B, Worksheet 3.1) — but this is only for SSA-exempt employment (state/local government employees not covered by Social Security). | The grandfather rule does **not** restore pre-Snyder treatment for taxpayers covered by Social Security. **Confirm the taxpayer's SSA-exempt status with their employer or pension administrator** (typically state and local government employers in Michigan that opted out of Social Security). |
| MI-PEN-T2-04 | **Surviving spouse using decedent's year of birth.** If the decedent was Tier 1 (born before 1946) and the survivor is Tier 3 (born after 1952), the survivor can use Tier 1 treatment **only if** (a) the survivor claimed a retirement subtraction on the final joint return in the year of death and (b) has not remarried. Documentation of the prior return is mandatory. | Review the prior-year MI-1040 jointly filed with the decedent. If the decedent died in a year prior to the introduction of PA 4 of 2023, verify the subtraction was actually claimed. **Hold for verifier review**. |
| MI-PEN-T2-05 | **Rollover treatment.** A rollover from a qualified public pension into an IRA is still "public" for Form 4884 purposes (rule MI-PEN-T1-16), but if the IRA is subsequently rolled into a 401(k), the character may be murky — particularly if the new 401(k) is at a non-Michigan employer. | If the chain of rollovers is non-trivial, **flag for verifier review** and obtain the original 1099-R distribution codes and the plan documents establishing the public-source origin. |
| MI-PEN-T2-06 | **Part-year residency.** Form 4884 line 8F instructs part-year residents to use only the Michigan-source portion from Schedule NR line 10 column B. The subtraction is therefore limited proportionally. | Part-year residency is **out of scope** for this skill (mi-income-tax MI-R-01 refusal applies). |
| MI-PEN-T2-07 | **Spouses with different birth years and one deceased.** Joint return with surviving spouse born 1962 and pre-2025-deceased spouse born 1944 — survivor may elect to use decedent's year of birth (Tier 1) **only if** the conditions of MI-PEN-T2-04 are met.

## Section 6: Worked examples

> All examples assume tax year **2025** unless otherwise noted, Michigan
> resident the entire year, and a 4.25% flat rate. All dollar figures are
> calculation-stage, before personal exemptions and credits.

### 6.1 Example A — Tier 1 retiree, $60k pension + Social Security

**Facts.** Eleanor, single, born 1942 (age 83 in 2025), full-year
Michigan resident. 2025 income:

- Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System (MPSERS) pension: $60,000
- Social Security benefits: $28,000 (federally taxable portion: $23,800)
- Interest income: $4,000

Federal AGI = $60,000 + $23,800 + $4,000 = **$87,800**.

**Step 1 — Schedule 1 line 11 subtractions.** Subtract $23,800 of Social
Security from Michigan AGI.

**Step 2 — Tier determination.** Eleanor was born before 1946 → **Tier 1**
→ complete **Section A** of Form 4884 (Instr. p. 19).

**Step 3 — Worksheet 3.1 (Section B logic applied through Section A).**
The 2025 cap is $65,897 single. Eleanor's MPSERS pension is a Michigan
public source. Under Tier 1, public benefits are **unlimited** up to the
cap; she has no private pension here, so the full $60,000 is subtracted.

| Line | Amount |
|---|---|
| Worksheet 3.1 line 1 (cap, single) | $65,897 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 2 (military/NG/railroad) | $0 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 3 (public benefits) | $60,000 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 4 (sum 2+3) | $60,000 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 5 (cap − line 4) | $5,897 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 6 (private benefits) | $0 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 7 (smaller of 5 or 6) | $0 |
| Worksheet 3.1 line 8 (3 + 7) | $60,000 |

**Step 4 — Form 4884 line 16 (Section A total).** $60,000.

**Step 5 — Schedule 1.** Line 11 = $23,800 (Social Security); Line 27 =
$60,000 (Form 4884).

**Michigan AGI** = $87,800 − $23,800 − $60,000 = **$4,000** (only the
interest income remains taxable). After personal exemption ($5,800), Eleanor
has **$0 Michigan taxable income** and zero Michigan tax.

### 6.2 Example B — Tier 2 retiree, mixed pension and 401(k)

**Facts.** Frank and Helen, married filing jointly. Frank is the older
spouse, born 1948 (age 77 in 2025) → Tier 2. Helen born 1951. Both
retired. 2025 income:

- Frank's General Motors private pension (non-Michigan public source): $42,000
- Frank's traditional IRA distribution: $18,000
- Helen's 401(k) distribution (matched employer contributions only): $24,000
- Social Security (Frank + Helen, taxable portion): $30,000
- U.S. Treasury bond interest (subtracted separately): $3,000

Federal AGI = $42,000 + $18,000 + $24,000 + $30,000 + $3,000 = **$117,000**.

**Step 1 — Schedule 1 subtractions before Form 4884.** Subtract $30,000
Social Security and $3,000 U.S. Treasury interest on Schedule 1 line 11.

**Step 2 — Tier determination.** Older spouse born 1948 → **Tier 2** →
"Did the key person reach age 67? Yes → complete Worksheet 2 and Worksheet
3.3 and claim the most beneficial" (4884 Instr. p. 22, Q6 path).

**Step 3a — Worksheet 3.3 (Section D phased subtraction).**

| Line | Amount |
|---|---|
| Line 1 (cap, MFJ) | $131,794 |
| Line 2 (military/NG/railroad) | $0 |
| Line 3 (line 1 − line 2) | $131,794 |
| Line 4 (75% × line 3) | $98,846 |
| Line 5 (total retirement on line 8 — Frank's pension + IRA + Helen's 401(k)) | $84,000 |
| Line 6 (smaller of 4 or 5) | $84,000 |

**Section D subtraction = $84,000.** All three retirement amounts are
qualifying private benefits (Frank's GM pension is not a Michigan public
source; IRA distributions after 59½ qualify; matched-contribution 401(k)
qualifies).

**Step 3b — Worksheet 2 (all-income Michigan Standard Deduction).**
MFJ, both spouses 67+ → $40,000 standard deduction. Less Social Security
offset of $30,000 (Tier 2 must offset under MCL 206.30(9), and PA 24 of
2025 relief does **not** apply to Tier 2) → **net standard deduction =
$10,000**. **[VERIFY:** the precise mechanics of the Social Security offset
calculation in Worksheet 2 for TY 2025 should be re-confirmed line-by-line
before filing.**]**

**Step 4 — Choose most beneficial.** $84,000 (Section D) >> $10,000
(Worksheet 2). **Use Section D**, enter $84,000 on Form 4884 line 19 →
Schedule 1 line 27.

**Step 5 — Michigan AGI.** $117,000 − $30,000 − $3,000 − $84,000 =
**$0**. No Michigan tax.

### 6.3 Example C — Tier 3 retiree, PA 4 phased restoration vs. legacy

**Facts.** Mark, single, born 1956 (age 69 in 2025) → Tier 3. Retired
2018 from a private employer. Not in SSA-exempt employment. Not a
qualified public safety officer. 2025 income:

- Traditional IRA distribution: $55,000
- Private pension from former employer (matched 401(k) annuity): $20,000
- Social Security: $26,000 (federally taxable portion: $22,100)
- Schedule C self-employment net profit (part-time consulting): $35,000

Federal AGI = $55,000 + $20,000 + $22,100 + $35,000 = **$132,100**.

**Step 1 — Schedule 1 line 11.** Subtract $22,100 Social Security.

**Step 2 — Tier determination.** Born 1956, age 69 in 2025. "Did key
person reach age 67? Yes → complete Worksheet 2 and Worksheet 3.3 and
claim the most beneficial" (4884 Instr. p. 22, Q6 path). No
SSA-exempt-employment carve-out (so Worksheet 3.1 / 3.2 do not apply).

**Step 3a — Worksheet 3.3 (Section D phased subtraction).**

| Line | Amount |
|---|---|
| Line 1 (cap, single) | $65,897 |
| Line 2 (military/NG/railroad) | $0 |
| Line 3 (1 − 2) | $65,897 |
| Line 4 (75% × line 3) | $49,423 |
| Line 5 (total retirement = IRA + private pension) | $75,000 |
| Line 6 (smaller of 4 or 5) | $49,423 |

**Section D subtraction = $49,423.**

**Step 3b — Worksheet 2 (all-income Michigan Standard Deduction).**
Single, age 67+ → $20,000 standard deduction.
- Less Social Security offset: For Tier 3, **PA 24 of 2025 (effective TY
  2026–2028) removes the Social Security offset against the standard
  deduction**. In **2025**, however, the offset still applies — so the
  $22,100 Social Security must reduce the $20,000 deduction → **net
  Worksheet 2 = $0**. **[VERIFY:** confirm whether PA 24 of 2025's
  effective-date language reaches back into TY 2025 or only begins at TY
  2026. The most likely reading is TY 2026 onward, in which case TY 2025
  Tier 3 returns still face the offset. RAB 2026-1 should clarify on
  publication.**]**

**Step 4 — Choose most beneficial.** $49,423 (Section D) > $0 (Worksheet 2). Use Section D. Enter $49,423 on Form 4884 line 19 → Schedule 1 line 27.

**Step 5 — Michigan AGI.** $132,100 − $22,100 − $49,423 = **$60,577**.
Less personal exemption ($5,800) = $54,777 taxable. Tax at 4.25% =
**$2,328**.

**TY 2026 contrast.** Same facts in TY 2026 with full 100% restoration
(cap $67,610 single):

- Section D subtraction = min($67,610, $75,000) = **$67,610**.
- Worksheet 2 = $20,000 standard deduction with **no Social Security
  offset under PA 24 of 2025** (Tier 3 only, TY 2026–2028) = **$20,000**.
- Section D still wins: $67,610 > $20,000.
- Michigan AGI = $132,100 − $22,100 − $67,610 = **$42,390**.
  Tax at 4.25% (assuming rate unchanged) = roughly $1,557 — a roughly
  **$770 tax saving** versus 2025 from the phase-in moving from 75% to
  100%.

This is exactly the dynamic the Lowering MI Costs Plan was designed to
produce: a meaningful per-retiree tax cut in 2026 relative to 2025, on
top of the recent reductions for the same household in 2023 and 2024.

## Section 7: Form 4884 mapping

### 7.1 Form 4884 structure

Form 4884 has **four mutually exclusive computational sections** plus a
header (lines 1–8). A taxpayer completes **exactly one** of Section A,
Section B, Section C, or Section D based on the Form 4884 page-22
questionnaire and rules MI-PEN-T1-06 through MI-PEN-T1-13.

| Section | Carry-to line on Form 4884 | Worksheet | Who uses it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Section A | Line 16 | (logic embedded in Section A; mirrors Worksheet 3.1 structure for public/private cap interaction) | Tier 1 (born pre-1946); Qualified Fire/Police/County Corrections retirees electing MCL 206.30(11) |
| Section B | Line 17 | Worksheet 3.1 | Tier 2 retirement subtraction; SSA-exempt-retired-1/1/2013 (born after 1959) |
| Section C | Line 18 | Worksheet 3.2 | SSA-exempt-employment-recipient born 1 Jan 1959 – 1 Jan 1964 reached age 62 |
| Section D | Line 19 | Worksheet 3.3 | PA 4 of 2023 phased subtraction — Tier 2 and Tier 3 eligible cohort |

### 7.2 Form 4884 line-by-line (TY 2025)

| Line | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1–3 | Name, SSN | Both SSNs for MFS; do not enter spouse's name on MFS |
| 4, 5 | Year of birth for each spouse | Do not enter spouse year on MFS |
| 6a | Box: Qualified Fire/Police/County Corrections retiree | Triggers MCL 206.30(11) unlimited public pension election |
| 6b | Box: Born after 1/1/1959 AND retired 1/1/2013 from SSA-exempt employment | Triggers Section B Worksheet 3.1 path with elevated $35k/$55k/$70k caps |
| 7a–7d | Deceased spouse info (if claiming based on decedent's year of birth) | Decedent must have died **prior to** current tax year |
| 8 | Retirement benefits listing — up to 8 entries (continuation Form 4973 for >8) | Columns: payer FEIN, distribution code, taxable amount; **column 8B** flags decedent-attributable; **column 8F** is the taxable amount included in federal AGI |
| 9–15 | Section A (Tier 1 / public safety) computation | Cap subject to military/railroad offset on line 10; line 16 carries to Schedule 1 line 27 |
| 16 | **Section A total** → **Schedule 1 line 27** | Do not complete B/C/D |
| 17 | **Section B total** → **Schedule 1 line 27** | From Worksheet 3.1 line 12 |
| 18 | **Section C total** → **Schedule 1 line 27** | From Worksheet 3.2 line 10 |
| 19 | **Section D total** → **Schedule 1 line 27** | From Worksheet 3.3 line 6 |

### 7.3 Schedule 1 (MI-1040) interaction

| Schedule 1 line | Item | Relationship to Form 4884 |
|---|---|---|
| Line 11 | Income from U.S. govt bonds, military/NG retirement, railroad retirement, Social Security | **Subtracted separately**, but **reduces** the Form 4884 cap (Worksheets 3.1/3.2/3.3 line 2) |
| Line 14 | Other subtractions (incl. Social Security details) | Tier 2/3 box 24C/24G add $15k/$30k to Form 4884 Worksheet 3.1 line 10 |
| Line 27 | Retirement benefits subtraction from Form 4884 | Carries from line 16, 17, 18, **or** 19 (whichever section completed) |

### 7.4 Worksheet 2 (all-income Michigan Standard Deduction)

Worksheet 2 is **not** Form 4884 — it is filed on Schedule 1 directly (the
$20,000 / $40,000 deduction is a Schedule 1 entry, not a Form 4884
subtraction). It is referenced from the Form 4884 questionnaire only as
the alternative to be compared against on the "most beneficial" rule.

| Status | Worksheet 2 baseline | Offset by Schedule 1 line 11 items |
|---|---|---|
| Single 67+ | $20,000 | Yes (military/NG, railroad, Social Security — except PA 24 of 2025 Tier 3 relief TY 2026–2028) |
| MFJ both 67+ | $40,000 | Yes (same offsets) |
| MFJ one 67+, one not | $20,000 (older spouse only) | Yes |

## Section 8: Refusal catalogue

| ID | Situation | Action |
|---|---|---|
| MI-PEN-R-01 | Part-year or non-resident return | **Refuse** — outside Form 4884 simplification scope; see mi-income-tax MI-R-01 |
| MI-PEN-R-02 | Multi-state pension (taxpayer worked for non-Michigan public employer covered by another state's reciprocal pension subtraction rule) | **Refuse** — requires reciprocity analysis under MCL 206.30(1)(f) "public benefits from other states that offer a similar or reciprocal subtraction or exemption for Michigan public benefits" — fact-pattern and other-state-statute review required |
| MI-PEN-R-03 | Tier 4-style question — pension received as separation pay before retirement age | **Refuse** — 4884 Instr. p. 19 excludes pre-retirement separation distributions, but borderline cases (e.g., disability retirement before 55) require plan-document review |
| MI-PEN-R-04 | Surviving spouse claim where prior joint return is not available | **Refuse** — survivor election turns on whether prior-year subtraction was actually claimed; without the prior return, election is unsupported |
| MI-PEN-R-05 | Qualified Fire/Police/County Corrections election where service mix is unclear (e.g., partial Michigan service, partial out-of-state) | **Refuse** — MCL 206.30(11) requires service under 1969 PA 312, 1980 PA 17, or county sheriff facility; out-of-state service does not qualify unless "substantially similar federal employment"; flag for verifier |
| MI-PEN-R-06 | Roth conversions in retirement — taxable portion treatment on Form 4884 | **Refuse** — taxable Roth conversion amounts are included in federal AGI; whether they qualify on Form 4884 line 8 turns on the source plan (matched 401(k) → IRA → Roth conversion likely qualifies; unmatched 401(k) → IRA → Roth conversion likely does not). Requires source-plan analysis |
| MI-PEN-R-07 | Inherited IRA distributions where decedent was Tier 1 but beneficiary is Tier 3 and not the surviving spouse | **Refuse** — non-spousal inherited IRA falls outside the "qualifying surviving spouse" rule; beneficiary uses own birth year; flag for verifier |
| MI-PEN-R-08 | TY other than 2025 or 2026 | **Refuse** — caps and phase-in percentages change annually; use the year-specific Form 4884 instructions |
| MI-PEN-R-09 | Michigan city income tax on retirement benefits | **Refuse** — most Michigan cities (Detroit, Grand Rapids, etc.) **exclude** retirement income from city tax base, but each city's rules differ. Out of scope; refer to mi-income-tax MI-R-03 |
| MI-PEN-R-10 | Mid-year change in residency where retirement payments straddle | **Refuse** — Schedule NR analysis required; out of scope |
| MI-PEN-R-11 | Public Act 24 of 2025 fact patterns where the Social Security offset interaction with the standard deduction is dispositive | **Computational caution** — RAB 2026-1 must be confirmed against the actual published text before relying on the Tier 3 offset relief; flag with [VERIFY:] for human verifier |
| MI-PEN-R-12 | Distributions from Michigan-source pension to non-resident — Michigan source-rule analysis | **Refuse** — non-resident return out of scope |

## Section 9: Provenance

### 9.1 Primary statutory and form authorities

1. **MCL 206.30(1)(f)** — The general retirement subtraction language, including
   the public/private distinction and the phased restoration language added by
   PA 4 of 2023. The (1)(f)(i) clause is the legacy Tier 1 rule; (1)(f)(ii) is
   the PA 4 phased restoration.
2. **MCL 206.30(9)** — The Michigan Standard Deduction at age 67+
   ($20,000 / $40,000), the box 24C/24G SSA-exempt add-ons, and the offset
   mechanics. PA 24 of 2025 amended subsection (9) to remove the offset for
   Tier 3 taxpayers for TY 2026–2028.
3. **MCL 206.30(10)** — Definitional cross-references for retirement-benefit
   types (qualifying private vs. public, surviving-spouse rules).
4. **MCL 206.30(11)** — Qualified Fire/Police/County Corrections officer
   unlimited-election clause, added by PA 4 of 2023.
5. **PA 4 of 2023** (Lowering MI Costs Plan) — Signed 7 March 2023; effective
   13 February 2024. Established the four-year phase-in (25% → 50% → 75% →
   100%) and the public-safety-officer election.
6. **PA 24 of 2025** — Signed 7 October 2025. Amended MCL 206.30(9) to remove
   the Social Security offset against the Tier 3 Michigan Standard Deduction
   for TY 2026 through TY 2028.
7. **Form 4884 (TY 2025) and Instructions** — The official form and 30-page
   instructions package. The Worksheets 2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and the "Which
   Section of Form 4884 Should I Complete?" page-22 questionnaire are the
   operational core of this skill.
8. **Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2023-22** — Treasury's official
   interpretation of PA 4 of 2023, referenced from the 2025 Form 4884
   instructions (page 21).
9. **Revenue Administrative Bulletin 2026-1** — Treasury's published guidance
   on TY 2026 caps and the PA 24 of 2025 amendments. The TY 2026 cap of
   $67,610 / $135,220 used in this skill traces to this bulletin.

### 9.3 Verification notes

Items marked **[VERIFY:]** inline in Section 2.3, Section 2.4, Section 6.2,
and Section 6.3 require the human verifier to re-confirm against the
published RAB 2026-1 and the TY 2025 Form 4884 instructions (URLs above)
before any return is signed. Specifically:

- **The TY 2026 indexed cap of $67,610 / $135,220** — confirm from
  RAB 2026-1 published text once the PDF is released.
- **The PA 24 of 2025 effective date** — confirm whether the Tier 3 Social
  Security offset relief begins in TY 2025 (October 2025 effective date)
  or TY 2026 (most likely reading).
- **The scope of PA 24 of 2025** — confirm whether the offset relief
  applies only to Social Security or also to railroad / military / National
  Guard retirement offsets in Worksheet 2.
