# TX Franchise Tax

## What this file is

**Obligation category:** EF (Entity Fees) / IT (margin tax)
**Functional role:** Entity filing + Computation
**Status:** Complete

This is a Tier 2 content skill for computing and filing the Texas franchise tax for single-member LLCs. Texas has no personal income tax, but the franchise tax (also called the "margin tax") applies to most legal entities doing business in Texas, including SMLLCs. Sole proprietors without an LLC are NOT subject to franchise tax.

## Section 1 -- Scope statement

### No-tax-due threshold

- **No-tax-due threshold filing requirement** — For the 2026 report, an entity with annualized total revenue at or below $2,650,000 owes no franchise tax and is not required to file a No Tax Due Report. Form 05-163 is discontinued for report years 2024 and later. The entity generally must still file Form 05-102 Public Information Report or Form 05-167 Ownership Information Report, unless a specific exception such as a qualifying new veteran-owned business applies.  _([Texas Comptroller No Tax Due Reporting for Report Year 2024 and Later; 2026 Franchise Tax Report Forms](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/forms/2026-franchise.php))_

### Step 1: Determine if the entity is subject to franchise tax

0. **Step 1** — Is the entity an LLC, LP, LLP, corporation, or other legal entity? --> Subject. Is the entity a sole proprietorship (no LLC)? --> Exempt. STOP. Is the entity a general partnership owned entirely by natural persons? --> Exempt. STOP.

### Step 2: Determine total revenue

0. **Step 2** — Total revenue is computed from federal tax return data: For entities filing federal Form 1040 Schedule C (SMLLCs): total revenue = gross income from Schedule C plus all other revenue items attributable to the entity. Generally: total revenue = gross receipts minus returns and allowances, plus other income items per Texas Tax Code §171.1011.

### Step 3: Apply the no-tax-due threshold

0. **Step 3** — If annualized total revenue <= $2,650,000 for the 2026 report: do not file Form 05-163; it is discontinued. File the required PIR (Form 05-102) or OIR (Form 05-167), unless a specific exception applies. No franchise tax payment required. STOP computation here.  _([Texas Comptroller 2026 Franchise Tax Report Forms](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/forms/2026-franchise.php))_

### Step 4: Choose computation method

0. **Step 4** — If total revenue > $2,650,000, choose ONE of: **Option A: EZ Computation (if total revenue <= $20,000,000)** - Tax = apportioned total revenue x 0.331% - No deductions for COGS, compensation, or margin. - Simplest method but may result in higher tax. **Option B: Standard computation -- COGS method** - Taxable margin = total revenue - cost of goods sold - Tax = taxable margin x rate (0.375% retail/wholesale or 0.75% other) **Option C: Standard computation -- Compensation method** - Taxable margin = total revenue - compensation - Tax = taxable margin x rate **Option D: 70% of total revenue** - Taxable margin cannot exceed 70% of total revenue. - This is an automatic cap, not an election.

### Step 5: Compute apportionment (if multi-state)

0. **Step 5** — If the entity has revenue from both Texas and other states: Texas apportionment factor = Texas gross receipts / total gross receipts everywhere. Apply factor to taxable margin. For entities operating entirely in Texas: apportionment factor = 100%.

### Step 6: Compute tax due

0. **Step 6** — EZ method: apportioned revenue x 0.331%. Standard method: apportioned taxable margin x applicable rate (0.375% or 0.75%)

### Step 7: Compare computation methods

0. **Step 7** — For standard computation, the tax is the LESSER of: Tax computed using COGS method; Tax computed using compensation method; Tax computed using 70% of total revenue method

### Step 8: File required forms

0. **Step 8** — Regardless of tax due, file the required information report or tax report path: below-threshold entities generally file Form 05-102 PIR or Form 05-167 OIR only; above-threshold entities file E-Z Computation (05-169) or Long Form (05-158-A/B) plus PIR/OIR as applicable. Form 05-163 is discontinued for report years 2024 and later.  _([Texas Comptroller 2026 Franchise Tax Report Forms](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/forms/2026-franchise.php))_

### E-1: SMLLC is subject even though disregarded federally

- **SMLLC subject even though disregarded federally** — A single-member LLC that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes is treated as a separate taxable entity for Texas franchise tax purposes. The SMLLC must file its own franchise tax report using data from the owner's federal return (Schedule C).  _(Texas Tax Code §171.0002(a))_

### E-2: Passive entities

- **Passive entities** — A qualifying passive entity under Texas Tax Code §171.0003 does not file Form 05-163. For report years 2024 and later, it must file either the E-Z Computation Report or the Long Form, blacken the passive-entity circle, complete the accounting-year fields, sign the report, and generally need not file a PIR or OIR.  _([Texas Comptroller No Tax Due Reporting for Report Year 2024 and Later; 2026 Franchise Tax Report Forms](https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/franchise/ntd-rpt-updates-2024.php))_

### E-3: First-year reporting

- **First-year reporting** — A newly formed entity's first franchise tax report covers a short period (date of formation through the entity's first accounting year end). The no-tax-due threshold is NOT prorated for short periods.  _(unsure)_

### E-4: Retail vs. wholesale classification

- **Retail vs. wholesale classification** — Entities primarily engaged in retail or wholesale trade qualify for the reduced 0.375% rate. The entity must derive more than 50% of its total revenue from retail or wholesale activities. Misclassification is a common audit trigger.  _(Texas Tax Code §171.002(b))_

### E-5: COGS for service businesses

- **COGS for service businesses** — Service businesses generally cannot use the COGS method because they do not sell tangible personal property. However, Texas has a broad COGS definition that includes some service costs. Review Texas Tax Code §171.1012 carefully. When in doubt, use the compensation method.  _(Texas Tax Code §171.1012)_

### E-6: No tax due but must still file

- **No tax due but must still file** — Even if the entity owes $0 in franchise tax, the filing requirement remains. Failure to file results in forfeiture of the entity's right to transact business in Texas and potential involuntary termination.  _(unsure)_

### Test 1: Below no-tax-due threshold

**Input:** SMLLC with total revenue of $180,000.
**Expected:** Below $2,650,000 threshold. File Form 05-102 (or Form 05-167 if applicable); do not file Form 05-163. Tax: $0.

### Test 2: EZ computation

**Input:** SMLLC with total revenue of $3,000,000, 100% Texas.
**Expected:** EZ tax: $3,000,000 x 0.331% = $9,930. Compare with standard methods to choose optimal.

### Test 3: Standard computation -- compensation method

**Input:** Service SMLLC. Total revenue: $5,000,000. Compensation paid: $2,000,000. 100% Texas.
**Expected:** Margin: $5,000,000 - $2,000,000 = $3,000,000. Cap: 70% x $5,000,000 = $3,500,000. Use $3,000,000. Tax: $3,000,000 x 0.75% = $22,500.

### Test 4: Retail entity at reduced rate

**Input:** Retail SMLLC. Total revenue: $4,000,000. COGS: $2,500,000.
**Expected:** Margin: $1,500,000. Cap: $2,800,000. Use $1,500,000. Tax: $1,500,000 x 0.375% = $5,625.

### Test 5: Sole proprietor (no entity)

**Input:** Individual freelancer with no LLC.
**Expected:** NOT subject to TX franchise tax. No filing required.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- **P-1** — Do NOT tell a sole proprietor (without an LLC) that they must file franchise tax. They are exempt.  _(unsure)_
- **P-2** — Do NOT prorate the no-tax-due threshold for short-period returns.  _(unsure)_
- **P-3** — Do NOT use the COGS method for a service business without verifying that the costs qualify under §171.1012.  _(Texas Tax Code §171.1012)_
- **P-4** — Do NOT skip the Public Information Report (05-102). It is always required.  _(unsure)_
- **P-5** — Do NOT classify an entity as retail/wholesale for the reduced rate unless >50% of revenue is from retail/wholesale activities.  _(unsure)_
- **P-6** — Do NOT advise on whether to form or dissolve an LLC based on franchise tax implications. That is legal advice.  _(unsure)_
