## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Mississippi taxable income is computed independently from the federal return — Mississippi does NOT start from federal AGI. Instead:

1. **Report all income** — Wages, self-employment income, interest, dividends, capital gains, rental income, etc. are reported directly on Form 80-105 and supporting schedules.
2. **Adjustments** — Mississippi allows its own adjustments (e.g., deduction for 50% of self-employment tax, contributions to MS retirement plans).
3. **Deductions** — Apply the Mississippi standard deduction OR Mississippi itemized deductions.
4. **Personal exemptions** — Subtract personal exemptions ($6,000 single, $12,000 MFJ, etc.).
5. **Mississippi taxable income** — Gross income − adjustments − deductions − exemptions.
6. **Tax** — 0% on first $10,000; 4.4% on excess (TY 2025).
7. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits.

**Key difference:** Mississippi is a "separate computation" state. It does NOT piggyback on federal AGI or federal taxable income. The taxpayer must independently compute Mississippi income.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** — Report net business income on Form 80-105 directly. Mississippi recognizes the same business income and expenses as the federal return in most cases, but the starting point is gross income, not federal AGI.
2. **Self-employment tax deduction** — Mississippi allows a deduction for 50% of self-employment tax paid, mirroring the federal deduction.
3. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments if expected liability exceeds $200. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
4. **Business equipment depreciation** — Mississippi generally follows federal depreciation rules, including IRC § 179 expensing. Check conformity for bonus depreciation (IRC § 168(k)).
5. **Health insurance deduction** — Self-employed health insurance premiums are deductible for Mississippi purposes, consistent with the federal deduction.
6. **No local income tax** — Mississippi does not permit local income taxes.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| MS-T2-01 | **Residency determination** — Mississippi uses a domicile test. A person domiciled in Mississippi or spending 183+ days in the state is a resident. | If taxpayer has homes in multiple states, flag for professional review. |
| MS-T2-02 | **Separate computation** — Mississippi does not start from federal AGI. Verify that all income items are independently reported on Form 80-105. | Cross-check against federal return to ensure nothing is missed. |
| MS-T2-03 | **Itemized deductions** — Mississippi allows itemized deductions similar to federal Schedule A but with Mississippi-specific limits. | Compare MS itemized vs. standard deduction to choose the better option. |
| MS-T2-04 | **Credit for taxes paid to other states** — Available to prevent double taxation on income earned in other states. | Requires the other state's return. |
| MS-T2-05 | **Income tax phase-out** — Rate drops annually (4.4% → 4.0% → 3.75% → ...) with potential full elimination. Confirm the applicable rate for the tax year. | Check MSDOR for the current-year rate before filing. |
| MS-T2-06 | **Bonus depreciation conformity** — Mississippi's conformity to IRC § 168(k) should be verified for the tax year. | Compare MS conformity date to asset placed-in-service date. |
