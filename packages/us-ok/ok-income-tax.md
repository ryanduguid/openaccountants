## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Oklahoma starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** on federal Form 1040, Line 11. Oklahoma then applies its own modifications (additions and subtractions) to arrive at Oklahoma AGI, then subtracts the standard or itemized deduction and personal exemptions to arrive at Oklahoma taxable income.

**Key flow:**

1. Federal AGI → Oklahoma modifications → Oklahoma AGI
2. Oklahoma AGI − standard or itemized deduction − exemptions = Oklahoma taxable income
3. Apply graduated tax rates → Oklahoma tax before credits
4. Apply credits → Oklahoma income tax liability

### Oklahoma deduction rules

- If the taxpayer **did not** itemize on the federal return, they must use the Oklahoma standard deduction.
- If the taxpayer **did** itemize federally, they must use Oklahoma itemized deductions (which use federal Schedule A as a starting point with adjustments).
- Oklahoma itemized deductions are capped at $17,000, except for charitable contributions and medical expenses, which are not subject to the cap.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity

Oklahoma generally conforms to the IRC but with specific exceptions. Key items for self-employed:

- **Deductible half of SE tax** reduces federal AGI and flows through to Oklahoma.
- **QBI deduction (§199A):** The QBI deduction is below-the-line on federal Form 1040 and does not affect federal AGI. Oklahoma starts from federal AGI, so no QBI add-back is needed on the Oklahoma return.
- **§179 expensing:** Oklahoma generally conforms to the federal §179 limit. Verify Oklahoma's conformity with OBBBA changes to §179.
- **Bonus depreciation (§168(k)):** Verify Oklahoma's conformity with OBBBA restoration of 100% bonus depreciation. If Oklahoma does not conform, an adjustment may be needed.

### Oklahoma additions (common for self-employed)

- State/local income tax deducted on federal Schedule A (add back on Oklahoma return if itemizing)
- Interest from non-Oklahoma state/local bonds
- Deductions not allowed under Oklahoma law

### Oklahoma subtractions (common for self-employed)

- Federal income tax deduction: Oklahoma is one of the few states that allows a deduction for federal income tax paid, subject to a cap based on federal AGI (see Form 511, Schedule 511-D). Cap for 2025: the lesser of actual federal tax paid or the cap amount based on AGI.
- Military retirement pay exclusion (up to 100%)
- Social Security benefits (to the extent included in federal AGI — Oklahoma fully excludes Social Security)
- Retirement income exclusion (up to $10,000 per person for qualifying retirement income)

### Federal income tax deduction (unique to Oklahoma)

Oklahoma allows a deduction for federal income tax liability. This is unusual among states. The deduction is limited and calculated on Schedule 511-D. The cap is based on the taxpayer's federal AGI.

| Federal AGI | Approximate cap on federal tax deduction |
|---|---|
| Up to $54,670 | Various amounts (see Schedule 511-D table) |
| Over $54,670 | Federal AGI × 0.00056 |

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**R-OK-1. Federal AGI is the starting point.** Form 511, Line 1 = federal Form 1040, Line 11.

**R-OK-2. Social Security is fully exempt.** Subtract Social Security benefits included in federal AGI.

**R-OK-3. State income tax add-back required if itemizing.** If the taxpayer itemized on the federal return and deducted state income taxes, the state income tax deduction must be added back on the Oklahoma return.

**R-OK-4. Itemized deduction cap = $17,000.** Oklahoma caps itemized deductions at $17,000 (excluding charitable contributions and medical expenses). If federal itemized deductions (minus state tax add-back, plus adjustments) exceed $17,000, cap at $17,000 plus the exempt categories.

**R-OK-5. Federal income tax deduction is available.** Calculate using Schedule 511-D based on the taxpayer's federal AGI and actual federal tax liability.

**R-OK-6. Sales tax relief credit.** Low-income taxpayers may qualify for the sales tax relief credit (Form 538-S). The credit is based on income and the number of exemptions claimed.

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**J-OK-1. Federal tax deduction timing.** The federal income tax deduction is based on tax paid during the calendar year (not the liability for the year). This includes estimated payments, withholding, and any payments with extension. Judgment is needed to determine the correct amount.

**J-OK-2. Oklahoma conformity with OBBBA.** Verify whether Oklahoma has enacted specific conformity or decoupling legislation for OBBBA provisions. If not conformed, adjustments may be needed for bonus depreciation, §179, and other OBBBA items.

**J-OK-3. Residency determination for part-year situations.** Oklahoma defines a "resident" as one who is domiciled in Oklahoma or maintains a permanent place of abode and spends more than seven months of the year in Oklahoma.

| Form 511 line | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Line 1 | Federal AGI | Federal Form 1040, Line 11 |

## Section 9: Refusal catalogue

**REFUSE-OK-1.** REFUSE to prepare an Oklahoma return for a nonresident or part-year resident without the appropriate Schedule 511-NR. This skill covers full-year residents only.

**REFUSE-OK-2.** REFUSE to compute the federal income tax deduction without the complete payment history for the year. Estimated payments, withholding, and extension payments all factor in.

**REFUSE-OK-3.** REFUSE to determine Oklahoma conformity with specific OBBBA provisions without verifying the current Oklahoma conformity date and any enacted exceptions.

**REFUSE-OK-4.** REFUSE to claim the sales tax relief credit for a taxpayer without verifying income eligibility thresholds and filing requirements.
