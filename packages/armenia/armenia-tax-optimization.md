# Armenia Tax Optimization

## Armenia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: State Revenue Committee (SRC), PwC Armenia, Vardanyan & Partners, EasyTaxes. Figures must agree with `armenia-income-tax.md` / `armenia-social-contributions.md`. NOT yet signed off by an Armenian tax adviser. Aggressive positions are never advised; every suggestion must be reviewed.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Republic of Armenia |
| Currency | AMD (dram) |
| Headline levers | Turnover tax (single tax replacing CIT + VAT); micro-business 0%; general system 18% CIT |
| Dividends | **5%** withholding |
| Anti-avoidance | **Professional/advisory services EXCLUDED from the special regimes (from 1 Jul 2025)** |

> **The Armenian headline is the TURNOVER-TAX regime** — a single tax on revenue that replaces both profit tax and VAT for businesses under the threshold. **But beware:** from **1 July 2025** professional/advisory services (legal, accounting, consulting, IT-advisory, engineering, etc.) are **excluded** and must use the general system.

## Section 2 -- Turnover-Tax (simplified) Regime

**Turnover-Tax (simplified) Regime**

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Threshold | Annual sales **< AMD 115,000,000** (~USD 291k) |
| Replaces | Profit tax **and** VAT — a single tax on revenue |
| Trade rate | **10%** (raised from 5% in 2025); since 2025 you can deduct **9.5% of documented purchase costs**, with a **1%-of-turnover minimum** effective floor |
| Other activities | Different turnover-tax rates apply by activity. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the rate for the specific activity.]** |

## Section 3 -- Micro-Business (0%)

- **0% tax** for annual sales **< AMD 24,000,000** (~USD 61k), limited to specific activities (manufacturing, hospitality/accommodation, education, digital content creation, certain non-Yerevan retail, artisan work, etc.). (Vardanyan & Partners)

## Section 4 -- General System & Extraction

**General System & Extraction**

| Item | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Sole proprietor (PE) profit tax | 23% |
| LLC corporate tax | 18% |
| Dividends | 5% withholding |
| PIT (employment) | 20% flat (per `armenia-income-tax.md`) |

For an LLC: 18% CIT, then 5% on dividends → relatively low all-in extraction; retained profit is taxed at the corporate level.

## Section 5 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Professional/advisory services exclusion** — legal, accounting, audit, management consulting, market research, advertising, engineering, architectural, healthcare and similar advisory work cannot use the turnover-tax or micro-business regimes — they must operate under the general system (18% CIT + VAT). Misclassifying advisory work to claim the low regimes is a primary risk. AUDIT FLASH POINT.  _(from 1 Jul 2025)_
- **Genuine self-employment / substance requirement** — Genuine self-employment / substance required.
- **Mandatory health-insurance contribution from 2026** — Note the new mandatory health-insurance contribution from 2026 for higher earners (see `armenia-income-tax.md`) when modelling net position.  _(see `armenia-income-tax.md`)_

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER place professional/advisory-services income into the turnover-tax or micro-business regime (excluded from 1 Jul 2025).
- NEVER present the turnover tax as still 5% — the trade rate rose to 10% in 2025.
- NEVER ignore the AMD 115m / AMD 24m thresholds.
- NEVER contradict the rates in `armenia-income-tax.md` / `armenia-social-contributions.md`.
- NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Armenian tax adviser.
