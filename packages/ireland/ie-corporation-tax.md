## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 2.1 Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — Signed statutory financial statements (Companies Act 2014 format) for the accounting period; prior-year Form CT1; confirmation of (i) trading vs non-trading income split, (ii) close-company status, (iii) group structure, (iv) any Pillar Two scope flag.

**Recommended** — General ledger trial balance; fixed-asset register with capital allowance schedule (Section 284 wear-and-tear, Section 291A intangibles); R&D expenditure schedule with Section 766 categorisation; KDB tracking-and-tracing computation if claimed; preliminary tax payment confirmations; CRO B1 annual return confirmation (separate from CT but reviewer should cross-check).

**Ideal** — Audited statements with audit report and iXBRL-tagged file; transfer pricing local file (Section 835G TCA); CbCR (Section 891H TCA) if part of a group with consolidated revenue > €750M; Pillar Two GIR (Globe Information Return) workings; intercompany agreements; Revenue eBrief alerts subscription log; prior-year Revenue audit / intervention correspondence.

**HARD STOP if minimum is missing.** Without statutory accounts and the prior-year CT1, no CT computation may be produced.

### 2.2 Refusal Catalogue

**R-IE-CT-1 — Non-resident company with no Irish branch.** Section 23A residence test required first. Non-resident companies with no Irish PE / branch are outside Irish CT scope. Escalate to a cross-border specialist (see `_cross-border`).

**R-IE-CT-2 — Sector-specific regimes.** Banking and IFSC funds (Sections 110, 246), life assurance (Part 26 TCA), REITs (Section 705A et seq.), IREFs (Section 739K et seq.), petroleum (Part 24), mining (Part 24), Islamic finance (Part 8A) — out of scope.

**R-IE-CT-3 — Section 110 SPV bespoke computations.** Flagged at Tier 2 (see Section 5.3) but bespoke profit-participating loan structures, qualifying asset definitions, and Section 110(5A) restrictions require specialist sign-off. Do not produce a Section 110 computation without explicit reviewer engagement.

**R-IE-CT-4 — Pillar Two GIR preparation.** Skill flags scope and routes data; the **GloBE Information Return (GIR)** and the QDMTT return itself require specialist co-pilot software (e.g., OECD GIR XML schema). Out of scope for unaided generation.

**R-IE-CT-5 — Aggressive structuring.** Will not advise on debt-push-down, IP migration timing for KDB capture, residence migration to/from Ireland, hybrid mismatch structuring (anti-hybrid rules Sections 835AG–835AY), or principal-purpose-test (PPT) avoidance positions. Section 811C general anti-avoidance rule and protective notification regime under Section 811D applies — escalate.

**R-IE-CT-6 — Revenue intervention or audit.** Active audit, profile interview, level 1/2/3 intervention, or qualifying disclosure under Section 1077E TCA — do not draft positions without engaged CTA representation.

**R-IE-CT-7 — Cross-skill scope.** Personal tax → `ie-income-tax-form11`; USC → `ie-usc`; PRSI → `ie-prsi-class-s`; VAT → `ireland-vat-return`; preliminary income tax (individuals) → `ie-preliminary-tax`.

**R-IE-CT-8 — Functional currency election.** Section 402 TCA functional currency cases require a separate computation discipline and reviewer sign-off — do not auto-elect.

---

## Section 3 — Tier 1 Rules (Standard Computation)

### 3.1 The 12.5% Trading Rate — Section 21 TCA 1997

**Legislation:** Section 21(1) TCA 1997 sets the standard CT rate at **12.5%** on trading income (Case I and Case II of Schedule D where the company carries on a trade).

```
CT (trading) = 12.5% × Trading profits adjusted for tax
```

**"Trading" defined:** Section 3 TCA — a trade is "every trade, manufacture, adventure or concern in the nature of trade". The case law (Birmingham & District Cattle By-Products v IRC; CIR v Livingston) emphasises the badges of trade. Investment-holding income is **not** trading.

**Manufacturing / IP / services:** All bona-fide trading activity qualifies at 12.5% — there is no longer a separate manufacturing relief (abolished from 31 December 2010). Mere passive holding of assets does not qualify.

### 3.2 The 25% Non-Trading Rate — Section 21A TCA 1997

**Legislation:** Section 21A applies a **25%** CT rate to:

| Category | Schedule D Case | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Investment income (interest, dividends from non-Irish sources) | Case III | Foreign interest, foreign dividends (subject to exemption tests under Sections 21B / 626B) |
| Rental income from Irish or foreign property | Case V (Irish) / Case III (foreign) | Net rental profits |
| Royalties (where not part of a trade) | Case III / IV | Passive licensing receipts |
| Mining, petroleum, dealing in land | Case I (specified trades) | Petroleum (Part 24); dealing in land (Section 21A(2)) |
| Other Case IV / Case V income | Various | Miscellaneous untaxed income |

```
CT (non-trading) = 25% × Non-trading profits
```

**Total CT liability** = (12.5% × Case I/II trading profits) + (25% × Case III/IV/V non-trading profits) + (33% × chargeable gains, with adjustment via Section 78 to gross up to 33% effective).

### 3.3 Capital Gains — Section 28 TCA

Companies pay CT (not CGT) on chargeable gains, but the effective rate is **33%** (the CGT rate). Section 78 grosses up the gain by the formula `Gain × (33/12.5)` if computed at the 12.5% rate, or `Gain × (33/25)` at the 25% rate, so the effective tax is 33%.

**Substantial shareholding exemption — Section 626B TCA:** Disposal of shares in a qualifying subsidiary (≥ 5% held for ≥ 12 months in the past 5 years, trading subsidiary, EU/treaty country) is exempt from CT on the gain.

### 3.4 Pillar Two — 15% Effective Minimum Tax

**Legislation:** Part 4A TCA 1997 (inserted by **Finance (No. 2) Act 2023**, implementing **Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523** of 14 December 2022).

**Scope:** Multinational and large domestic groups with **consolidated revenue > €750M** in at least **2 of the 4 preceding financial years**. Excluded entities: government, international organisations, non-profits, pension funds, ultimate parent investment funds, real estate investment vehicles.

**Three rules — sequential application:**

1. **QDMTT (Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax)** — Ireland's domestic top-up applied first. Effective for fiscal years beginning **on or after 31 December 2023**. Calculated under Irish QDMTT computation rules aligned with the GloBE rules. Has QDMTT-safe-harbour status.
2. **IIR (Income Inclusion Rule)** — Parent-level top-up where a low-taxed constituent entity sits below an Irish-resident parent. Effective for fiscal years beginning **on or after 31 December 2023**.
3. **UTPR (Undertaxed Profits Rule)** — Backstop allocation rule for low-taxed entities not captured by IIR. Effective for fiscal years beginning **on or after 31 December 2024**.

**Effective tax rate (ETR) computation:** For each jurisdiction:
```
ETR = Adjusted Covered Taxes / GloBE Income
Top-up Tax % = max(0, 15% − ETR)
Top-up Tax = Top-up Tax % × Excess Profit
where Excess Profit = GloBE Income − Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE)
SBIE (transitional) = 9.8% payroll carve-out + 7.8% tangible-asset carve-out (2024), declining to 5% + 5% by 2033
```

**Filing:** Pillar Two top-up tax return ("Top-up Tax Information Return" / Irish equivalent) and the **GloBE Information Return (GIR)** filed via Revenue's Pillar Two portal. First GIR filings deadline: **30 June 2026** for FY 2024 (i.e., 18 months after FY-end for transition year; 15 months thereafter).

**Transitional CbCR safe harbour:** For FYs starting before 31 December 2026, jurisdictions passing the de minimis, simplified ETR, or routine profits test under qualified CbCR may avoid full GIR computation.

**Conservative default:** Pillar Two **out of scope** unless the in-scope test (€750M consolidated revenue, 2 of 4 years) is confirmed in writing with consolidated group accounts. Refuse to compute IIR / QDMTT / UTPR without specialist co-pilot software and a CTA in the loop (R-IE-CT-4).

### 3.5 Close-Company Surcharges — Sections 440, 441 TCA

**Definition (Section 430):** A "close company" is one under the control of 5 or fewer participators (or any number of director-participators).

**Section 440 surcharge:** 20% surcharge on undistributed investment and rental income (non-trading) that is not distributed within 18 months of the accounting period end.

**Section 441 surcharge:** 15% surcharge on 50% of undistributed professional service income for close service companies (e.g., dentists, solicitors operating through a company).

**De minimis relief — Section 434:** Surcharge does not apply if total undistributed income is less than €2,000 (Section 440) or a small threshold (Section 441).

**Conservative default:** Assume close-company status applies to any owner-managed company and check the dividend strategy against Section 440/441 exposure.

### 3.6 Capital Allowances — Section 284 et seq. TCA

| Asset class | Wear-and-tear rate | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Plant and machinery | 12.5% straight-line over 8 years | Section 284 TCA |
| Motor vehicles (CO2 categories A–C ≤ 155 g/km) | 12.5% on lower of cost / specified amount (€24,000 cap) | Section 380K |
| Motor vehicles (CO2 D–F) | Restricted / nil | Section 380K |
| Industrial buildings | 4% straight-line over 25 years (most categories) | Section 271–273 |
| Intangible assets (Section 291A specified intangibles) | Aligned with accounting amortisation OR 7% (15-year life) elected; capped at 80% of trading income (re-introduced from FA 2017) | Section 291A |
| Energy-efficient equipment | 100% accelerated allowance (Section 285A) — note: scheme ended for new claims after 31 December 2025 unless extended by FA |

**Section 291A cap:** Capital allowances and related interest on specified intangibles cannot reduce trading income by more than **80%** in any accounting period. Excess carries forward.

### 3.7 Trading Losses — Sections 396, 396A, 396B TCA

| Relief | Mechanism | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Current-year offset | Trading loss offset against other Case I / total profits of the same period | Section 396(1) |
| 1-year carry-back | Trading loss carried back 12 months against trading income of the prior period | Section 396A |
| Indefinite carry-forward | Trading loss carried forward against future trading income of the **same trade** | Section 396(1) |
| Value-basis offset | Trading losses surrendered on a "value basis" against tax on non-trading income (Section 396B) — converted at 12.5% / 25% ratio | Section 396B |
| Terminal loss relief | Final 12 months' trading loss against trading income of preceding 3 years | Section 397 |

**Restriction (Section 396C):** Pre-trading losses are restricted to the trade that gave rise to them. Same-trade continuity is required for carry-forward; cessation extinguishes the loss.

### 3.8 Group Relief — Sections 411–429 TCA

**Group definition (Section 411):** Two companies are in a 75% group where one is the 75% beneficial-ownership subsidiary of the other, or both are 75% subsidiaries of a third company. The parent must be EU- or EEA-resident or treaty-jurisdiction-resident for surrender of losses (post-Marks & Spencer ECJ and Section 420C extensions).

**What can be surrendered:** Current-year trading losses, excess capital allowances, excess management expenses, excess Case V losses, certain charges on income.

**Mechanism:** Loss-maker surrenders to claimant within the same group; claimant offsets against profits of the corresponding accounting period (or a corresponding portion if periods do not align). Payment for group relief can be made up to the surrendered amount and is tax-neutral.

**Consortium relief — Section 412:** Available where a company is owned 75%+ collectively by a consortium and each member holds 5%–75%.

### 3.9 Computation Template

| Step | Item |
|---|---|
| 1 | Profit per accounts (statutory accounts under Companies Act 2014 / IFRS / FRS 102) |
| 2 | Add back: non-deductible expenses (entertainment, fines, depreciation, accounting amortisation outside Section 291A) |
| 3 | Less: tax-deductible amounts not in accounts (capital allowances under Section 284, R&D under Section 766) |
| 4 | Separate income into Case I (trading), Case III (foreign investment), Case IV (other), Case V (Irish rents) |
| 5 | Apply 12.5% to Case I/II; apply 25% to Case III/IV/V; compute chargeable gains at 33% effective |
| 6 | Apply credits: R&D tax credit (Section 766), foreign tax credit (Schedule 24), KDB relief (Section 769I if elected) |
| 7 | Compute close-company surcharge (Sections 440/441) on undistributed income |
| 8 | Determine preliminary tax obligation and balance due on CT1 |

---

## Section 4 — Deductible and Non-Deductible Expenses

### 4.1 General Deductibility — Section 81 TCA (Schedule D Case I/II)

An expense is deductible only if **"wholly and exclusively"** incurred for the purposes of the trade or profession (Section 81(2)(a)). The deduction also requires the expense to be of a **revenue (not capital)** nature (Section 81(2)(f)).

**Common deductible items:**
- Cost of goods sold, raw materials, sub-contractor labour (subject to RCT compliance — Section 530 TCA).
- Employee wages, employer's PRSI, pension contributions to Revenue-approved schemes.
- Rent, rates, utilities, insurance (except life insurance on employees outside Revenue-approved scheme).
- Repairs and maintenance (capital improvements are not deductible — they go to the capital allowances pool).
- Bad debts (specific, not general provision).
- Professional fees (audit, legal — but capital legal fees on acquisitions are not deductible).
- Travel and subsistence (per Revenue civil-service rates for employees; reasonable trade-purpose justification).

### 4.2 Non-Deductible Items

| Item | Reference |
|---|---|
| Entertainment of customers / clients | Section 840 TCA |
| Penalties, fines (criminal or regulatory) | Case law; not "wholly and exclusively" |
| Depreciation per accounts | Replaced by Section 284 capital allowances |
| Goodwill amortisation per accounts | Replaced by Section 291A specified intangibles regime |
| Capital expenditure | Section 81(2)(f) — relief via capital allowances |
| Dividends / distributions | Not a deductible expense; subject to dividend withholding tax (DWT) under Section 172A |
| Corporation tax itself | Not deductible |
| General provisions for doubtful debts | Only specific bad-debt write-offs allowed |
| Pre-trading expenditure (other than Section 82) | Section 82 allows 3-year pre-trading expenses on first day of trading |
| Excessive director remuneration | "Wholly and exclusively" test plus Section 130 distribution recharacterisation risk |
| Interest on late-paid taxes | Section 1080 interest is not deductible |

### 4.3 Anti-Hybrid Rules — Sections 835AG–835AY TCA

ATAD II hybrid mismatch rules deny deductions or include income where a hybrid mismatch creates a deduction-without-inclusion (D/NI), double-deduction (DD), or imported mismatch. Applies for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020. **Conservative default:** Flag any cross-border interest, royalty, or service deduction to a related party as a hybrid-mismatch screening question.

### 4.4 Interest Limitation Rule — Section 835AY TCA

ATAD I ILR effective from 1 January 2022. Net interest expense deduction capped at **30% of tax-EBITDA** unless the de minimis threshold (€3 million) applies or the equity escape / group ratio rule provides relief. Disallowed interest carries forward.

---

## Section 5 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 5.1 R&D Tax Credit — Section 766 TCA

**Rate (FA 2024 onwards):** **30%** of qualifying R&D expenditure (raised from 25%). Applies to accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2024.

**Qualifying expenditure:**
- Salaries of R&D staff (apportioned to qualifying time).
- Consumables used in R&D.
- Plant and machinery used wholly and exclusively for R&D (capital allowances accelerated where used in R&D).
- Subcontracted R&D (Section 766(1)(b)(vii)) capped at **15%** of in-house R&D spend or €100,000 (whichever greater).
- Outsourced to a third-level institution capped at **5%** of in-house spend.

**Qualifying activity:** Must satisfy the **Frascati Manual** definition (systematic, investigative, creative, novel, uncertain). Must be in a "field of science or technology" (Section 766(1)(a)). Software development qualifies where it meets the technological-uncertainty test (Revenue R&D Guidelines).

**Refundability — Section 766C:** The credit can be (i) offset against CT of the claim period, (ii) carried forward, or (iii) **paid as a cash refund in 3 instalments** over 33 months:
- **Instalment 1:** Greater of €50,000 (FA 2024 raised threshold) or 50% of the credit — payable on filing.
- **Instalment 2:** 60% of the remaining balance — 12 months later.
- **Instalment 3:** Final balance — 24 months later.

**Filing:** Form CT1 R&D section; supporting "R&D Tax Credit Claim" documentation (Section 766(7B)) must accompany the claim. Revenue has 4 years to challenge.

**Conservative default:** Do not claim R&D credit until a contemporaneous technical report meeting the Frascati Manual criteria is on file. Engage a specialist for borderline software / process improvement claims.

### 5.2 Knowledge Development Box — Sections 769G–769R TCA

**Effective rate:** **6.25%** on qualifying profits from qualifying intellectual property (patents, copyrighted software, IP equivalent to a patentable invention for small companies).

**OECD modified nexus approach:** Qualifying profits are restricted by the **nexus fraction** = (qualifying R&D expenditure × 1.3) / total expenditure on the IP asset. The 30% uplift is the OECD-permitted "up-lift" for outsourcing or acquisition costs.

**Mechanism:** Election made in the CT1; profits from qualifying IP are computed using a tracking-and-tracing methodology; the qualifying profit is taxed at the standard 12.5%, with a deduction equal to **50% of the qualifying profit** giving an effective 6.25% rate.

**Extension:** FA 2024 extended KDB to accounting periods beginning before **1 January 2027**.

**Conservative default:** Do not elect KDB without a documented IP asset, nexus computation, and tracking-and-tracing system in place. The compliance burden is material; benefit only arises for material qualifying IP profits.

### 5.3 Section 110 Securitisation SPVs

**Legislation:** Section 110 TCA grants a special tax regime to "qualifying companies" holding qualifying assets (financial assets, plant and machinery, commodities). Profits are computed under Case III with deductions for profit-participating notes (PPN) interest, effectively allowing tax-neutral cash flow-through to noteholders, provided strict conditions are met:

- **Section 110(1):** Qualifying company definition (Irish-resident, ≥ €10 million qualifying assets at inception, notification to Revenue within 8 weeks).
- **Section 110(4):** Treats PPN interest as deductible even if profit-dependent (subject to Section 110(5A) anti-avoidance from FA 2016 onwards excluding certain Irish real estate income).
- **Section 110(5A):** Carves out Irish land-derived income — Section 110 deduction restricted for "specified property business" profits.

**Common uses:** CLO / CDO structures, aircraft leasing, securitisation, structured finance.

**Conservative default:** Section 110 deals require specialist structuring counsel. Do not compute or opine on Section 110 positions without explicit reviewer engagement (R-IE-CT-3).

### 5.4 Transfer Pricing — Part 35A TCA (Sections 835A–835HB)

**Scope:** Irish TP rules align with the **OECD Transfer Pricing Guidelines 2022** (Section 835D). Apply to associated-enterprise transactions (≥ 50% common ownership, control test).

**Documentation:**
- **Master File** required if consolidated group revenue ≥ **€250 million** (Section 835G).
- **Local File** required if consolidated group revenue ≥ **€50 million** (Section 835G).
- Documentation must be in place by the CT1 filing date; produced within 30 days of Revenue request.
- **CbCR** required for groups with consolidated revenue ≥ €750 million (Section 891H).

**Small / medium enterprise exemption — Section 835E:** SMEs (≤ 250 employees AND turnover ≤ €50m OR balance sheet ≤ €43m) are largely exempt from formal TP documentation but the arm's-length principle still applies.

**Penalties:** No documentation = restricted access to the protective notification regime; potential tax-geared penalties under Section 1077E.

### 5.5 Foreign Tax Credit — Schedule 24 TCA

Double-tax relief on foreign-sourced income (dividends, interest, royalties) via credit (Schedule 24) or deduction. Credit limited to the Irish tax on the same income. Pooling rules permit excess credits on dividends from EU/treaty subsidiaries to be carried back 1 year or forward indefinitely (Schedule 24 para 9I).

### 5.6 Participation Exemption on Foreign Dividends (NEW — FA 2024)

**Legislation:** Section 831B TCA (inserted by Finance Act 2024), effective for distributions received on or after **1 January 2025**.

**Mechanism:** Election-based participation exemption for foreign dividends from EU/EEA/tax-treaty subsidiaries where the receiving company holds ≥ 5% of the share capital for ≥ 12 months and certain anti-abuse conditions are met. Removes the prior "tax-and-credit" double-tax relief mechanism for opted-in dividends, replacing it with full exemption.

**Conservative default:** Do not elect Section 831B exemption without checking subsidiary jurisdiction listing and the 5%/12-month holding test.

### 5.7 Outbound Payments Defensive Measure — Section 817U TCA (FA 2023)

Effective **1 April 2024**. Withholding tax / additional CT charge on outbound interest, royalty, and dividend payments to associated entities in zero-tax or EU non-cooperative jurisdictions. Applies to payments where the recipient is not subject to a minimum 9% headline rate (or is in a Annex I non-cooperative jurisdiction). Reviewer must screen all outbound related-party payment streams.

### 5.8 Start-Up Relief — Section 486C TCA

Relief from CT for new trading companies in the first 5 accounting periods. Tax liability up to €40,000 fully relieved; partial relief between €40,000 and €60,000. Linked to employer's PRSI contributions (Section 486C(7) — up to €5,000 per employee, capped at the lesser of the PRSI paid and the relief). Extended to qualifying companies commencing trade up to 31 December 2026 (FA 2024).

### 5.9 Three-Year Tax Holiday for Certain Start-Ups (Section 486C interaction)

Note: Section 486C is the principal start-up relief. There is no separate "tax holiday" regime equivalent to Indonesia's. Reviewer should not confuse the two.

## Section 6 — Worked Examples

### 6.1 Start-Up Trading Company — All Trading Income

**Facts:** TechCo Ltd, Irish-resident, accounting period 1 January 2025 – 31 December 2025.
- Trading profit (Case I) per accounts: €500,000.
- Depreciation (added back): €20,000.
- Capital allowances on plant: €25,000.
- R&D qualifying expenditure: €100,000 (claimed at 30%).
- No non-trading income.
- Prior-year CT liability: €0 (first year of trading) — qualifies for Section 486C start-up relief.

**Computation:**

```
Case I trading profit per accounts             500,000
Add: depreciation                               20,000
                                               -------
Adjusted profit                                520,000
Less: capital allowances (Section 284)         (25,000)
                                               -------
Taxable trading profit                         495,000

CT @ 12.5%                                      61,875
Less: R&D tax credit (Section 766)             
       30% × €100,000                          (30,000)
                                               -------
CT before start-up relief                       31,875

Section 486C start-up relief
(liability < €40,000 — fully relieved,
subject to employer's PRSI cap)               (31,875)
                                               -------
CT payable                                           0

R&D credit excess / payable                     
(if credit > tax liability, refundable
in 3 instalments per Section 766C — N/A here
because credit was fully used)                       0
```

**Preliminary tax (small company):** Because TechCo is a "small company" (CT liability ≤ €200,000), it may use the prior-year (zero) test — no preliminary tax due. The 2026 preliminary tax will be 90% of 2026 estimate or 100% of 2025 (€0), whichever is lower-risk.

**Filing:** Form CT1 via ROS by **23 September 2026** (9 months after FY-end, 23rd of that month) with iXBRL accounts.

### 6.2 Mid-Size MNE — Pillar Two In Scope

**Facts:** GlobalCo Ireland Ltd, Irish-resident, fiscal year 1 January 2025 – 31 December 2025. Wholly owned by US-headquartered group with consolidated revenue €1.2 billion for FY 2024 and FY 2023 (in scope of Pillar Two from FY 2025 since €750M threshold met for 2 of last 4 FYs).

- Trading profit (Case I): €40,000,000.
- Foreign branch dividend income (Case III, qualifying for Section 626B exemption on capital portion; passive dividend portion): €3,000,000.
- Substance: 80 Irish employees with payroll cost €8,000,000; tangible assets net book value €15,000,000.

**Computation — Ireland CT layer:**

```
Case I trading profit                        40,000,000
CT @ 12.5%                                    5,000,000

Case III foreign dividend (passive)           3,000,000
CT @ 25%                                        750,000
Less: foreign tax credit (Schedule 24)        (450,000)  [assume 15% foreign WHT]
                                              ---------
Net CT on Case III                              300,000

Total Irish CT before Pillar Two              5,300,000
```

**Pillar Two ETR test (Irish jurisdiction):**

```
GloBE Income (simplified) =                  43,000,000
Adjusted Covered Taxes =                      5,300,000
ETR = 5,300,000 / 43,000,000 =                    12.33%

Required minimum =                                15.00%
Shortfall =                                         2.67%

Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE) — 2025 rates:
  9.8% × payroll  9.8% × 8,000,000 =          784,000
  7.8% × tangible 7.8% × 15,000,000 =       1,170,000
                                            ---------
  SBIE total                                1,954,000

Excess profit = 43,000,000 − 1,954,000 =   41,046,000
Top-up tax = 2.67% × 41,046,000 =           1,095,928
```

**QDMTT collects this €1,095,928 in Ireland (rather than via the parent IIR).** The QDMTT is paid alongside CT but reported via the Pillar Two return / GIR.

**Conservative default applied:** Figures illustrative only — actual QDMTT computation requires the full GloBE rules, deferred-tax adjustments, transitional safe-harbour testing, and specialist software. This skill flags the in-scope position and routes to a Pillar Two specialist (R-IE-CT-4).

### 6.3 Mixed Trading and Rental Company

**Facts:** PropTradeCo Ltd, accounting period FY 2025.
- Case I trading profit: €200,000.
- Case V Irish rental profit (net): €80,000.
- Close company; undistributed Case V income at 18-month mark.

```
CT on Case I @ 12.5% × 200,000               25,000
CT on Case V @ 25%  ×  80,000                20,000
                                             ------
Total CT                                     45,000

Close-company surcharge — Section 440
20% × undistributed Case V = 20% × 60,000*   12,000

* 80,000 net Case V less 25% CT (20,000) =
  60,000 distributable, assumed not
  distributed within 18 months
                                             ------
Total liability                              57,000
```

**Conservative default:** Discuss dividend strategy with reviewer to mitigate Section 440 surcharge.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the 12.5% trading rate to passive income — Section 21A imposes 25%.
- NEVER apply the Knowledge Development Box without a documented nexus computation and tracking-and-tracing system.
- NEVER claim the R&D tax credit without a Frascati Manual-compliant technical record.
- NEVER assume Pillar Two is out of scope — verify the €750M consolidated revenue 2-of-4-FY test.
- NEVER compute QDMTT / IIR / UTPR without specialist GIR software and CTA engagement (R-IE-CT-4).
- NEVER ignore the close-company surcharges (Sections 440, 441) for owner-managed companies.
- NEVER deduct depreciation per accounts — use Section 284 capital allowances.

- NEVER ignore the Section 291A 80% trading-income cap on specified intangibles.
- NEVER assume iXBRL exemption — default to filing.

- NEVER assume same-period correspondence in group relief — periods must overlap for the relevant portion.
- NEVER skip transfer pricing documentation for groups ≥ €50M consolidated revenue (Section 835G).
