description: ALWAYS USE THIS SKILL when a user asks for help preparing an Irish tax return AND mentions freelancing, self-employment, sole trader, LTD, contractor, or PSC in Ireland. Trigger on phrases like "Ireland tax return", "Form 11 Ireland", "Form 12 Ireland", "Irish sole trader", "Irish LTD CT1", "ROS Revenue Online Service", "self-assessment Ireland", "preliminary tax Ireland", "PRSI Class S", "USC Ireland", "Irish VAT registration", "Pillar Two QDMTT Ireland", or any similar phrasing where the user is an Irish tax resident self-employed individual, sole trader, partner, or small LTD director-shareholder. This is the REQUIRED entry point for the Irish freelance / SME workflow — every downstream skill in the stack (ie-income-tax-form11, ie-preliminary-tax, ie-prsi-class-s, ie-usc, ireland-vat-return, ie-corporation-tax, ie-paye, ie-payroll, ie-cgt, ie-cat, ie-formation, ie-return-assembly) depends on this skill running first. Uses ask_user_input_v0-style structured questions. Irish tax residents only (full-year residents under Section 819 TCA 1997, plus the 280-day combined test). ALWAYS read this skill first when starting an Irish freelance / SME tax workflow.

# Ireland — Freelance / SME Intake — Skill v1.0

## What this file is

The intake orchestrator for Irish-resident self-employed individuals, sole traders, partners, and small LTD (private company limited by shares) director-shareholders, including personal service companies (PSCs). Every downstream Irish content skill depends on this skill producing a structured intake package first.

Job: (1) confirm the taxpayer is Irish tax resident under Section 819 TCA 1997, (2) determine domicile (resident-non-domiciled taxpayers attract the remittance basis under Section 71 TCA 1997), (3) classify the regime (sole trader / partnership → Form 11 income tax + PRSI Class S + USC; LTD → CT1 corporation tax + director Form 11; large MNE → Pillar Two top-up via QDMTT), (4) identify downstream skills to run, (5) hand off to `ie-return-assembly`. Outputs addressed to a credentialed Irish tax reviewer (a Chartered Tax Adviser (CTA) of the Irish Tax Institute, an ACA / ACCA / CPA, or an AITI-qualified agent registered on ROS). The reviewer signs off — this skill is not the preparer of record.

```

Parallel routing (independent of entity):

- Turnover > EUR 85,000 goods / EUR 42,500 services (rolling 12 months) → VAT registration mandatory → route `ireland-vat-return`.
- Employees → route `ie-paye` + `ie-payroll`.
- Disposal of chargeable asset in 2025 → route `ie-cgt`.
- Received gift or inheritance in 2025 → route `ie-cat`.
- Entity unclear or formation needed → route `ie-formation`.
- Always final → `ie-return-assembly`.

## Section 2 — Workflow runbook (order of operations)

Strict order. Do not narrate steps.

1. **Opening** — one-line greeting + flow summary + reviewer reminder, then launch the refusal sweep.
2. **Refusal sweep** — single `ask_user_input_v0` call with the 5 questions in Section 5.1.
3. **Document dump** — ask user to upload everything at once (bank statements, sales invoices, purchase invoices, prior Form 11 / CT1, ROS notices of assessment, P30 / PAYE summaries, payroll registers, VAT3 returns, RCT records if construction). Do not insist on bank statements alone.
4. **Inference pass** — parse every document; extract turnover, expenses, PAYE withheld, prior preliminary tax, VAT collected / reclaimed.
5. **Regime classification** — apply Section 4 decision tree using inferred turnover + sweep answers.
6. **Confirmation** — show inferred summary + proposed regime + downstream-skill list; invite corrections.
7. **Gap filling** — `ask_user_input_v0` only for items documents cannot answer (domicile, PPSN / TRN, marital status / joint-assessment election, ROS access).
8. **Handoff** — produce Section 6 summary and invoke `ie-return-assembly`.

Operating principles: use `ask_user_input_v0` for multi-choice; free text only for names / PPSN / TRN. Batch up to 3 related independent questions. Never re-ask documents-visible facts. Irish terms in parentheses on first mention (e.g., "Personal Public Service Number (PPSN)"). All amounts in EUR.

---

## Section 3 — Required inputs

Some inferred from documents, the rest gap-filled. All mandatory before handoff.

- **Identity / registration:** legal name, PPSN (Personal Public Service Number — individuals) and / or TRN (Tax Reference Number — entities / sole-trader trade name), date of birth, marital / civil-partnership status (single / married-separate / married-joint / civil-partner), Revenue district office, ROS digital certificate active (yes / no).
- **Residence & domicile:** day count in Ireland 2025 (and 2024 if combined test relevant), domicile of origin and any domicile of choice, ordinary residence status (3 consecutive years), split-year treatment under Section 822 TCA 1997 if arrival / departure year.
- **Entity:** sole trader / partnership (general or limited) / LTD (CRO number, date of incorporation, accounting year-end) / DAC / CLG. PSC indicators: single director-shareholder, services to one principal client, IR35-style risk (Revenue eBrief 99/19, Karshan Supreme Court judgment 2023).
- **Revenue:** 2025 gross turnover, monthly / quarterly turnover detail, domestic vs intra-EU vs export mix (services to EU B2B → reverse charge VIES; goods to EU B2B → zero rate with VIES; exports outside EU → zero rate).
- **Tax history:** prior Form 11 / Form 12 / CT1 for 2022, 2023, 2024; outstanding preliminary tax / balancing payments; carried-forward losses (Section 381 / Section 382 TCA 1997); capital allowances pool (Section 284 TCA 1997).
- **Operational:** employee count (PAYE / PRSI / USC obligations under Section 985 TCA 1997), VAT registration (mandatory or elective under Section 9 VAT Consolidation Act 2010), RCT (Relevant Contracts Tax) if construction / forestry / meat processing principal (Section 530A TCA 1997), Local Property Tax (LPT) discharged.
- **Documents:** bank statements 2025, sales invoices, purchase invoices, prior Form 11 / CT1, ROS notices of assessment, P60 / employment-detail summary if also employed, payroll register if employer, VAT3 returns, eBrief / RTD annual VAT return, RCT deduction summary.

## Section 4 — Regime decision tree with thresholds and citations

All thresholds 2025-effective (Finance Act 2024, Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, Finance Act 2023).

### 4.1 Residency gate — Section 819 TCA 1997

Irish tax resident = present in Ireland for 183 days in the tax year, OR 280 days combined in the current year plus the immediately preceding year (with at least 30 days in each year). A "day" is any day on which the individual is present in the State (the historic midnight rule was abolished by Finance Act 2008; the current rule under Section 819(4) is "any part of a day").

- Full-year resident → continue.
- Part-year resident with split-year relief (Section 822 TCA 1997 — arrival year for employment income, departure year for employment income; **does not apply to self-employment / trading income**) → **REFUSE** for split-year self-employment; refer to a Chartered Tax Adviser.
- Non-resident → **REFUSE**.

### 4.2 Domicile gate — Section 71 TCA 1997 + common-law domicile rules

Domicile is a common-law concept (domicile of origin, domicile of choice). Resident-non-domiciled individuals are taxed on Irish-source income and gains in full, but foreign income and gains only when **remitted** to Ireland (the remittance basis). The remittance basis does **not** apply to UK-source income for Irish-resident-non-domiciled persons (UK income is taxed on the arising basis under the Ireland-UK DTA / Section 73 TCA 1997).

If domicile is unclear or foreign → flag for reviewer; route `ie-income-tax-form11` with `remittance_basis_election` flag. Do not assume.

### 4.3 Entity gate

- **Sole trader / partnership:** Form 11 self-assessment. Trading income taxed at marginal rates (20% standard band up to EUR 44,000 single / EUR 53,000 one-earner married 2025; 40% above). Partnerships file Form 1 (Partnership) plus each partner's share on their own Form 11. Route `ie-income-tax-form11`.
- **LTD trading:** CT1 corporation tax. Trading income at 12.5% (Section 21 TCA 1997). Non-trading (passive) income at 25%. Close-company surcharge of 20% on undistributed investment / rental income (Section 440 TCA 1997) and 15% on undistributed service-company income (Section 441 TCA 1997). Director-shareholder also files Form 11 for own salary (Schedule E) and dividends (Schedule F). Route `ie-corporation-tax` + `ie-income-tax-form11`.
- **LTD non-trading / investment holding:** CT1 at 25%; close-company surcharge likely. Route `ie-corporation-tax`.
- **Entity unclear / formation needed:** route `ie-formation`.

Out-of-scope refusals at this gate:

- LTDs with > 50 employees → refer to in-house finance + audit firm.
- Group structures with Irish parent and overseas subsidiaries → refer to specialist.
- Large MNEs (consolidated revenue ≥ EUR 750m in 2 of last 4 years) caught by Pillar Two → QDMTT / IIR / UTPR under Part 4A TCA 1997 (inserted by Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, transposing Council Directive (EU) 2022/2523) → **REFUSE**; refer to Big 4 / specialist.

### 4.4 VAT registration gate — Section 6 + Section 9 VAT Consolidation Act 2010; Finance Act 2024

VAT registration is mandatory when turnover in any rolling 12-month period exceeds:

- **EUR 85,000** for supplies of goods (raised from EUR 80,000 by Finance Act 2023, then from EUR 80,000 to EUR 85,000 effective 1 January 2024).
- **EUR 42,500** for supplies of services (raised from EUR 37,500 to EUR 42,500 by Finance Act 2024, effective 1 January 2025).
- Mixed supplies: the **services** threshold (EUR 42,500) applies if services are more than 10% of total turnover; otherwise the goods threshold applies.
- Distance sales into Ireland from another EU Member State: EUR 10,000 EU-wide threshold (OSS / IOSS).
- Acquisitions from EU Member States by an exempt or non-taxable person: EUR 41,000.

If above threshold → route `ireland-vat-return`. Below threshold → elective registration may still be advantageous (input VAT recovery); route only if user elects or reviewer flags. VAT rates 2025: 23% standard, 13.5% reduced (most services, construction, restaurant food was at 9% then back to 13.5% from 1 September 2023), 9% reduced (gas and electricity to end-October 2025 under Finance Act 2024 extension; newspapers; some e-publications), 4.8% livestock, 0% (food staples, children's clothing, exports, intra-EU B2B with VIES).

### 4.5 PRSI Class S gate — Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, Section 20A; Social Welfare Act 2023

Self-employed individuals (sole traders, partners, proprietary directors with ≥ 50% shareholding) pay PRSI Class S on reckonable income (trading income + investment income + rental income). Rate increased from 4.0% to **4.1% effective 1 October 2024** (Social Welfare Act 2023) — the full 2025 year is at 4.1%. Minimum annual reckonable income of EUR 5,000 to be liable. Minimum annual contribution EUR 650. Class S covers State Pension (Contributory), Maternity / Paternity / Adoptive Benefit, Treatment Benefit, Widow's / Widower's Pension, Invalidity Pension (added 2017), Jobseeker's Benefit Self-Employed (added November 2019). Route `ie-prsi-class-s`.

### 4.6 USC gate — Part 18D TCA 1997, Sections 531AM–531AAF; Finance Act 2024

Universal Social Charge applies to gross income (no PRSI / pension relief shelter). 2025 rates (per Finance Act 2024, which reduced the 4% band rate to 3% and widened the 2% band):

- 0.5% on income up to EUR 12,012.
- 2.0% on the next EUR 15,370 (so up to EUR 27,382 — band widened from EUR 25,760).
- 3.0% on the next EUR 42,662 (so up to EUR 70,044) — **rate reduced from 4% to 3% by Finance Act 2024**.
- 8.0% on the balance above EUR 70,044.
- **Self-employed surcharge of 3% on non-PAYE income above EUR 100,000** under Section 531AN(2) TCA 1997 — making the effective top USC rate 11% on self-employment income over EUR 100k.

Exemption thresholds: total income ≤ EUR 13,000 (full exemption); medical-card holders + over-70s capped at 2%. Route `ie-usc`.

### 4.7 Preliminary tax gate — Section 958 TCA 1997; Section 959AN

Sole traders / partners on self-assessment must pay preliminary tax by **31 October 2025** (or the ROS extended deadline — typically mid-November — if filing **and** paying via ROS). The amount must be the **lower** of:

- **90%** of the final liability for 2025 (current-year basis), OR
- **100%** of the final liability for 2024 (prior-year basis), OR
- **105%** of the final liability for 2023 (pre-prior-year basis) — only available where preliminary tax is paid by direct debit and the pre-prior year is not zero.

Failure → interest at 0.0219% per day (~8% annualised) under Section 1080 TCA 1997 + surcharge of 5% (filed within 2 months late) or 10% (later) under Section 1084 TCA 1997. Route `ie-preliminary-tax`.

### 4.8 Employer gate — Section 985 TCA 1997; PAYE Modernisation (Real-Time Reporting) from 1 January 2019

Employees → operate PAYE / PRSI / USC in real time via ROS payroll software, file Payroll Submission Requests (PSRs) on or before each payday. Employer PRSI 8.8% on weekly earnings ≤ EUR 496 / 11.05% above (Class A1 — 2025 rate increased from 11.05% to **11.15% effective 1 October 2024**, so full 2025 is 11.15%). Route `ie-paye` + `ie-payroll`.

### 4.9 CGT gate — Section 28 TCA 1997 et seq.

Disposal of a chargeable asset (shares, property other than principal private residence, crypto, business assets) in 2025 → CGT at **33%** on gains above EUR 1,270 annual exemption (Section 601 TCA 1997). Payment deadlines:

- Disposals 1 January – 30 November 2025 → CGT due **15 December 2025**.
- Disposals 1 – 31 December 2025 → CGT due **31 January 2026**.

Return (Form CG1 for non-Form-11 filers, or via Form 11 for self-assessed) due by 31 October 2026. Route `ie-cgt`.

### 4.10 CAT gate — Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003

Received a gift or inheritance in 2025 → CAT at **33%** on the value above the relevant Group threshold (Finance Act 2024 thresholds, effective from 2 October 2024 Budget Day):

- **Group A** (child of disponer): EUR 400,000 (raised from EUR 335,000).
- **Group B** (sibling, niece / nephew, lineal ancestor / descendant other than child): EUR 40,000 (raised from EUR 32,500).
- **Group C** (all others): EUR 20,000 (raised from EUR 16,250).

Pay-and-file by 31 October of the year following the valuation date if the valuation date falls between 1 September and 31 August. Route `ie-cat`.

### 4.11 ROS digital-certificate channel

Form 11, CT1, VAT3, RTD, payroll PSRs, and preliminary tax are all filed through Revenue Online Service (ROS). If the user does not have an active ROS digital certificate, flag in `open_flags` — ROS onboarding takes 5–8 working days (RAN / dormant-cert reset). Without ROS access the user falls outside the ROS-extended pay-and-file deadline.

---

## Section 5 — Questions to ask the user

| Q5 financial services / funds | **REFUSE** |

### 5.2 Secondary batched questions

- **Q6 Marital status / assessment:** Single | Married, jointly assessed | Married, separately assessed | Married, single-treatment | Civil-partnership joint | Widowed / surviving civil partner | Lone parent.
- **Q7 Employees in 2025:** None | 1–5 | 6–20 | > 20.

| Q7 > 20 | flag (larger payroll — verify scope) |
| Q8 not registered + Q4 above threshold | flag **VAT registration overdue**; reviewer registers via ROS TR2 / TR1 |
| Q8 cancelled / deregistered | flag for reviewer (final VAT3 + RTD required) |
| Q9 not paid / first year | flag `preliminary_tax_2024_open`; route `ie-preliminary-tax` |

### 5.3 Capital events question

- **Q10 In 2025 did you:** Dispose of a chargeable asset (shares, second property, crypto, business) | Receive a gift or inheritance | Both | Neither | Not sure.

Routing:

| Answer | Action |
|---|---|
| Q10 disposal | route `ie-cgt`; capture disposal date for 15 December vs 31 January window |
| Q10 gift / inheritance | route `ie-cat`; capture relationship to disponer for Group A / B / C |
| Q10 both | route both |
| Q10 neither | skip |

### 5.4 Foreign income question

- **Q11 In 2025 did you have any foreign-source income, foreign bank accounts, foreign rental property, foreign pension, or foreign shares?** Yes (single item) | Yes (multiple) | No | Not sure.

Any "Yes" → flag `foreign_source_income`; reviewer confirms (a) DTA treatment (Ireland has ~75 DTAs), (b) foreign tax credit under Schedule 24 TCA 1997, (c) remittance-basis applicability if non-domiciled, (d) Form 11 Panel S (foreign income) entries.

"No" / "dormant" / "issues" → flag in `open_flags`. ROS is the only filing channel for Form 11, CT1, VAT3, and preliminary tax. Without ROS the pay-and-file deadline is 31 October (not the ROS-extended mid-November date).

### 5.6 Onboarding fallback — no PPSN / TRN yet

If the user has no PPSN (individual) or no TRN (newly formed entity), the workflow cannot complete. Flag `no_ppsn_trn`:

- Individual without PPSN → refer to DSP (Department of Social Protection) Intreo or MyWelfare PPSN application. Cannot file Form 11 / Form 12 without PPSN.
- Entity without TRN → file Form TR1 (sole trader) / TR2 (company) via ROS or paper; TRN issues within 5 working days. Newly incorporated LTDs auto-receive a TRN on CRO registration if Form TR2 is filed concurrently with CRO Form A1.
- Director without PPSN (non-resident director of Irish LTD) → since 11 June 2023 (Companies (Corporate Enforcement Authority) Act 2021, s. 35) all directors filing with the CRO must have a PPSN, a CRO-issued IPN (Identified Person Number) via Form VIF, or an RBO PPSN-verification number. Flag `director_ppsn_required`.

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

When uncertain, prefer the safer (higher-tax / stricter-compliance) outcome and flag. All defaults visible to reviewer in `conservative_defaults_applied`.

| Ambiguity | Conservative default |
|---|---|
| Residency borderline (~180 days, no combined-test data) | Assume non-resident → REFUSE; flag for day-count proof |
| Domicile unclear | Assume foreign domicile → flag `remittance_basis_review`; tax foreign income on arising basis pending reviewer call |
| Turnover near services threshold (EUR 40k–EUR 45k) | Assume above threshold → VAT registration mandatory |
| Turnover near goods threshold (EUR 80k–EUR 90k) | Assume above threshold → VAT registration mandatory |
| Activity mix near 10% services | Assume services > 10% → apply services threshold (EUR 42,500) |
| PSC vs employee unclear | Assume PSC with IR35 / Karshan risk; flag for reviewer |
| Sole trader vs partnership unclear (shared trade) | Assume partnership → Form 1 required |
| Preliminary tax base unclear | Apply 100% prior-year safe harbour (highest of available bases) |
| CGT disposal date near 30 November | Assume pre-30 November → 15 December payment window |
| CAT relationship unclear | Assume Group C (lowest threshold) |
| PRSI minimum (~EUR 5,000) | Assume above → flag Class S liability |
| Foreign income flagged but DTA unclear | Tax on arising basis with no FTC; reviewer to claim credit |
| ROS access unknown | Assume not active; flag for onboarding |
| Director PPSN status unknown (non-resident director) | Assume PPSN / IPN required under CCEA 2021 s. 35; flag |

## Section 8 — Refusal handling

Refusals fire from the refusal sweep or during inference. Protocol: stop the workflow, state the reason in one sentence, recommend a Chartered Tax Adviser (CTA, Irish Tax Institute) or AITI-qualified ROS agent, do not work around.

In-scope refusals:

- Part-year resident self-employment (Section 822 TCA 1997 does not cover trading income).
- Non-resident.
- Turnover > EUR 50m (out of small-SME scope).
- LTDs with > 50 employees.
- Group structures with Irish parent and overseas subsidiaries.
- Large MNEs in Pillar Two (QDMTT / IIR / UTPR under Part 4A TCA 1997, Finance (No. 2) Act 2023, transposing EU Directive 2022/2523) — consolidated revenue ≥ EUR 750m in 2 of last 4 years.
- Financial services / regulated investment funds.
- Charities / approved bodies under Section 207 / 208 TCA 1997 — separate compliance regime.
- Trusts and estates (Section 769 TCA 1997 et seq.).

Sample: "Stop — you arrived in Ireland in May 2025, so you are a part-year resident. Split-year relief under Section 822 TCA 1997 covers employment income only, not trading / self-employment income, so I cannot prepare your Form 11 for 2025 alone. You need a Chartered Tax Adviser (CTA) to handle the apportionment and the prior-jurisdiction interaction."

## Section 9 — Self-checks before handoff

Run all 14 before invoking `ie-return-assembly`. Any failure → fix, do not hand off.

1. Refusal sweep used `ask_user_input_v0`, not prose.
2. Residency confirmed (full-year or combined-test); part-year → refused.
3. Domicile captured; remittance-basis flag set where appropriate.
4. Entity type set; PSC / IR35 flag set if single director-shareholder with one principal client.
5. Annual turnover recorded in EUR with bucket band.
6. VAT threshold gate applied to the correct threshold (goods EUR 85,000 vs services EUR 42,500); registration / overdue flag set.
7. PRSI Class S applicability set; minimum EUR 5,000 reckonable confirmed.
8. USC bands applied; 3% self-employed surcharge flagged if non-PAYE income > EUR 100,000.
9. Preliminary tax base selected (lower of 90% CY / 100% PY / 105% PPY).
10. Employee count set; `ie-paye` + `ie-payroll` in downstream list if > 0.
11. CGT and CAT events captured.
12. Foreign income flagged where applicable; DTA / Schedule 24 / remittance-basis review noted.
13. ROS certificate status captured; PPSN / TRN gaps flagged.
14. All conservative defaults recorded with citation; reviewer disclaimer present in opening + handoff.

## Section 10 — Final handoff to ie-return-assembly

Once gap-filling and self-checks pass, output a short handoff message naming (a) taxpayer + entity + Revenue district + ROS status, (b) regime selected with headline computation citation, (c) downstream skills in run-order, (d) skills explicitly not running and why, (e) reviewer reminder (CTA / ACA / ACCA / AITI sign-off via ROS). Then invoke `ie-return-assembly` with the Section 6.2 package.

Example (sole trader, services, VAT-registered, no employees, single):

> Intake complete. Aoife Ní Bhriain, sole trader (IT consultancy), PPSN 1234567T, Revenue district Dublin City Centre, ROS active. Full-year resident 2025, Irish-domiciled. 2025 turnover EUR 92,000 (services) → VAT-registered (above EUR 42,500 services threshold). Regime: Form 11 income tax at 20% / 40% bands + PRSI Class S 4.1% + USC 0.5% / 2% / 3% / 8% (no 3% self-employed surcharge — income below EUR 100,000). Preliminary tax due 31 October 2025 (ROS-extended mid-November); applying 100% prior-year safe harbour from 2024 Form 11. Running: ie-income-tax-form11, ie-preliminary-tax, ie-prsi-class-s, ie-usc, ireland-vat-return, ie-return-assembly. Not running: ie-corporation-tax, ie-paye, ie-payroll, ie-cgt, ie-cat, ie-formation. Needs CTA / AITI sign-off before ROS submission. Handing off now.
