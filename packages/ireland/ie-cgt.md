## Section 3 — Tier 1 — chargeable persons, chargeable assets, computation

### 3.1 Chargeable persons (TCA s. 28, s. 29)

CGT is charged on the chargeable gains accruing to:

- A **resident or ordinarily resident individual** — on worldwide chargeable assets, subject to the remittance basis where non-domiciled (gains on foreign assets taxed only on remittance to Ireland).
- A **resident company** — generally within the corporation tax framework, but disposals of certain assets (notably development land) remain within CGT.
- A **non-resident person** — on Irish-specified assets only: **land and buildings in Ireland, mineral rights and exploration rights in the Irish State or Continental Shelf, unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from Irish land or mineral rights, and assets used for the purposes of a trade carried on in Ireland through a branch or agency**.

### 3.2 Chargeable assets (TCA s. 532)

All forms of property are chargeable assets, including:

- Land and buildings (Irish and foreign, for residents).
- Shares and securities of any company.
- Goodwill and other intangible business assets.
- Options, debts (subject to TCA s. 541), and incorporeal property.
- Currency other than the euro.
- Crypto-assets — Revenue treats crypto as a chargeable asset for CGT (no specific carve-out).
- Chattels — but with exemptions for tangible movable property sold for ≤ €2,540 (TCA s. 602) and for wasting chattels under TCA s. 603.

### 3.3 Computation formula

Chargeable gain = Disposal proceeds − Incidental costs of disposal − (Allowable acquisition cost + Incidental costs of acquisition + Enhancement expenditure)

Where indexation applies (pre-2003 acquisitions only), the acquisition cost and enhancement expenditure incurred up to 31 December 2002 are multiplied by the relevant statutory indexation factor frozen at 2003 levels.

Annual CGT computation:

1. Compute the chargeable gain on each disposal in the tax year.
2. Aggregate gains; deduct allowable losses (current-year first, then losses brought forward).
3. Deduct the annual exemption of €1,270 (non-transferable between spouses).
4. Apply the 33% rate (or 10% Entrepreneur Relief rate on qualifying portion).

### 3.4 Allowable deductions (TCA s. 552)

- Original acquisition cost.
- Incidental costs of acquisition (solicitor's fees, stamp duty, surveyor, auctioneer).
- Enhancement expenditure reflected in the state of the asset at disposal — **routine repairs and revenue expenditure are NOT allowable**.
- Incidental costs of disposal (solicitor, auctioneer, advertising, valuation).
- Costs of establishing, preserving, or defending title to the asset.

### 3.5 Connected persons rule (TCA s. 549)

Where the disposal is between connected persons (spouses, relatives, group companies, partners), the transaction is deemed to be at **market value**, regardless of the stated consideration. Spousal transfers in particular are normally on a **no-gain/no-loss** basis (TCA s. 1028) provided both spouses are resident.

### 3.6 Capital losses (TCA s. 31, s. 546)

- Capital losses are **ring-fenced** — they may be set against current-year capital gains only, not against income.
- Losses unused in the current year may be **carried forward indefinitely** against future capital gains of the same person.
- Losses on disposals to connected persons are **clogged** — usable only against future gains on disposals to that same connected person.
- Losses cannot be carried back, except on death (TCA s. 573).

## Section 4 — Tier 2 — PPR exemption, Entrepreneur Relief, Retirement Relief, indexation, losses

### 4.1 Principal Private Residence (PPR) relief (TCA s. 604)

Full CGT exemption on the disposal of an individual's **sole or main residence** (including a garden / grounds up to **one acre, excluding the site of the house**) where the property has been occupied as the only or main residence throughout the period of ownership.

**Apportionment.** Where the property was not occupied as the PPR throughout ownership, the gain is apportioned as follows:

Exempt gain = Total gain × (Period of qualifying occupation + Final 12 months) / Total period of ownership

The **last 12 months** of ownership are always treated as qualifying occupation, provided the property has been the PPR at some point.

**Permitted absences** that count as qualifying occupation:

- Any period(s) of absence totalling up to **3 years** for any reason.
- Any period(s) of employment abroad (no time limit).
- Any period(s) of absence up to **4 years** due to work elsewhere in Ireland.

Restrictions to PPR:

- Garden / grounds in excess of one acre — apportionment required.
- Periods where the property was let (other than rent-a-room qualifying letting) — non-qualifying.
- Business use of part of the property — apportionment required.
- Acquired or developed wholly or partly for the purpose of realising a gain — relief may be denied.

### 4.2 Entrepreneur Relief — Section 597AA TCA 1997

A reduced CGT rate of **10%** applies on qualifying disposals of business assets, subject to a **lifetime limit of €1,000,000** (raised from €500,000 by Finance Act 2016, effective 1 January 2017).

**Qualifying conditions:**

- Individual disposing of **chargeable business assets**.
- For shares: must own ≥ **5% of the ordinary share capital** of the qualifying company.
- Held for a continuous period of **at least 3 years** ending on the disposal date.
- Individual must have been a **working director or employee** (devoting ≥ 50% of working time) for the 3 years.
- Qualifying business must be a **trading company** (not investment, dealing in shares, dealing in land/development, certain professional services).

**Mechanics:** Gain on the qualifying disposal is charged at 10% up to the cumulative €1M lifetime cap; the excess (and any non-qualifying disposals) is charged at the standard 33% rate.

### 4.3 Retirement Relief — Sections 598 & 599 TCA 1997

Despite the name, the taxpayer does not need to retire — the relief applies on disposals of qualifying business or farming assets by individuals **aged 55 or over**.

**Common conditions:**

- Individual aged **≥ 55** at the date of disposal.
- Disposal of **qualifying business assets** or shares in a **qualifying family company** where the individual was a working director for ≥ 10 years (and full-time working director for ≥ 5 years).
- The assets / shares must have been **owned for ≥ 10 years**.
- For farms, the land must have been **owned and farmed** for ≥ 10 years.

**Two strands:**

- **TCA s. 598 — disposals to third parties (outside the family):**
  • Full relief where aggregate consideration ≤ €750,000 (reduced to €500,000 if the individual is aged 66 or over).
  • Marginal relief tapered above the threshold.

- **TCA s. 599 — disposals to a child (or qualifying nephew/niece):**
  • Full relief on transfers to a child where the disponer is aged 55–65, with **no upper consideration limit historically**, BUT a cap of **€3M** applies where the disponer is aged 66 or over (Finance Act 2014).
  • "Child" includes a foster child meeting statutory conditions, and certain nephews/nieces working in the business.

Clawback of relief may arise where the child disposes of the asset within **6 years**.

### 4.4 Indexation relief (TCA s. 556) — largely abolished

Indexation relief allows the acquisition cost (and pre-2003 enhancement expenditure) of an asset to be uplifted by reference to inflation between the year of acquisition and the year of disposal.

**Key restrictions:**

- **Indexation is frozen at 2003 values.** No indexation factor accrues for any period after 31 December 2002.
- For assets **acquired on or after 1 January 2003**, **no indexation is available**.
- For assets acquired on or before 31 December 2002, the indexation factor is the statutory multiplier published by Revenue for the year of acquisition, applied to the cost and to any enhancement expenditure incurred up to 31 December 2002.

Practical consequence: indexation is encountered only on legacy holdings (typically pre-2003 property or shares).

### 4.5 Losses (TCA s. 31, s. 546, s. 573)

- Current-year losses set against current-year gains before the annual exemption.
- Unused losses carried forward indefinitely.
- Losses on disposals to connected persons clogged.
- Losses on the disposal of development land restricted (development-land regime).
- Losses on death — unused losses cannot be transferred to the estate, but losses incurred in the year of death may be carried back up to 3 years (TCA s. 573).

### 4.6 Other reliefs in scope

- **Annual exemption** — €1,270 per individual per tax year, non-transferable between spouses.
- **Spousal transfer** — no gain / no loss (TCA s. 1028).
- **Disposal of a site to a child** for the construction of the child's PPR — exempt up to market value of €500,000 (TCA s. 603A).
- **Wasting chattels** (life ≤ 50 years) — exempt under TCA s. 603 (subject to business-use carve-out).
- **Government securities, certain life policies, certain pension lump sums** — exempt.

### 4.7 CG50 clearance — TCA s. 980

Where the consideration on a disposal **exceeds €500,000** for **land, buildings, mineral rights, exploration rights, unquoted shares deriving the greater part of their value from Irish land/minerals, or goodwill of a trade in Ireland**, the **purchaser** is obliged to **withhold 15%** of the consideration and remit it to Revenue on account of the vendor's CGT liability — UNLESS the vendor produces a **CG50A clearance certificate**.

For disposals of residential property, the threshold is **€1,000,000** (TCA s. 980(8)).

A CG50A is issued by Revenue on application (Form CG50) by the vendor where the vendor is either Irish-resident, has no outstanding CGT liability, or has paid (or made arrangements to pay) the CGT on the disposal.

Without the CG50A, the buyer's withheld 15% is credited against the vendor's final CGT bill — but creates a cashflow drag and reflects poorly on conveyancing practice.

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### Example A — Disposal of Euronext Dublin (ISEQ) listed shares

**Facts.** Mr Ó Briain, an Irish resident individual, disposed of 5,000 shares in an Irish PLC listed on Euronext Dublin on 12 May 2025. He had acquired them in two tranches: 3,000 shares in June 2018 for €18,000 and 2,000 shares in February 2021 for €22,000. Proceeds on disposal were €75,000 (broker net of commission). No other share disposals during 2025. No capital losses brought forward.

**FIFO identification (TCA s. 581):** the 3,000 June 2018 shares are deemed disposed of first, then 2,000 of the February 2021 holding.

| Line item | Amount (€) |
|---|---|
| Disposal proceeds | 75,000 |
| Less: Cost of 3,000 shares (June 2018) | (18,000) |
| Less: Cost of 2,000 shares (Feb 2021) | (22,000) |
| **Chargeable gain (gross)** | **35,000** |
| Less: Annual exemption | (1,270) |
| **Taxable amount** | **33,730** |
| CGT at 33% | **11,131** |

No indexation (post-2003 acquisitions). Mr Ó Briain reports the disposal on Form CG1 (or via Form 11 if otherwise self-assessed).

### Example B — Sale of family home with periods of letting (PPR partial)

**Facts.** Ms Ní Mhurchú purchased her family home in Galway in January 2008 for €280,000 (plus €5,000 incidental costs). She lived there as her PPR until December 2018. From January 2019 to December 2023 she let the property while working in Dublin (she rented a flat there). She moved back to the Galway property in January 2024 and sold it on 30 November 2025 for €490,000 (€10,000 incidental costs of disposal).

| Period | Months | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Jan 2008 – Dec 2018 | 132 | PPR — qualifying |
| Jan 2019 – Dec 2023 | 60 | Let — non-qualifying (4-year work-elsewhere-in-Ireland absence relief covers 48 months; final 12 months count as final-period; net non-qualifying = 60 − 48 = 12 months, then offset by the always-qualifying final-12-months at the end of ownership — but the final-12-months rule applies only to the LAST 12 months of ownership) |
| Jan 2024 – Nov 2025 | 23 | PPR — qualifying |
| **Total ownership** | **215** | |

Apportionment of qualifying months:

- PPR occupation: 132 + 23 = 155 months.
- Plus permitted absence (work elsewhere in Ireland, up to 4 years): 48 months.
- Plus final 12 months (already included within the qualifying-occupation count for the closing period — DO NOT double count).
- Total qualifying months: 155 + 48 = 203 months.
- Non-qualifying months: 215 − 203 = 12 months.

| Line item | Amount (€) |
|---|---|
| Disposal proceeds | 490,000 |
| Less: Incidental costs of disposal | (10,000) |
| Less: Acquisition cost + incidental | (285,000) |
| **Total gain** | **195,000** |
| Apportioned non-qualifying (195,000 × 12/215) | 10,884 |
| Less: Annual exemption | (1,270) |
| **Taxable amount** | **9,614** |
| CGT at 33% | **3,173** |

The disposal of €490,000 is below the €1,000,000 CG50 threshold for residential property, so no CG50 clearance / 15% withholding applies.

### Example C — Entrepreneur disposal of trading company shares

**Facts.** Ms de Paor, aged 47, founded an Irish trading company in 2018 and held 100% of the ordinary share capital. She was a full-time working director throughout. On 1 October 2025 she sold 100% of the shares to an unrelated third party for €1,400,000. Her acquisition cost (initial subscription) was €10,000. She has not previously claimed Entrepreneur Relief.

**Eligibility check (TCA s. 597AA):**

- Holding period > 3 years ✔
- ≥ 5% ordinary share capital ✔
- Working director devoting ≥ 50% of working time for ≥ 3 years ✔
- Qualifying trading company (not investment / dealing in land) ✔
- Lifetime cap not previously used ✔

| Line item | Amount (€) |
|---|---|
| Disposal proceeds | 1,400,000 |
| Less: Acquisition cost | (10,000) |
| **Chargeable gain (gross)** | **1,390,000** |
| Less: Annual exemption | (1,270) |
| **Net chargeable gain** | **1,388,730** |
| Qualifying portion (within €1M Entrepreneur Relief lifetime cap) | 1,000,000 |
| CGT at 10% on qualifying portion | **100,000** |
| Excess portion (over €1M cap) | 388,730 |
| CGT at 33% on excess | **128,281** |
| **Total CGT** | **228,281** |

The disposal exceeds €500,000 (and the asset is unquoted shares of an Irish company deriving value other than primarily from Irish land — confirm whether s. 980 catches this transaction). In practice, where shares derive their value primarily from a Nigerian or other non-land asset, the CG50 regime may not apply. Where the value derives substantially from Irish land/minerals, a CG50A clearance certificate should be obtained.

## Section 6 — Filing & payment

### 6.1 Returns — Form CG1 vs Form 11 / 11S

- **Form CG1** is the standalone CGT return used by taxpayers who are NOT otherwise within the self-assessment ("chargeable persons") regime. It is filed annually for each tax year in which a disposal arose.
- **Form 11 / Form 11S** — self-employed individuals (sole traders, professionals, company directors filing as chargeable persons) include their CGT computation within the annual Form 11 self-assessment return.
- Both forms are filed via the **Revenue Online Service (ROS)** under the mandatory e-filing regime.
- Filing deadline for the annual return: **31 October** following the end of the tax year (with the ROS pay-and-file extension typically to mid-November for ROS users — confirm Revenue's published extended date each year).

### 6.2 Preliminary CGT — pay-and-file under TCA s. 959AO

CGT operates a unique **two-stage payment** model:

- **Initial period — disposals between 1 January and 30 November of the tax year**: preliminary CGT is due by **15 December** of the same tax year.
- **Later period — disposals between 1 December and 31 December of the tax year**: preliminary CGT is due by **31 January** of the following year.
- Any **balance** of CGT (after preliminary payments) is due with the annual return by **31 October** of the year following the tax year.

This is unusual relative to other Irish taxes: CGT must be paid largely within the tax year itself, even before the annual return is filed.

### 6.3 ROS filing & PPSN

- All Irish-resident individual taxpayers should have a PPSN and a ROS account.
- Form CG1 and Form 11 are filed electronically via **ROS** (myAccount route for PAYE-only taxpayers with simple disposals; ROS for full self-assessment).
- Payment via ROS Debit Instruction (RDI), credit card, or single-debit authority.

### 6.4 CG50 / CG50A mechanics

- On any in-scope disposal > €500,000 (land/buildings/mineral rights/relevant shares/goodwill) — or > €1,000,000 for residential property:
  • Vendor applies for **CG50A clearance** via Form **CG50**, lodged with Revenue's CGT clearance unit before completion.
  • If granted, no 15% withholding is required from the buyer.
  • If not produced, the **buyer must withhold 15% of the consideration** and remit it to Revenue using Form **CG50B**; the withholding is credited against the vendor's eventual CGT liability.

### 6.5 Records & retention

- Retain acquisition contracts, valuation evidence, brokerage notes, disposal contracts, and CG50 documentation for **6 years** from the end of the relevant tax year (general Revenue record-retention rule — TCA s. 886).
- For PPR claims, retain evidence of dates of occupation (utility bills, register of electors, correspondence) for the full ownership period.

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown acquisition cost | STOP — cannot compute gain |
| Acquisition by gift or inheritance with no probate / CAT valuation | Obtain probate / market valuation; if unavailable, STOP |
| PPR claimed but property had periods of letting beyond rent-a-room | Apportion conservatively; assume non-qualifying for the let period |
| Garden / grounds > 1 acre | Apportion proportionally; restrict PPR to one-acre site |
| Unclear whether Entrepreneur Relief 5% / 3-year / working-director conditions are met | Assume conditions not met → 33% standard rate |
| Unknown whether prior Retirement Relief lifetime threshold breached | Assume threshold partly used → restrict relief conservatively, request prior claim history |
| Indexation factor for pre-2003 acquisition unclear | Use Revenue's published indexation table for the year of acquisition; if year unclear, STOP |
| Unknown whether parties are connected | Treat as connected → apply market value rule |
| Routine repair vs enhancement expenditure ambiguous | Treat as routine repair → NOT deductible |
| Crypto disposal with multiple lots and pooling unclear | Apply FIFO under TCA s. 581 pooling rules; document the share-identification trail |
| Disposal > €500,000 land/buildings without CG50A | Assume buyer must withhold 15%; advise vendor to apply for CG50A immediately |
| Preliminary CGT payment date borderline (e.g. completion late November vs early December) | Confirm exact disposal date (date of unconditional contract, not completion, under TCA s. 542); err toward earlier payment window |
| Non-resident disposing of an Irish-situs asset | Confirm whether asset falls within s. 29 specified assets; if not specified, assume out of charge but flag for review |
| Cross-border disposal with possible treaty relief | STOP — refer to specialist treaty review |
| Spousal transfer where one spouse is non-resident | Spousal no-gain/no-loss rule may not apply; refer to specialist |
| Loss on disposal to connected person | Treat as clogged; usable only against future gains on disposal to same person |
