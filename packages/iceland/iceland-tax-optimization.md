# Iceland Tax Optimization

## Iceland Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: Skatturinn (Iceland Revenue), KPMG Iceland Tax Facts 2025, PwC Iceland. Figures must agree with `iceland-income-tax.md` / `iceland-social-contributions.md`. NOT yet signed off by an Icelandic tax adviser. Aggressive positions are never advised; every suggestion must be reviewed.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Iceland |
| Currency | ISK |
| Headline lever | ehf company + dividends (20% CIT + 22% dividend) vs self-employment at high progressive labour rates — subject to the reference-salary rule |
| Corporate tax (ehf) | **20%** |
| Dividend / capital income | **22%** |
| Labour income | High progressive PIT + municipal tax (well above the capital rate) |
| Key rule | **reiknað endurgjald** — owner-managers must pay themselves a market reference salary before profit becomes low-taxed capital income |
| Anti-avoidance | Reference-salary rule; substance |

> **The Iceland lever is converting high-taxed labour income into lower-taxed capital income via an ehf** — but the **reiknað endurgjald** rule deliberately limits this: an active owner must first draw a reasonable salary (taxed as labour) before the remainder can be dividends at 22%.

## Section 2 -- ehf Company + Dividend vs Self-Employment

**ehf Company + Dividend vs Self-Employment**

| Route | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| **Self-employed** | Business income taxed as **labour** on the high progressive scale + municipal tax + full social contributions |
| **ehf (private limited)** | 20% CIT on profit; profit extracted as **dividends at 22%** — but only **after** a market reference salary (labour-taxed) |

For higher earners the ehf can lower the overall rate by shifting the surplus (above a fair salary) into 22% capital income and deferring undistributed profit at the 20% corporate rate. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current labour-income brackets and whether retained ehf profit is genuinely deferred.]**

## Section 3 -- The Reference-Salary Rule (reiknað endurgjald) — the key constraint

- **Reference-salary requirement** — Skatturinn publishes minimum reference-salary tables by occupation. An owner-manager who actively works in their ehf (or as self-employed) must declare at least that reference salary as labour income; you cannot take everything as 22% dividends to dodge labour tax.  _(Skatturinn)_

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT.** Under-declaring the owner salary below the reference tables is a primary Skatturinn audit target. Set the salary at/above the published reference for the occupation and document it.

## Section 4 -- Deductions & Reliefs

**Deductions & Reliefs**

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Personal tax credit (persónuafsláttur) | A fixed annual credit reduces tax for every resident — ensure fully used. |
| Pension contributions | Mandatory occupational pension + deductible additional (private) pension contributions up to a cap. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the deductible private-pension percentage.]** |
| Business expenses | Genuine costs deductible (self-employed / ehf). |
| Inter-company dividends | Dividends between resident limited companies are not subject to the 22% WHT — relevant for holding structures. |

## Section 5 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Reference salary red line** — Never set an active owner's salary below the published occupational reference to convert labour into capital income.
- **Substance requirement** — The ehf must carry on genuine business.
- **Mislabelling private spending** — Mislabelling private spending as company expense creates taxable benefits, not deductions.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Prohibition 1** — NEVER advise an active owner to take a salary below the Skatturinn reference tables to maximise 22% dividends.
- **Prohibition 2** — NEVER present the ehf route as avoiding labour tax entirely — the reference salary is labour-taxed.
- **Prohibition 3** — NEVER contradict the rates in `iceland-income-tax.md` / `iceland-social-contributions.md`.
- **Prohibition 4** — NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Icelandic tax adviser.
