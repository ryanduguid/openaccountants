### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Client asks about income tax | State clearly: there is no personal income tax in the Bahamas |
| Unknown NIB registration status | STOP -- instruct client to register with NIB if self-employed and not yet registered |
| Unknown business turnover (VAT threshold) | Assume VAT registration required; escalate to confirm |
| Unknown property ownership | Skip RPT section; note it for reviewer |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction for Business Licence cost purposes |
| Unknown expense category (Business Licence deductibility) | Not deductible until confirmed |
| Client asks about capital gains on property | No CGT in Bahamas; stamp duty applies on conveyance |

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- client's employment status (employed / self-employed / both), approximate annual earnings or turnover, and confirmation they are resident in or operating from the Bahamas.

**Recommended** -- NIB registration number (nine-digit), whether a Business Licence has been obtained, VAT registration status and number if applicable, property ownership details for RPT, any recent real estate transactions for stamp duty.

**Ideal** -- NIB Smart Card, Business Licence certificate, VAT registration certificate, DIR taxpayer file number, complete annual turnover figure, payroll records (for employers), bank statements for the full year.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** If employment status is unknown, issue a hard stop: "Employment and self-employment status is required to determine NIB contribution rates and obligations. Please confirm before proceeding."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-BS-1** — "The Bahamas levies no personal income tax. There is no tax return to file, no income to declare to a tax authority, and no income tax due. If you are asking about social contributions, see the NIB section. If you are a business paying corporate tax, this skill does not cover corporate tax -- escalate to a qualified Bahamian practitioner." (Client asks for a personal income tax computation.)
- **R-BS-2** — "The Bahamas has no capital gains tax. If you are selling real estate, stamp duty applies on the conveyance -- see Section 6. If you are selling securities, no transfer taxes apply." (Capital gains computation requested.)
- **R-BS-3** — "There is no inheritance, estate, or gift tax in the Bahamas. Estate planning and probate costs are legal/probate fees, not taxes. Escalate to a Bahamian attorney for estate planning." (Inheritance or estate planning.)
- **R-BS-4** — "This skill covers individuals and self-employed sole traders only. The Bahamas does not impose corporate income tax on profits, but companies face Business Licence fees, VAT registration obligations, and payroll NIB obligations. Escalate to a qualified Bahamian practitioner for company compliance." (Corporate / company tax.)
- **R-BS-5** — "Non-residents and expatriates face the same absence of income tax. However, work permit requirements, specific benefit-in-kind rules, and social security totalization agreements may apply. For complex expatriate situations, escalate to a Bahamian HR compliance specialist." (Non-resident / expatriate complex situations.)
- **R-BS-6** — "Client has outstanding NIB contributions, surcharges, or is subject to NIB enforcement. The 10% surcharge plus 1.5% compound monthly interest accumulates rapidly. Do not advise. Escalate to a Bahamian accountant or NIB-registered agent immediately." (NIB arrears or enforcement.)
- **R-BS-7** — "From July 2025, businesses with less than 50% zero or reduced-rated supplies cannot claim VAT refunds. Escalate to a DIR-registered VAT practitioner." (VAT refund claims.)  _(Higgs & Johnson 2025 Tax Legislative Updates)_

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement lines. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. NIB obligations are the primary personal tax cost in the Bahamas; VAT is relevant only if the client is VAT-registered.

### Example 1 -- Employed Individual, Annual Salary BSD 45,000

**Scenario:** Maria is employed full-time at a Nassau hotel. Annual salary BSD 45,000.

**Step 1 -- Personal income tax:** BSD 0. No personal income tax exists in the Bahamas.

**Step 2 -- NIB contributions:**
- Weekly salary: 45,000 ÷ 52 = BSD 865.38 -- ABOVE the weekly ceiling of BSD 810
- Insurable wage = ceiling: BSD 810/week
- Employee NIB: 4.65% × BSD 810 = BSD 37.67/week × 52 = **BSD 1,958/year**
- Employer NIB: 6.65% × BSD 810 = BSD 53.87/week × 52 = **BSD 2,801/year**
- Take-home: BSD 45,000 − BSD 1,958 = **BSD 43,042/year** (no income tax deducted)

**Step 3 -- No other obligations:** No Business Licence (employed). No VAT (not in business). No income tax return to file.

**Summary:**
```
Annual salary:            BSD 45,000
Less: Employee NIB:       BSD (1,958)
Net take-home:            BSD 43,042
Income tax:               BSD 0
```

### Example 2 -- Self-Employed Freelancer, Annual Revenue BSD 30,000

**Scenario:** James is a self-employed web developer. Annual revenue BSD 30,000. Below VAT threshold.

**Step 1 -- Personal income tax:** BSD 0.

**Step 2 -- NIB contributions (self-employed rate 10.30%):**
- Weekly earnings: 30,000 ÷ 52 = BSD 576.92/week -- BELOW the ceiling of BSD 810
- Insurable wage = actual earnings: BSD 576.92/week
- Annual NIB: 10.30% × BSD 30,000 = **BSD 3,090/year**
- Monthly NIB payment (due 15th of following month): 3,090 ÷ 12 = **BSD 257.50/month**

**Step 3 -- Business Licence:**
- Turnover ≤ BSD 50,000: flat fee **BSD 100**
- Renewal filing by 31 January; payment by 31 March

**Step 4 -- VAT:** BSD 30,000 < BSD 100,000 threshold. **No VAT registration required** (voluntary registration available).

**Step 5 -- No RPT** (renting; does not own property).

**Summary:**
```
Annual revenue:           BSD 30,000
NIB (10.30%):             BSD (3,090)
Business Licence fee:     BSD (100)
Income tax:               BSD 0
Approximate net:          BSD 26,810
```

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed at NIB Ceiling, BSD 60,000 Revenue

**Scenario:** Sandra is a self-employed accountant, revenue BSD 60,000/year.

**Step 1 -- Personal income tax:** BSD 0.

**Step 2 -- NIB contributions:**
- Weekly earnings: 60,000 ÷ 52 = BSD 1,153.85/week -- ABOVE ceiling of BSD 810
- Insurable wage = ceiling: BSD 810/week
- Annual NIB: 10.30% × BSD 810 × 52 = 10.30% × BSD 42,120 = **BSD 4,338/year**
- Earnings above ceiling (BSD 1,153.85 − BSD 810 = BSD 343.85/week) attract NO additional NIB

**Step 3 -- Business Licence:**
- Turnover BSD 60,000 (in band BSD 50,001 -- BSD 500,000): 0.50% × BSD 60,000 = **BSD 300**

**Step 4 -- VAT:** BSD 60,000 < BSD 100,000 threshold. Not required; may register voluntarily.

**Summary:**
```
Annual revenue:           BSD 60,000
NIB (at ceiling):         BSD (4,338)
Business Licence fee:     BSD (300)
Income tax:               BSD 0
Approximate net:          BSD 55,362
```

### Example 4 -- VAT-Registered Consultant, BSD 180,000 Revenue

**Scenario:** David is a self-employed management consultant, revenue BSD 180,000/year including VAT charged at 10%. VAT registered.

**Step 1 -- Revenue (net of VAT):**
- BSD 180,000 includes 10% VAT. Net revenue = BSD 180,000 ÷ 1.10 = **BSD 163,636**
- VAT collected = BSD 163,636 × 10% = BSD 16,364 (liability to DIR, not income)

**Step 2 -- Personal income tax:** BSD 0.

**Step 3 -- NIB:**
- Weekly net earnings: 163,636 ÷ 52 = BSD 3,146 -- ABOVE ceiling
- NIB = 10.30% × BSD 810 × 52 = **BSD 4,338/year**

**Step 4 -- Business Licence:**
- Turnover BSD 163,636 (band BSD 50,001 -- BSD 500,000): 0.50% × BSD 163,636 = **BSD 818**
- Certified turnover statement by accountant required (>BSD 100,000)

**Step 5 -- VAT obligations:**
- Quarterly VAT return (turnover ≤ BSD 5M)
- Due within 21 days of end of each quarter
- Pay net VAT (output VAT collected minus input VAT on business purchases)

**Summary:**
```
Gross revenue invoiced:   BSD 180,000
Less: VAT collected:      BSD (16,364)
Net business revenue:     BSD 163,636
NIB (at ceiling):         BSD (4,338)
Business Licence fee:     BSD (818)
Income tax:               BSD 0
```

### Example 5 -- Property Purchase, Stamp Duty Calculation

**Scenario:** Nicole purchases a residential property in Nassau for BSD 250,000.

**Step 1 -- Personal income tax on transaction:** BSD 0.

**Step 2 -- Stamp duty (graduated, shared 50/50 buyer/seller by default):**
- First BSD 20,000 at 4%: BSD 20,000 × 4% = BSD 800
- Next BSD 30,000 (BSD 20,001 -- BSD 50,000) at 6%: BSD 30,000 × 6% = BSD 1,800
- Next BSD 50,000 (BSD 50,001 -- BSD 100,000) at 8%: BSD 50,000 × 8% = BSD 4,000
- Remaining BSD 150,000 (above BSD 100,000) at 10%: BSD 150,000 × 10% = BSD 15,000
- **Total stamp duty: BSD 21,600**
- Nicole's share (buyer, 50%): **BSD 10,800**
- Seller's share (50%): **BSD 10,800**

*Arithmetic check: 800 + 1,800 + 4,000 + 15,000 = BSD 21,600 ✓*

**Step 3 -- First-time buyer exemption:** If Nicole is a first-time buyer purchasing a dwelling up to BSD 500,000, she is **exempt** from stamp duty. (Source: Churchill & Jones Realty stamp duty guide)

**Step 4 -- VAT provisional invoice (from July 2025):** Before executing conveyance, parties must obtain a provisional VAT invoice from DIR. (Source: Higgs & Johnson 2025 Tax Legislative Updates)

**Step 5 -- Payment deadline:** Stamp duty due **within 6 months** of transaction closing.

### Example 6 -- Employer Payroll NIB (3 Employees)

**Scenario:** Small business with 3 employees, all earning BSD 600/week.

**NIB per employee per week:**
- Employee share: 4.65% × BSD 600 = BSD 27.90
- Employer share: 6.65% × BSD 600 = BSD 39.90
- Combined per employee: BSD 67.80/week

**NIB for all 3 employees per month (≈4.333 weeks):**
- Total employee NIB: BSD 27.90 × 3 × 4.333 = BSD 362.95/month
- Total employer NIB: BSD 39.90 × 3 × 4.333 = BSD 518.74/month
- **Total monthly NIB (C10 form): BSD 881.70**
- Due: **15th of the following month** via C10 form

*BSD 600/week is below the BSD 810 ceiling, so full earnings are insurable. Arithmetic: 27.90 + 39.90 = BSD 67.80/employee/week. 67.80 × 3 = 203.40/week × 4.333 = BSD 881.51 ≈ BSD 882/month ✓*

### 5.1 The Fundamental Rule -- No Personal Income Tax

- **No personal income tax legislation** — There is no personal income tax legislation in the Bahamas. No individual is required to: File an annual income tax return with any authority; Declare employment or self-employment income to a tax collector; Pay tax on salary, professional fees, rental income, dividends, interest, or capital gains. The primary fiscal obligation for individuals is NIB contributions, which are social insurance premiums, not income tax.

### 5.2 NIB Contribution Calculation Rules

- **Employed individuals calculation steps** — 1. Determine weekly insurable wage: the lower of (a) actual weekly gross earnings or (b) the weekly ceiling (currently BSD 810). 2. Employee share: insurable wage × 4.65%. 3. Employer share: insurable wage × 6.65%. 4. Employer remits both shares monthly via C10 form by the 15th of the following month.
- **Self-employed individuals calculation steps** — 1. Determine weekly insurable earnings: the lower of (a) actual weekly net self-employment earnings or (b) the weekly ceiling (BSD 810). 2. Self-employed rate: insurable earnings × 10.30% (covers both employee and employer shares). 3. Register using Form R1 within 10 working days of commencing self-employment. 4. Pay monthly by the 15th of the following month.  _(nib-bahamas.com/Registration)_
- **Earnings above the weekly ceiling** — No NIB is payable on earnings above BSD 810/week. The ceiling applies per week, not per year.

### 5.3 NIB Benefits Funded by Contributions

(Source: nib-bahamas.com/about-nib/benefits-and-assistance/)

Ten cash benefits are funded: Sickness, Maternity, Funeral, Retirement (Pensions), Invalidity, Survivorship, Unemployment, Industrial Injury, Disablement, and Death.

### 5.4 VAT: When It Applies to Individuals

- **VAT applicability** — VAT is relevant to individuals only if they are carrying on a business (self-employed, sole trader). Pure employees have no VAT obligation.
- **VAT registration threshold** — BSD 100,000 in annual taxable supplies. Must register within 14 days of becoming liable.  _(inlandrevenue.finance.gov.bs/value-added-tax/faqs/)_
- **Filing and payment** — General (turnover ≤ BSD 5M): quarterly return, due 21 days after end of quarter. Large taxpayer (turnover > BSD 5M): monthly return, due 14 days after end of month. E-commerce businesses, hotels, and vacation rental services: must register regardless of turnover.
- **Record-keeping** — Maintain accounting records for at least 5 years.  _(Inland Revenue VAT FAQs)_

### 5.5 Business Licence: Who Needs One

### 5.7 Stamp Duty on Real Estate Conveyances

**Stamp Duty on Real Estate Conveyances**  _(Churchill & Jones Realty stamp duty guide; Higgs & Johnson 2025 Tax Legislative Updates)_

| Consideration | Stamp duty rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to BSD 20,000 | 4% |
| BSD 20,001 -- BSD 50,000 | 6% |
| BSD 50,001 -- BSD 100,000 | 8% |
| Above BSD 100,000 | 10% |

- **Split, exemption, and deadlines** — Normally split equally (50/50) between buyer and seller unless otherwise agreed. First-time buyer exemption: Exempt on a dwelling house or vacant land for a dwelling up to BSD 500,000. Stamp duty on mortgage instruments: approximately 1% of mortgage amount [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact current rate]. Leases < 5 years: 2.5% of annual rent. Payment deadline: within 6 months of transaction closing. From 1 July 2025: Parties must obtain a provisional VAT invoice from DIR before executing conveyance instruments. Failure: 3% of consideration penalty (joint and several: transferor + agent).  _(Higgs & Johnson 2025 Tax Legislative Updates)_

### 5.8 Non-Deductible Items

**Non-Deductible Items**

| Item | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment, client meals | Personal/entertainment; not wholly for business |
| Owner drawings | Not an expense |
| NIB surcharges and penalties | Penalties are not operating costs |
| Business Licence late penalties | Penalties |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Court fines, traffic violations | Public policy |
| Income tax payments | There is no income tax; if a payment is seen, verify its nature |

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction (Business Licence Cost Basis)

There is no income tax deduction system in the Bahamas, but Business Licence fees are based on turnover (not profit), so home-office cost allocation is relevant for understanding profitability rather than for reducing a declared tax base.

For VAT-registered clients, the business-use proportion of home utilities may affect which input VAT is creditable.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm whether client's business address is home or commercial, and confirm what proportion of home expenses are genuinely attributable to the business. The Bahamas has no statutory guidance on this proportion -- reviewer must apply judgment.

**Conservative default:** 0% home office allocation until reviewer confirms.

### 6.2 Vehicle Business Use

Relevant for VAT input tax recovery (if VAT-registered) and for understanding true business costs.

- Client must document approximate business vs personal mileage
- No statutory mileage rate exists in the Bahamas [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm any DIR guidance]

**Conservative default:** 0% business use until confirmed.

### 6.3 NIB Contribution Status Verification

Before advising a client, confirm:
- Are they registered with NIB? (nine-digit NIB number assigned on registration)
- Are contributions current? (check with NIB directly)
- Is the client voluntarily insured (if not employed or self-employed in the traditional sense)?

Arrears with NIB accumulate rapidly (10% surcharge + 1.5%/month compound). If arrears are suspected, escalate immediately.

### 6.4 VAT Input Tax Apportionment (Mixed-Use Businesses)

If a VAT-registered business makes both taxable and exempt supplies, input VAT must be apportioned. Partial exemption calculation:

- Standard method: proportion of taxable to total supplies (by value)
- From July 2025: businesses with < 50% zero/reduced-rated supplies cannot claim VAT refunds (Source: Higgs & Johnson 2025)

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm supply mix and apportionment method for VAT-registered clients with exempt supplies.

### 6.5 Real Property Tax Assessment Disputes

The assessed value (used for RPT rate bands) is set by DIR and may differ from market value. A property owner may dispute the assessment.

**Flag for reviewer:** If client believes assessed value is overstated, escalate to a Bahamian real property attorney or appraiser before filing.

### 6.6 Business Licence Turnover Definition

The turnover figure used for Business Licence purposes is gross revenue (not net profit, not value-added). For VAT-registered businesses, confirm whether turnover is inclusive or exclusive of VAT for Business Licence computation purposes. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm whether DIR uses gross or VAT-exclusive turnover for Business Licence rate band computation]

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee, salary at ceiling.**
Input: Employed, weekly salary BSD 950 (above BSD 810 ceiling).
Expected: Insurable wage = BSD 810/week. Employee NIB = 4.65% × BSD 810 = BSD 37.67/week = BSD 1,958/year. No income tax. Take-home ≈ BSD 950 × 52 − BSD 1,958 = BSD 49,400 − BSD 1,958 = BSD 47,442/year.

**Test 2 -- Employee, salary below ceiling.**
Input: Employed, weekly salary BSD 500 (below BSD 810 ceiling).
Expected: Insurable wage = BSD 500/week. Employee NIB = 4.65% × BSD 500 = BSD 23.25/week = BSD 1,209/year. Employer NIB = 6.65% × BSD 500 = BSD 33.25/week = BSD 1,729/year. No income tax.

**Test 3 -- Self-employed, below ceiling.**
Input: Self-employed, annual net earnings BSD 25,000.
Expected: Weekly = BSD 480.77 (below BSD 810). Annual NIB = 10.30% × BSD 25,000 = BSD 2,575. Monthly payment = BSD 214.58. Business Licence: BSD 100 flat (below BSD 50k). No income tax.

**Test 4 -- Self-employed, above ceiling.**
Input: Self-employed, annual net earnings BSD 100,000.
Expected: Weekly = BSD 1,923 (above BSD 810). Insurable = BSD 810/week. Annual NIB = 10.30% × BSD 810 × 52 = BSD 4,338. Business Licence: 0.50% × BSD 100,000 = BSD 500. No income tax.

**Test 5 -- VAT registration threshold.**
Input: Self-employed, annual taxable supplies BSD 95,000.
Expected: Below BSD 100,000 threshold. VAT registration NOT required (but voluntary registration available). No VAT return to file.

**Test 6 -- Stamp duty, first-time buyer.**
Input: First-time buyer, purchasing a dwelling for BSD 400,000.
Expected: Normally stamp duty would be: BSD 800 (first BSD 20k) + BSD 1,800 (next BSD 30k) + BSD 4,000 (next BSD 50k) + BSD 30,000 (remaining BSD 300k at 10%) = BSD 36,600 total. BUT first-time buyer exemption applies (dwelling ≤ BSD 500k). Stamp duty = BSD 0.

**Test 7 -- Stamp duty, non-exempt buyer.**
Input: Second-property buyer, purchasing for BSD 75,000.
Expected: BSD 800 (4% × 20k) + BSD 1,800 (6% × 30k) + BSD 2,000 (8% × 25k) = BSD 4,600 total. Split equally: each party pays BSD 2,300.
*Arithmetic check: 20,000 × 4% = 800; 30,000 × 6% = 1,800; 25,000 × 8% = 2,000. Sum = BSD 4,600. Each party BSD 2,300 ✓*

**Test 8 -- No income tax return.**
Input: Any individual (employed or self-employed) asks if they need to file an income tax return in the Bahamas.
Expected: No. There is no personal income tax and no tax return to file. The only individual compliance obligations are NIB (social contributions), Business Licence (if in business), and VAT (if turnover ≥ BSD 100,000).

**Test 9 -- Employer NIB (C10 Form).**
Input: Employer with 2 employees, each earning BSD 700/week.
Expected: BSD 700 < BSD 810 ceiling; full earnings are insurable. Per employee/week: employee 4.65% × 700 = BSD 32.55; employer 6.65% × 700 = BSD 46.55. Combined per employee: BSD 79.10/week. For 2 employees monthly ≈ BSD 79.10 × 2 × 4.333 = BSD 685.78 ≈ BSD 686/month. Due 15th of following month via C10 form.

**Test 10 -- RPT, owner-occupied property.**
Input: Owner-occupied residential property, assessed value BSD 450,000.
Expected: First BSD 300,000 exempt. Next BSD 150,000 at 0.625%: BSD 150,000 × 0.625% = BSD 937.50. Total RPT = BSD 937.50. If paid by 31 March: 10% early-payment discount = BSD 93.75 saving; net BSD 843.75.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute, estimate, or imply that the Bahamas levies personal income tax on individuals
- NEVER generate an income tax return or income declaration form for a Bahamian individual
- NEVER confuse NIB contributions (social insurance) with income tax -- they are separate systems with separate authorities
- NEVER skip NIB compliance guidance -- it is the primary individual tax obligation and penalties accumulate rapidly
- NEVER advise a self-employed client to start business without first addressing Business Licence and NIB registration
- NEVER allow entertainment expenses as deductible without reviewer confirmation
- NEVER omit the provisional VAT invoice warning for real estate transactions (required from July 2025)
- NEVER present these computations as definitive without reviewer sign-off -- always label as estimated
- NEVER confuse BSD (Bahamian Dollar) with a different currency -- it is pegged 1:1 to USD
- NEVER apply a stamp duty first-time buyer exemption without confirming it is a dwelling (not commercial) and consideration ≤ BSD 500,000
