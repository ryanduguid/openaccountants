# New Jersey Corporation Business Tax (CBT) and Business Alternative Income Tax (BAIT)

CBT 9% on net income (graduated 6.5%/7.5%/9% by bracket) plus the 2.5% Corporate Transit Fee surtax on entities with allocated net income above $10M (effective tax periods ending on or after July 1, 2024 and running five years), producing an 11.5% top marginal rate, the highest C-corp rate in the United States. Single sales factor with market-based sourcing of services to the customer's NJ location, mandatory water's-edge unitary combined returns over 50% common ownership, 95% GILTI deduction, 20-year PNOL pool. BAIT PTET election graduated 5.675% to 10.9%, Form CBT-100 and Form PTE-K1 owner credit. Tax year 2025.

## 1. Scope and overview

This skill covers two distinct New Jersey business taxes:

1. **Corporation Business Tax (CBT)** — N.J.S.A. 54:10A-1 et seq. Imposed on every domestic corporation and every foreign corporation deriving receipts from sources in New Jersey, exercising its corporate franchise in New Jersey, or doing business, employing or owning capital or property, or maintaining an office in New Jersey. Applies to C-corporations and to S-corporations electing to be treated as C-corps for New Jersey purposes (since 2022, federal S election is automatically respected for NJ unless the entity affirmatively elects otherwise — see N.J.S.A. 54:10A-5.22).

2. **Business Alternative Income Tax (BAIT)** — P.L. 2019 c. 320 (Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax Act), substantially amended by P.L. 2021 c. 419 (effective tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2022). An elective pass-through entity tax ("PTET") at the entity level that generates a refundable credit at the owner level, designed as a workaround to the federal $10,000 SALT cap under IRC §164(b)(6).

The skill is in scope for:

- New Jersey C-corporations and their multistate groups filing CBT-100 or CBT-100U.
- New Jersey partnerships, LLCs taxed as partnerships, and federal S-corporations considering or making the BAIT election on Form PTE-100.
- Owners of pass-through entities that have elected BAIT, claiming the refundable credit on Form NJ-BUS-1 / PTE-K1.

Out of scope (will refuse and route):

- NJ Gross Income Tax (GIT) individual returns — covered by a separate `nj-gross-income-tax` skill. This skill references GIT only where it interacts with BAIT (owner credit and resident credit for taxes paid to other states).
- Insurance Premiums Tax, Banking and Financial Business Tax under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-34 et seq. (different rate structure), Public Utility Franchise Tax, Petroleum Products Gross Receipts Tax.
- NJ Sales and Use Tax — separate skill.
- Pre-2018 CBT periods (pre-federal-tax-reform, pre-combined-reporting era).
- CBT-100S (S-corporation specific form, pre-2022 mechanics) — post-2022 S-corps generally do not file CBT-100S since the federal S election is automatically respected unless reversed.

## 2. CBT rates and brackets (tax year 2025)

New Jersey is one of the few states that imposes a graduated corporate income tax rate structure. Per N.J.S.A. 54:10A-5(c):

| Allocated NJ entire net income | Marginal CBT rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $50,000 | 6.5% |
| $50,001 – $100,000 | 7.5% |
| Over $100,000 | 9.0% |

Important: this is a "cliff" structure operationalized through the form. The 6.5% and 7.5% reduced rates apply only when the taxpayer's **entire net income** (allocated to NJ — i.e., post-apportionment, post-NOL) is at or below the bracket ceiling. A taxpayer with $100,001 in allocated entire net income pays 9% on all $100,001, not just the dollar above $100,000. There is no rate "smoothing" through marginal calculation: the brackets work like an alternative minimum-tax-style step function. (Form CBT-100 line instructions clarify this — taxpayers select the rate band based on total allocated ENI and apply that single rate.) For multistate groups, the determination is made at the entity / member level on allocated NJ net income, not on worldwide income.

S-corporations that have not affirmatively elected to be taxed as C-corps for NJ purposes (post-P.L. 2022 c. 133) flow through to shareholders for GIT purposes, but the S-corp itself still files an informational CBT-100S in some cases and pays a minimum tax (see §4).

## 3. Corporate Transit Fee — the 2.5% surtax (critical 2024–2029 issue)

### 3.1 History — the original temporary surtax (2018–2023)

The "temporary CBT surtax" was enacted by P.L. 2018 c. 48 at 2.5% on allocated entire net income above $1 million for privilege periods ending July 31, 2018 through December 31, 2019, then reduced to 1.5% for periods ending in 2020–2021, then partially extended at 2.5% under P.L. 2020 c. 95 through privilege periods ending December 31, 2023. The original surtax **expired** for privilege periods ending on or after January 1, 2024, reducing the top NJ effective rate temporarily back to 9%.

### 3.2 The Corporate Transit Fee — reinstated under the FY2025 budget (P.L. 2024 c. 22)

P.L. 2024 c. 22 (signed June 28, 2024, as part of the FY2025 budget package) created the **Corporate Transit Fee** at N.J.S.A. 54:10A-5.41. Key parameters:

- **Rate:** 2.5%.
- **Base:** allocated taxable net income exceeding **$10 million** (the higher $10M threshold replaces the prior $1M threshold of the expired temporary surtax — this is the legislative compromise that targets only the very largest filers).
- **Effective dates:** privilege periods ending on or after **July 1, 2024**, through privilege periods ending before **January 1, 2029** (a five-year sunset, though prior NJ history suggests possible extension).
- **Combined groups:** applied at the combined group level on allocated NJ taxable net income of the group, then allocated proportionally among taxable members per N.J.S.A. 54:10A-4.6 ordering rules.
- **Calculation base:** taxable net income **after** apportionment but **before** application of net operating loss carryovers (PNOLs) and before dividend exclusions — this is the distinction from the regular CBT rate base. The Division of Taxation has been explicit that the Transit Fee base does not benefit from PNOLs in the way the regular rate base does, but it does come after apportionment.
- **Dedication:** revenues are statutorily dedicated to NJ Transit operations (hence "Corporate Transit Fee" branding rather than "surtax").

### 3.3 Effective top rate

For a calendar-year filer in 2025 with NJ allocated entire net income above $10M:

- Regular CBT: 9.0%
- Corporate Transit Fee: 2.5%
- **Combined effective rate: 11.5%**

This is the highest corporate income tax rate in the United States for tax year 2025, exceeding Minnesota (9.8%), Illinois (9.5% incl. PPRT), and Pennsylvania (which is on a declining schedule). Reviewer must remember that this rate applies only to the portion of allocated taxable net income above $10M; the first $10M is taxed at the regular 9% (or graduated bracket if income is in the lower bands, which by definition it is not if the $10M threshold is crossed).

### 3.4 Short-period and fiscal-year issues

For non-calendar-year filers, the "tax period ending on or after July 1, 2024" test catches:

- Fiscal years ending July 31, 2024 → full Transit Fee year (caught the first time)
- Fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 → not caught (period ended before July 1, 2024)
- Calendar year 2024 (12/31/2024) → caught (full year despite the law passing mid-year — there is no proration)

Reviewer caution: for the first affected fiscal year, ALL income above $10M for the full 12 months is subject to the Fee, not just the post-July 2024 portion. The Division's TB-103 guidance confirms this no-proration position.

## 4. Minimum tax

Under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-5(e), every CBT taxpayer (including loss filers and S-corps) owes at least the minimum tax based on **New Jersey gross receipts** for the privilege period (not net income):

| NJ gross receipts | Minimum tax |
|---|---|
| Less than $100,000 | $500 |
| $100,000 to under $250,000 | $750 |
| $250,000 to under $500,000 | $1,000 |
| $500,000 to under $1,000,000 | $1,500 |
| $1,000,000 or more | $2,000 |

For members of an affiliated or controlled group with total payroll of $5,000,000 or more, the minimum tax is **$2,000** regardless of the individual member's NJ gross receipts. This catches small NJ subsidiaries of large multinationals.

Combined group filers: each taxable member computes its own minimum tax based on its NJ gross receipts; the combined group's total minimum tax is the sum of member minimum taxes, subject to the $2,000 floor per member where the $5M affiliated group test is met.

Foreign corporations not otherwise subject to CBT but registered to do business in NJ are still liable for the minimum tax.

## 5. Apportionment — single sales factor, market-based sourcing

### 5.1 Single sales factor (effective since 2014, fully phased in 2019)

NJ uses a 100% single sales factor under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-6. Property and payroll factors were phased out and are no longer in the apportionment formula. The factor is:

```
NJ sales factor = NJ receipts / total receipts everywhere
```

### 5.2 Market-based sourcing of services and intangibles

P.L. 2018 c. 48 moved NJ from cost-of-performance sourcing to **market-based sourcing** for service receipts and intangible-property receipts, effective for privilege periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019.

**Services** are sourced to where the customer **receives the benefit** of the service:

- B2B services: typically the customer's office or operating location that benefits from the service. Where the benefit is received in multiple states, allocate based on the customer's use of the service (records of customer locations, contractually agreed delivery points, etc.).
- B2C services: customer's billing or residential address.

**Intangible receipts** (royalties, licenses, franchise fees) are sourced to where the intangible is **used** by the customer.

**Tangible personal property sales**: continue to be sourced to the destination state under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-6(B)(1) (the traditional UDITPA destination test).

### 5.3 Throwout repealed; no throwback

NJ's controversial "throwout" rule (which excluded from the denominator receipts assigned to states where the taxpayer was not taxable) was repealed effective for periods ending after June 30, 2010. NJ has no throwback rule. Receipts sourced to states where the taxpayer has no nexus simply remain in the denominator but not the numerator, reducing the NJ factor.

### 5.4 P.L. 86-272 — narrowed by NJ TB-108 (2023)

NJ adopted the MTC's 2021 P.L. 86-272 reinterpretation through Technical Bulletin TB-108 (December 2022, revised 2023). Out-of-state sellers with NJ customers who engage in any of the following on the seller's website lose P.L. 86-272 immunity and become subject to CBT:

- Post-sale chat or customer support to NJ customers (beyond solicitation)
- Cookies that track NJ customer behavior for non-solicitation purposes
- Online application portals, account login pages, and similar non-solicitation interactions
- Streaming content delivery to NJ users

This is litigation-prone and the reviewer should flag any out-of-state e-commerce or digital-services taxpayer claiming P.L. 86-272 protection for further factual development.

## 6. Mandatory water's-edge unitary combined returns

### 6.1 Combined reporting requirement (since 2019)

P.L. 2018 c. 48 introduced mandatory combined reporting for privilege periods ending on and after July 31, 2019. NJ moved from separate-entity reporting to **water's-edge unitary combined** as the default.

Under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-4.6 through 4.11:

- **Common ownership test:** more than 50% direct or indirect ownership (by vote OR value) of the voting stock by a common owner.
- **Unitary business test:** the businesses must be engaged in a unitary business (functional integration, centralized management, economies of scale — the classic *Mobil Oil* factors as adopted by NJ).
- **Combined group:** all entities meeting both tests must file as a combined group on Form **CBT-100U** with a single "managerial member" designated to file on behalf of the group.

### 6.2 Water's-edge default

The default combined group includes:

- All US members of the unitary business (domestic corps and entities treated as corps).
- Non-US members **only to the extent they have 20% or more of their property, payroll, and sales factors sourced to the US** (the "20% effectively connected" inclusion test), or if they are tax-haven domiciliaries listed by the Division.
- All members are included regardless of whether each individually has NJ nexus — the combined group is the taxable unit.

### 6.3 Alternative elections

The managerial member may elect (binding for 6 years):

- **World-wide combined election:** include all foreign affiliates regardless of US factor presence.
- **Affiliated group election:** include all federal §1504 affiliates (broader than unitary, narrower than worldwide).

Each election locks the group in for 6 privilege periods; the choice is fact-driven and depends on the global effective rate profile.

### 6.4 Mechanics

- Each member computes its own ENI on a separate-company basis using federal taxable income as the starting point, then NJ modifications.
- Intercompany transactions between combined group members are **eliminated** in the combined return.
- The combined group's total ENI is apportioned using a single-sales factor computed at the group level (the so-called "Finnigan" approach — all members' NJ receipts flow into the numerator regardless of whether the individual member has nexus).
- Each taxable member is then allocated its share of the combined NJ tax based on its proportion of group factors.
- The Corporate Transit Fee (§3) is computed at the **group level** then allocated.

### 6.5 PNOLs (Prior Net Operating Losses) — see §8

PNOLs are member-specific assets that survive the transition to combined reporting; they cannot generally be shared across members of the group (with limited exceptions for true successor entities under §381-type events).

## 7. GILTI treatment

NJ partially conforms to the federal GILTI inclusion under IRC §951A, with significant decoupling.

### 7.1 The 95% deduction position

Following P.L. 2020 c. 118 (signed November 4, 2020) and the Division's subsequent guidance (TB-92, TB-93), NJ treats GILTI as follows:

- GILTI is included in NJ entire net income through federal taxable income (the federal starting point).
- NJ allows a **95% deduction** of the GILTI inclusion (gross GILTI, not net of the §250 deduction), treating GILTI as a dividend received from a foreign subsidiary for purposes of N.J.S.A. 54:10A-4(k)(5).
- The remaining **5% of GILTI is taxable** at NJ rates (the deemed-expense disallowance representing direct and indirect expenses associated with producing the dividend, applied at the statutory 5% rate).
- The federal IRC §250(a) GILTI deduction (50% for 2018–2025) is **not separately allowed** because NJ has its own 95% mechanism.

### 7.2 §250 FDII deduction

NJ allows the federal §250 FDII deduction because it flows through federal taxable income and NJ has not separately decoupled. Reviewer should confirm — there is recurring legislative pressure to decouple FDII, and budget proposals occasionally include a decoupling provision.

### 7.3 Apportionment of GILTI

Per TB-92, GILTI included at 5% is apportioned using the regular single-sales factor of the **including US member** — it does not get a special "GILTI factor" treatment as in some other states (e.g., the failed Maryland approach). The CFC's foreign receipts are not added to the denominator.

### 7.4 Subpart F

Subpart F income receives the same 95% dividend deduction treatment under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-4(k)(5), so 5% is taxable. This long predates GILTI and applies the same conceptual deemed-expense disallowance.

### 7.5 §163(j) interest limitation

NJ conforms to federal §163(j) at the entity level (separate-company computation for combined group members). The Division has confirmed that the combined group does not get to compute §163(j) on a consolidated basis even though it files a combined return — each member's §163(j) limit is separately computed.

## 8. Net operating losses (PNOL pool)

### 8.1 Pre-2019 PNOLs frozen and converted

When NJ moved to combined reporting and made other base changes effective 2019, all pre-2019 net operating losses were converted to "Prior Net Operating Loss conversion carryovers" (**PNOLs**) under N.J.S.A. 54:10A-4(k)(6)(D). This mirrors the New York PNOL conversion of 2015. The conversion preserves the dollar value of the loss but ties it to the new combined-reporting and single-sales framework.

### 8.2 Carryforward period

- PNOLs: **20-year carryforward** from the year the loss was incurred.
- Post-2019 NOLs: **20-year carryforward**.
- **No carryback** is permitted under NJ law (NJ did not adopt the federal CARES Act 5-year carryback).
- NOL/PNOL deduction is **per-member** in a combined return — no sharing across the group (subject to §381-type exceptions).

### 8.3 Order of application

For a combined group member with both PNOLs and post-2019 NOLs:

1. Apply current year deductions and exclusions (including GILTI 95% deduction).
2. Apply PNOLs first (oldest first, FIFO).
3. Apply post-2019 NOLs next (oldest first, FIFO).
4. Compute regular CBT.
5. **Corporate Transit Fee is applied to the base BEFORE NOL/PNOL absorption.** (TB-103 specifically addresses this — the Transit Fee does not benefit from NOL/PNOL deduction; this is a critical reviewer point that can swing seven-figure tax bills.)

### 8.4 §382 limitations

NJ generally follows federal §382 ownership-change loss limitations, with the limitation computed on a state-specific basis tied to NJ entire net income, not federal taxable income. The Division's audit position is that the §382 base limitation amount (value of the loss corporation × long-term tax-exempt rate) is the same as federal, but the application is to NJ ENI.

## 9. Filing, payment, and estimated tax

### 9.1 Form CBT-100 / CBT-100U

- **Form CBT-100** — separate-entity filer (rare post-2019; usually only for entities not in a combined group).
- **Form CBT-100U** — mandatory unitary combined return (the standard filing form for almost all multi-entity NJ taxpayers).
- **Form CBT-100S** — S-corporation (rarely used post-P.L. 2022 c. 133; only for the small population of entities that affirmatively opted out of NJ S treatment).
- **Form BFC-1** — banking and financial corporations (out of scope of this skill).

### 9.2 Due dates

- **Original return:** 15th day of the 4th month following the close of the privilege period. For calendar-year filers: **April 15**.
- **Extension:** automatic 6-month extension via Form CBT-200-T (file by original due date, must pay 90% of tax to avoid extension penalty). Extended due date for calendar year: October 15.
- **Combined returns:** managerial member files on behalf of the group; only one return per group.

### 9.3 Estimated payments

CBT estimated tax is required when total CBT (after credits) exceeds $500. Quarterly installment due dates:

| Installment | Calendar-year due | Required percentage of prior-year tax (110% if prior-year tax ≥ $50K) |
|---|---|---|
| 1st | April 15 | 25% |
| 2nd | June 15 | 50% cumulative |
| 3rd | September 15 | 75% cumulative |
| 4th | December 15 | 100% cumulative |

Estimated tax voucher: **Form CBT-150**.

For new corporations, the safe harbor in the first year is generally the minimum tax. For corporations with prior-year tax under $50,000, the standard 100% prior-year safe harbor applies; for $50,000 and over, 110% of prior-year is required. The Corporate Transit Fee liability **is included** in the estimated tax computation.

### 9.4 Payment mechanics

Electronic filing and payment are mandatory for corporations with prior-year tax of $10,000 or more (NJ Division of Taxation electronic-filing mandate). Combined groups file electronically regardless of size.

### 9.5 Statute of limitations

- General: 4 years from filing date (longer of return filed date or due date).
- 25% omission: 6 years.
- Fraud / no return: unlimited.
- Federal RAR (revenue agent's report) adjustments: must be reported to NJ within 90 days under N.J.S.A. 54:49-6(b).

## 10. BAIT — overview and eligibility

### 10.1 What BAIT is

The Business Alternative Income Tax (BAIT) is an **elective entity-level tax** under P.L. 2019 c. 320 (effective tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2020) that creates a refundable credit at the owner level. Its purpose: allow pass-through entity owners to effectively deduct the NJ income tax on their entity income above the federal $10,000 SALT cap, because the entity-level tax is deductible at the federal level under IRS Notice 2020-75.

### 10.2 Who is eligible to elect

Eligible entities are **pass-through entities** with at least one member subject to NJ Gross Income Tax (i.e., at least one individual, estate, or trust owner). Eligible entity types:

- Partnerships (general, limited, LLP).
- LLCs taxed as partnerships for federal purposes.
- Federal S-corporations.
- Single-member LLCs are **NOT eligible** (they are disregarded for federal tax, so no entity exists to make the election; the owner pays GIT directly).
- C-corporations are **NOT eligible** (they pay CBT, not GIT).

### 10.3 Annual election

The BAIT election is **annual** (not perpetual). It must be made for each tax year separately. Election mechanics:

- File a separate election form (electronically via the NJ Division of Taxation's online portal) **on or before the original due date** of the entity's return (no extensions for the election itself, though estimated payments can sometimes substitute as a constructive election under Division guidance).
- All members at the time of election must consent (or the entity's operating agreement must authorize the election).
- Election cannot be revoked once made for that year.

### 10.4 P.L. 2021 c. 419 expansion (effective 2022)

Major changes effective January 1, 2022:

- **Tax base expanded** to include the share of all distributive proceeds (not just the share attributable to NJ-source income). This eliminates the prior "double tax" issue for resident owners of out-of-state PTEs.
- **Guaranteed payments** to partners now included in the BAIT base (previously excluded).
- **Resident/non-resident split repealed**: under the post-2022 regime, the entity computes BAIT on the entirety of its income attributable to NJ resident partners (worldwide) plus its NJ-source income attributable to non-resident partners.
- Excess BAIT credits (where credit exceeds owner's GIT liability) became **refundable** to the owner.

## 11. BAIT rates and computation (2025)

### 11.1 Graduated rate structure

The BAIT applies **graduated brackets** that mirror the NJ Gross Income Tax brackets (which is what makes BAIT economically neutral for owners — the credit roughly equals what GIT would have been). For tax year 2025:

| Sum of each member's share of distributive proceeds | BAIT marginal rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $250,000 | 5.675% |
| $250,001 – $1,000,000 | 6.52% |
| $1,000,001 – $5,000,000 | 6.99% |
| Over $5,000,000 | 10.9% |

(The top 10.9% rate reflects the post-2020 "millionaire's tax" on NJ GIT, which was raised from 8.97% to 10.75% for individuals above $1M and 10.9% applied for BAIT to recognize the entity-level economic equivalence for very high-income owners. Reviewer note: the task brief mentions 9.12% for >$5M, which was the 2020–2021 rate before the millionaire's tax was incorporated into BAIT brackets via P.L. 2021 c. 419 — the current top rate is **10.9%**, matching the GIT millionaire bracket. Verify against current Division publication GIT-DEP and BAIT instructions before sign-off.)

### 11.2 Computation steps

1. Compute the entity's federal taxable income or partnership ordinary income, adjusted for NJ modifications.
2. Determine each member's distributive share of those proceeds (post-2022: include guaranteed payments).
3. **Resident members:** include 100% of their distributive share (NJ-source plus other-state).
4. **Non-resident members:** include only the NJ-source portion (post-apportionment).
5. Sum across all members to arrive at the **aggregate BAIT base**.
6. Apply the graduated brackets to the aggregate base — the brackets are NOT applied per-member, they are applied to the entity-level aggregate (this is a critical and counterintuitive point that catches preparers).

### 11.3 Aggregation point

Because brackets apply at the aggregate level, BAIT is **regressive at the member level** — a partner with $200K of distributive proceeds in a $10M-base entity has their share taxed at the marginal 10.9% rate, not at the 5.675% rate that would apply if computed individually. The owner credit (§13) recovers this at the GIT level, so the BAIT/credit interaction is generally neutral for NJ residents.

## 12. BAIT estimated payments and filing

### 12.1 Estimated payments

Quarterly estimated BAIT payments are required if the entity expects BAIT liability over $500. Due dates (calendar-year entities):

| Installment | Due date | Cumulative percentage |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | April 15 | 25% |
| Q2 | June 15 | 50% |
| Q3 | September 15 | 75% |
| Q4 | January 15 (of the following year) | 100% |

Note that the Q4 due date is January 15 of the following year (a quirk relative to CBT which has a December 15 Q4) — this matches the GIT calendar so the credit timing works for owners.

Form **PTE-150** is the voucher. Underpayment exposes the entity to penalty and interest under N.J.S.A. 54:53-15.

### 12.2 Annual return — Form PTE-100

The annual return is **Form PTE-100**, due on or before the **15th day of the 3rd month** following the close of the tax year. For calendar-year entities: **March 15** — same as the federal partnership / S-corp return deadline. Extension via Form PTE-200-T extends to September 15.

### 12.3 PTE-K1 — owner schedules

Each member receives a **Schedule PTE-K1** from the entity reporting:

- The member's distributive share of BAIT-base income.
- The member's share of BAIT paid by the entity.
- The member's share of any non-resident withholding (which is separate from BAIT).

The owner uses the PTE-K1 to claim the BAIT credit on their own return.

## 13. Owner credit and federal/state interaction

### 13.1 Credit at the owner level

Owners claim the BAIT credit on:

- **Individuals:** Form NJ-1040 / NJ-1040-NR, Schedule NJ-BUS-1 and Schedule NJ-BUS-2. The credit is **refundable** — to the extent the credit exceeds GIT liability, it is refunded.
- **Corporate owners (upper-tier C-corps):** the credit flows through but generally cannot be refunded at the C-corp level; it offsets CBT liability.
- **Pass-through owners (tiered structures):** the upper-tier PTE either claims the credit against its own BAIT (if it elected) or passes it through to its own members on its PTE-K1.

### 13.2 Federal deductibility — the whole point

IRS Notice 2020-75 confirms that BAIT (and similar state PTET regimes) is deductible at the **entity level** as a business expense, reducing the entity's federal ordinary income that flows to owners. This deduction is **not subject to the §164(b)(6) $10K SALT cap** because it is a business tax, not an itemized state and local tax on the individual.

Effect: a NJ resident partner in a $1M-income partnership who would otherwise have paid roughly $89,700 of NJ GIT personally (capped at $10K federal deduction) instead has the partnership pay $66,000 BAIT (deductible federally, saving $24,420 federal tax at 37% rate), then claims a $66,000 NJ refundable credit against the GIT that would have been due. Net federal tax savings: roughly $24K per $1M of NJ-resident-attributable income.

### 13.3 Resident credit for taxes paid to other states — interaction

This is the **most common BAIT planning trap**. Under N.J.S.A. 54A:4-1, a NJ resident gets a credit on Form NJ-1040 Schedule NJ-COJ for income taxes paid to other states on income also taxed by NJ. The interaction with BAIT-style PTETs in other states is:

- If a NJ resident is a partner in a NY partnership that elects NY PTET, the NY PTET payment is a **business expense at the entity level** for federal purposes, reducing the partner's federal K-1 income. But for NJ resident-credit purposes, the NJ Division of Taxation's position (TB-86R / TB-100) is that the NJ resident **CANNOT claim a Schedule NJ-COJ credit for NY PTET paid by the partnership** — because the tax was paid by the entity, not by the resident. The resident can only claim a NJ-COJ credit if the resident **also pays NY non-resident GIT** on the same income.
- This creates a planning issue where NJ residents may be worse off when NY PTET is elected at the entity level — they lose the NJ resident credit. Many NJ residents instead want the NY partnership **not** to elect PTET, or want a carve-out.
- Conversely, NJ's BAIT does **not** create the reverse problem for non-NJ residents claiming credits in their home state — most states honor BAIT as a creditable state tax.

Reviewer must flag any multi-state PTE engagement for this trap.

### 13.4 Form NJ-1080-C / composite returns

Composite return Form NJ-1080-C remains available for non-resident partners. A non-resident partner CANNOT be on both a composite return and claim a BAIT credit on a separately filed NJ-1040-NR — the partner must choose. The composite is generally inferior post-BAIT because it does not capture the federal SALT cap workaround.

## 14. BAIT vs CBT — interaction and entity-choice planning

For a NJ accounting practice, the key entity-choice questions in 2025:

- **C-corp under CBT:** 11.5% top rate (with Transit Fee), but no shareholder-level NJ tax on retained earnings; dividends to shareholders bear separate GIT. Combined effective top rate on distributed earnings: roughly 21% (NJ-only) — uncompetitive.
- **S-corp / partnership with BAIT election:** 10.9% top rate at entity (paid by the entity), then the owner gets a refundable credit equal to BAIT paid; net NJ tax on the owner is the GIT rate (1.4%–10.75%) with the BAIT credit offsetting it. Effective NJ tax: approximately equal to GIT, but with the federal SALT-cap workaround saving ~37% × NJ tax amount in federal tax.
- **S-corp / partnership WITHOUT BAIT election:** owners pay full NJ GIT, federal deduction capped at $10K, no benefit. Strictly inferior to BAIT election for any entity with NJ resident owners and material income.

The default reviewer recommendation in 2025: **elect BAIT for any qualifying entity with NJ resident or NJ-source-income partners above ~$100K, unless tier-structure or partner-mix considerations create offsetting drawbacks** (e.g., tax-exempt or out-of-state-resident partners who don't benefit from the credit).

## 15. Worked examples

### Example 1 — Small NJ-only C-corp

**Facts:** ABC Widgets Inc., a NJ-domiciled C-corp with all operations in NJ. 2025 federal taxable income $80,000, no apportionment issues (100% NJ). No GILTI, no NOLs, no special adjustments. NJ gross receipts $1,200,000.

**Computation:**

1. NJ entire net income (ENI): $80,000.
2. Apportionment: 100% NJ (single-state filer).
3. Allocated NJ ENI: $80,000.
4. Bracket: $80,000 is in the $50,001–$100,000 band → **7.5% rate**.
5. Regular CBT: $80,000 × 7.5% = **$6,000**.
6. Corporate Transit Fee: $80,000 is below the $10M threshold → **$0**.
7. Minimum tax: NJ gross receipts of $1.2M is in the $1M+ band → **$2,000**, but minimum tax applies only if the regular tax is below the minimum; since $6,000 > $2,000, minimum tax is not the controlling amount.
8. **Total CBT: $6,000.**
9. Estimated tax: assuming 2024 tax was $5,500, the prior-year safe harbor is $5,500 (under $50K so 100%). Quarterly installments of $1,375.
10. Filing: Form CBT-100, due April 15, 2026.

**Reviewer note:** the graduated bracket is highly beneficial here — at 9% the tax would have been $7,200. Always ensure the form picks up the lower bracket band when ENI ≤ $100K.

### Example 2 — Large multistate C-corp hitting the Corporate Transit Fee

**Facts:** MegaCo Inc., Delaware-domiciled, files combined return CBT-100U as managerial member of a group with 12 unitary members. 2025 combined federal taxable income $200,000,000. NJ apportionment factor (single-sales, market-based) = 8%. Pre-2019 PNOL pool of $40,000,000 still available. GILTI inclusion $20,000,000.

**Computation:**

1. **Combined ENI before NJ modifications:** $200,000,000 (federal).
2. GILTI adjustment: include $20M federally, allow 95% NJ deduction = ($19,000,000) → net taxable GILTI $1,000,000. So $20M federal becomes $1M for NJ — net subtraction of $19,000,000.
3. **Combined ENI (NJ): $200,000,000 − $19,000,000 = $181,000,000.**
4. Apportion: $181M × 8% = **$14,480,000 allocated NJ ENI.**
5. **Corporate Transit Fee base** (BEFORE NOL): $14,480,000 − $10,000,000 = $4,480,000 above threshold.
6. **Corporate Transit Fee: $4,480,000 × 2.5% = $112,000.**
7. PNOL absorption: $14,480,000 − $14,480,000 (cap; cannot exceed allocated ENI; $40M available, $14.48M used) = $0 ENI for regular CBT.

   Wait — PNOL absorption is capped to taxable income; using $14.48M of PNOL.
8. **Regular CBT base after PNOL: $0.**
9. **Regular CBT (9% rate band): $0.**
10. Minimum tax: 12 members × $2,000 (large-affiliated-group floor) = **$24,000 minimum tax**, but since the regular tax is $0 and Transit Fee is $112,000, total tax exceeds minimum. **Each member must still meet its minimum** — reviewer must verify the Transit Fee allocation per member plus minimum tax floor per member.
11. **Total CBT: $112,000 (Corporate Transit Fee) + $24,000 (minimum tax floor) = $136,000.**
12. PNOL remaining for carryforward: $40M − $14.48M = $25.52M.

**Reviewer notes:**
- The Corporate Transit Fee is the entire substantive tax this year, because PNOLs wipe out the regular CBT base but **do not** reduce the Transit Fee base.
- This is the policy choice that makes the Fee so painful for loss-carryforward taxpayers — it functions as a quasi-minimum tax on large filers.
- If the group's effective NJ apportionment factor had been higher (say 25%), the Fee would have been roughly $1.13M.

### Example 3 — Partnership BAIT election with $3M income, mixed-residence partners

**Facts:** XYZ Consulting LLP, NJ-domiciled professional services partnership. 2025 distributive proceeds (after guaranteed payments): $3,000,000. Three equal partners: Alice (NJ resident), Bob (NJ resident), Carol (NY resident). Apportionment factor for NJ-source income: 60% (some out-of-state engagements). Guaranteed payments: $150,000 to each partner ($450,000 total), already included in distributive proceeds for BAIT.

**Computation:**

1. **BAIT base determination (post-2022 rules):**
   - Alice (NJ resident): 100% of her $1,000,000 share = $1,000,000 in BAIT base.
   - Bob (NJ resident): 100% of his $1,000,000 share = $1,000,000 in BAIT base.
   - Carol (NY resident): NJ-source portion only = $1,000,000 × 60% = $600,000 in BAIT base.
   - **Total BAIT base: $2,600,000.**

2. **Apply graduated brackets to the aggregate $2,600,000:**
   - $0 – $250,000 @ 5.675% = $14,187.50
   - $250,001 – $1,000,000 ($750,000) @ 6.52% = $48,900
   - $1,000,001 – $2,600,000 ($1,600,000) @ 6.99% = $111,840
   - **Total BAIT: $174,927.50.**

3. **Allocate BAIT among members** in proportion to each member's share of the BAIT base:
   - Alice: $1,000,000 / $2,600,000 × $174,927.50 = **$67,280** credit on PTE-K1.
   - Bob: same as Alice = **$67,280**.
   - Carol: $600,000 / $2,600,000 × $174,927.50 = **$40,368** credit on PTE-K1.

4. **Quarterly estimated BAIT:** $174,927.50 / 4 = $43,732 each quarter (or use annualized method per N.J.S.A. 54:53-7). Due April 15, June 15, Sep 15, Jan 15 2026.

5. **Annual return Form PTE-100:** due March 15, 2026.

6. **Federal effect:** the $174,927.50 BAIT is deductible at the LLP level as a state business tax, reducing federal ordinary income on partners' K-1s by $174,927.50 in proportion to their share of the deduction. Assuming a 37% federal marginal rate, this saves roughly $64,723 in aggregate federal tax across partners.

7. **NJ resident credit interaction for Alice and Bob:**
   - On their NJ-1040s, they claim the BAIT credit ($67,280 each) as a refundable credit.
   - Their NJ GIT on $1M each at the 10.75% millionaire's rate (above $1M) is approximately $89,170. The $67,280 credit offsets it; net NJ GIT owed: ~$21,890 each.
   - (If the BAIT had not been elected, they would have owed the full $89,170 each with only a $10,000 federal deduction. With BAIT, they save federal tax via the entity-level deduction and pay only ~$21,890 NJ at the GIT level.)

8. **Carol (NY resident):** files NJ-1040-NR. Claims $40,368 BAIT credit (refundable). Her NJ GIT on the $600K NJ-source portion at 8.97% (non-resident) is roughly $35,000–$54,000 depending on full income — exact computation depends on her total NJ-source income from all sources and the GIT non-resident formula. The credit will be refundable to the extent it exceeds her NJ tax. She then needs to address NY treatment: NY may grant a resident credit for NJ tax paid (treating BAIT as NJ tax paid by Carol via the credit mechanism — NY's TSB-M-21(1)C aligns reasonably with this). Reviewer note: this is the kind of cross-border item to verify in NY tax-credit guidance before sign-off.

**Reviewer notes:**
- Failure to make the election by March 15 is irrevocable for the year. The election cannot be made on an amended return or with the extended return.
- If any partner is a tax-exempt entity (e.g., a charitable trust or pension partner), the credit is wasted (cannot offset their tax) — modeling required before electing.
- If any partner is a non-resident in a state that doesn't honor the NJ BAIT credit (a small minority), the federal SALT-cap saving may be partially offset by lost home-state resident credit — modeling required.

## 16. Self-checks for the reviewer

- [ ] CBT bracket: confirm the correct bracket (6.5% / 7.5% / 9%) based on allocated NJ ENI, post-apportionment, post-NOL. Re-check if ENI is near a bracket boundary ($50K, $100K).
- [ ] Corporate Transit Fee: confirm period ends on or after July 1, 2024 and before January 1, 2029. Confirm allocated ENI > $10M. Compute the Fee on the post-apportionment, pre-NOL base.
- [ ] Minimum tax: applied per member in combined returns; floor of $2,000 if affiliated group payroll ≥ $5M.
- [ ] Apportionment: single sales factor, market-based for services and intangibles. Confirm customer-location records for service receipts.
- [ ] Combined return: confirm common-ownership (>50%) and unitary business tests. CBT-100U filed by managerial member. Intercompany eliminations performed.
- [ ] GILTI: 95% deduction applied (5% taxable). Subpart F: same treatment. §250 FDII deduction not separately decoupled (as of 2025 — verify).
- [ ] PNOL/NOL: 20-year carryforward, no carryback. PNOLs applied before post-2019 NOLs. Neither applied to the Corporate Transit Fee base.
