## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax brackets — Single / Married filing separately (TY 2025)

| Taxable income over | But not over | Rate | Tax on lower amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0 | $20,000 | 1.4% | $0 |
| $20,000 | $35,000 | 1.75% | $280 |
| $35,000 | $40,000 | 3.5% | $542.50 |
| $40,000 | $75,000 | 5.525% | $717.50 |

| $500,000 | $1,000,000 | 8.97% | $29,726.25 |
| $1,000,000 | — | 10.75% | $74,576.25 |

### Tax brackets — Married filing jointly / Head of household / Qualifying surviving spouse (TY 2025)

| Taxable income over | But not over | Rate | Tax on lower amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0 | $20,000 | 1.4% | $0 |
| $20,000 | $50,000 | 1.75% | $280 |
| $50,000 | $70,000 | 2.45% | $805 |

| $1,000,000 | — | 10.75% | $72,657.50 |

### $100,000 rule

If NJ taxable income is **$100,000 or more**, you **must** use the NJ Tax Rate Schedules (above) instead of the tax tables.

### Personal exemptions (TY 2025)

| Exemption | Amount |
|---|---|
| Taxpayer | $1,000 |
| Spouse (MFJ) | $1,000 |
| Each dependent | $1,500 |
| Age 65+ (additional) | $1,000 |
| Blind/disabled (additional) | $1,000 |
| Veteran | $6,000 |

New Jersey does **not** have a standard deduction. It uses a personal exemption system instead.

### Local income tax

New Jersey does **not** permit local income taxes.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Critical difference:** New Jersey does **NOT** start from federal AGI or federal taxable income. NJ has its own gross income definition (NJ Gross Income) with its own categories of income.

NJ Gross Income includes income from 18 categories defined in N.J.S.A. 54A:5-1, including:
- Net profits from business (similar to Schedule C)
- Wages, salaries, tips
- Net gains or income from disposition of property
- Interest, dividends, and other investment income
- Rental income
- Pension/retirement income

### Computation flow

1. **Compute NJ Gross Income** from each NJ category (NOT from federal AGI)
2. **Subtract NJ exemptions** (personal exemptions, not a standard deduction)
3. **Apply NJ deductions** (limited list — medical expenses over 2% of NJ gross income, Archer MSA contributions, health enterprise zone deductions, qualified conservation contributions)
4. **Result = NJ taxable income**
5. **Apply the graduated rate schedule** → NJ tax
6. **Apply credits** → final tax due or refund

### Key NJ vs. federal differences

| Item | Federal treatment | NJ treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Starting point | AGI | NJ Gross Income (own categories) |
| Standard deduction | Yes ($15,000 single 2025) | No — NJ has no standard deduction |
| 401(k)/403(b) contributions | Pre-tax (excluded from wages) | **Taxable** — NJ does not exclude employee retirement contributions |
| IRA deductions | Deductible (traditional IRA) | **Not deductible** for NJ purposes |
| Self-employed health insurance | Deductible from AGI | **Not deductible** for NJ purposes |
| Capital gains | Preferential rates (0/15/20%) | Taxed as ordinary income at NJ rates |
| Social Security | Up to 85% taxable | **Fully exempt** |
| Property taxes | SALT cap ($10,000 federal) | Property tax deduction up to $15,000 (or credit for income under $150,000) |
| Alimony (pre-2019 agreements) | Deductible/includible | Deductible/includible (NJ conforms) |
| Net operating losses | Deductible | NJ does not allow NOL deductions for individuals |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income

NJ taxes net profits from business as a separate category of NJ Gross Income. The computation is similar to federal Schedule C but with NJ-specific rules. Key differences:

- **Depreciation:** NJ generally conforms to federal depreciation, but verify conformity with recent federal changes (OBBBA provisions).
- **Self-employed health insurance:** NOT deductible for NJ purposes (it is deductible federally).
- **Self-employed retirement contributions:** NOT deductible for NJ purposes (already excluded at the contribution level for Keogh/SEP plans — verify).
- **Home office deduction:** NJ generally conforms to federal rules.

### Estimated tax

NJ requires estimated tax payments if you expect to owe **$400 or more** in NJ income tax after subtracting withholding.

| Installment | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form NJ-1040-ES is used for estimated tax payments.

### NJ self-employment tax interaction

NJ does not impose its own self-employment tax (Social Security/Medicare). Those are federal only. However, NJ does not allow a deduction for the federal self-employment tax deduction (the deductible half of SE tax). Since NJ starts from its own gross income definition rather than federal AGI, this difference is structural.

### Property tax deduction / credit

Self-employed NJ residents who own their home can deduct property taxes up to $15,000 on their NJ return. This is separate from the federal SALT cap. Alternatively, taxpayers with NJ gross income of $150,000 or less may claim a property tax credit.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| Rule ID | Rule | Source |
|---|---|---|
| NJ-T1-01 | NJ taxable income = NJ Gross Income − exemptions − NJ deductions | N.J.S.A. 54A:2-1 |
| NJ-T1-02 | Tax computed using graduated schedule: 1.4% – 10.75% (TY 2025) | N.J.S.A. 54A:2-1 |
| NJ-T1-03 | NJ starts from own gross income categories, NOT federal AGI | N.J.S.A. 54A:5-1 |
| NJ-T1-04 | No standard deduction; personal exemptions only ($1,000 taxpayer, $1,500 dependent) | N.J.S.A. 54A:3-1 |
| NJ-T1-05 | 401(k)/403(b) contributions are taxable for NJ purposes | N.J.S.A. 54A:6-21 |
| NJ-T1-06 | Social Security benefits are fully exempt | N.J.S.A. 54A:6-2 |
| NJ-T1-07 | Capital gains taxed at ordinary income rates (no preferential rate) | N.J.S.A. 54A:5-1(c) |
| NJ-T1-08 | Estimated tax required if expected liability ≥ $400 | N.J.S.A. 54A:9-6 |
| NJ-T1-09 | If taxable income ≥ $100,000, must use Tax Rate Schedules | NJ-1040 Instructions |
| NJ-T1-10 | Property tax deduction capped at $15,000 | N.J.S.A. 54A:3A-1 |

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Situation | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| NJ-T2-01 | **Multi-state income:** Taxpayer earns income in another state | NJ taxes worldwide income of residents. Credit for taxes paid to other states available. Complex for NY/NJ commuters — verify convenience-of-the-employer issues. |
| NJ-T2-02 | **NY/NJ commuter tax interaction** | NJ residents working in NY pay NY tax on NY-source income and get a credit on their NJ return. However, NJ may challenge the credit if the NY tax was based on the convenience-of-the-employer rule. |
| NJ-T2-03 | **Business income categorization** | NJ's 18 income categories can create allocation issues for self-employed taxpayers with mixed income types. Review whether income should be "net profits from business" or another category. |
| NJ-T2-04 | **PTET/BAIT election** | NJ's Pass-Through Business Alternative Income Tax allows certain pass-throughs to pay entity-level tax. Not applicable to sole proprietors but relevant for multi-member LLCs. |
| NJ-T2-05 | **Federal conformity for depreciation** | Verify NJ's current position on federal bonus depreciation and OBBBA changes. NJ's non-conformity with certain federal provisions may require separate depreciation schedules. |
