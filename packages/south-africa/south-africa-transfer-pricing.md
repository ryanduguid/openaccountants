## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

### 3.1 Definition

Section 31(2) ITA: Where a transaction has been entered into between connected persons and the terms/conditions differ from arm's length terms, and the taxpayer derives a tax benefit, an adjustment must be made to reflect arm's length conditions.
