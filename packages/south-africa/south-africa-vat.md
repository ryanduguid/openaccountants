## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the tax period in CSV, PDF, or pasted text. VAT registration number (starting with 4).

**Recommended** — tax invoices for all input tax claims above ZAR 5,000, sales invoices for all output, prior period excess credit (Field 14).

**Ideal** — complete creditors/debtors ledger, import VAT certificates (SAD500), asset register, prior VAT201 return.

**Refusal if minimum missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement = hard stop. "Input tax credits require a valid VAT tax invoice per Section 20 of the VAT Act. All credits are provisional pending invoice verification."

### Refusal catalogue

**R-ZA-1 — Non-VAT-registered vendor.** "Only registered vendors can charge VAT and claim input tax. Confirm VAT registration before proceeding."

**R-ZA-2 — Partial exemption / apportionment.** "If the vendor makes both taxable and exempt supplies, input tax must be apportioned under Section 17(1) of the VAT Act. The apportionment ratio changes annually — out of scope without full-year data. Escalate to a CA(SA)."

**R-ZA-3 — Capital goods scheme (Section 18A).** "Adjustments to input tax on capital goods where use changes between taxable and non-taxable purposes require specialist computation. Out of scope."

**R-ZA-4 — Financial services (Section 2).** "Financial services have complex VAT treatment. Banks, insurers, and financial institutions require specialist handling. Out of scope."

**R-ZA-5 — Property transactions.** "Property development, sale of commercial property, and going-concern zero-rating elections are highly fact-sensitive. Escalate to specialist."

## Section 4 — Worked examples

Six classifications from a hypothetical Johannesburg-based IT consultant. Format: FNB (First National Bank) account statement.

### Example 1 — Domestic B2B revenue (15%)

**Input line:**
`15 Apr 2025  CREDIT  ABC TECHNOLOGY (PTY) LTD  INV-2025-041  R 115,000.00  R 500,000.00`

**Reasoning:**
Incoming R 115,000 (VAT-inclusive) from a SA company for IT consulting. Standard 15% VAT. Gross R 115,000 includes VAT. Net = R 100,000 (taxable supply) + R 15,000 output tax (R 115,000 × 15/115). A VAT-compliant tax invoice must be issued per Section 20 of the VAT Act. Report R 115,000 VAT-inclusive on VAT201 Field 1. Output VAT R 15,000 goes to Field 4.

**Classification:** Output tax 15% — R 15,000. Net supply: R 100,000. VAT-inclusive: R 115,000.

### Example 2 — Export service (zero-rated)

**Input line:**
`22 Apr 2025  CREDIT  ACME CORP USA  USD 5,000 (R 92,500)  R 592,500.00`

**Reasoning:**
USD receipt from a US company for IT consulting services exported from South Africa. Zero-rated under Schedule 1 of the VAT Act if the services are physically performed in SA but consumed outside SA. Evidence: contract showing foreign client, payment in foreign currency. Report R 92,500 on Field 2 (zero-rated). Output tax: R 0.

**Classification:** Zero-rated export — R 92,500. Output tax: R 0.

### Example 3 — Electricity (15%, input credit)

**Input line:**
`10 Apr 2025  DEBIT  ESKOM HOLDINGS SOC  April electricity  -R 11,500.00  R 388,500.00`

**Reasoning:**
Eskom electricity bill. Taxable at 15%. Gross R 11,500. Net = R 10,000 + R 1,500 input tax (R 11,500 × 15/115). Eskom issues VAT-compliant tax invoices — input credit of R 1,500 claimable. Report on Field 15 (input VAT on other goods/services).

**Classification:** Input tax 15% — R 1,500. Net expense: R 10,000.

### Example 4 — Zero-rated food (basic foodstuffs)

**Input line:**
`12 Apr 2025  DEBIT  PICK N PAY  Groceries (business kitchen)  -R 800.00  R 387,700.00`

**Reasoning:**
Grocery purchase. If itemised receipt shows basic foodstuffs only (brown bread, eggs, fresh vegetables, etc.) — zero-rated under Schedule 2 of the VAT Act. No input tax on zero-rated items (the input tax rate is 0%). If mixed grocery (some 15% non-food items), split the purchase. Without itemised receipt: conservative default is 15% on full amount.

**Classification:** Zero-rated (if basic foodstuffs only) — R 0 input tax. Conservative default: 15% on R 800 = R 104 input tax / (R 695.65 net + R 104 VAT = R 800 gross). Flag: obtain itemised receipt.

### Example 5 — Imported service — self-assess (Google Ads)

**Input line:**
`08 Apr 2025  DEBIT  GOOGLE IRELAND LIMITED  Google Ads April  -R 10,000.00  R 377,700.00`

**Reasoning:**
Google Ads billed from Ireland. Note: Google typically bills SA VAT directly now via its local entity; check the invoice. If billed by a non-resident entity, this is an "imported service" under Section 7(1)(c) of the VAT Act. The South African VAT-registered vendor must self-assess 15% VAT. Self-assessed output: R 10,000 × 15% = R 1,500 (add to Field 12 — other output adjustments and imported services). For a fully taxable vendor, simultaneously claim same as input tax R 1,500 (Field 15 — input VAT on other goods/services). Net effect: zero. Must be disclosed in the VAT201.

**Classification:** Imported service — self-assess output R 1,500 (Field 12); input R 1,500 (Field 15). Net: R 0 for fully taxable vendor.

### Example 6 — Residential rent (exempt, no input tax)

**Input line:**
`01 Apr 2025  DEBIT  CITY PROP MANAGEMENT  April office rent  -R 23,000.00  R 354,700.00`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly rent. If this is for a commercial office space where the landlord has opted to charge VAT and issues a VAT invoice showing 15%, then input tax of R 3,000 is claimable (gross R 23,000 / 1.15 × 15%). If the landlord has NOT opted to charge VAT (which is common for smaller landlords), then the rent is exempt and no input tax is available. Default: ask for the landlord's VAT invoice.

**Classification:** Tier 2 — ask. If VAT invoice received from landlord: Input 15% — R 3,000. If no VAT invoice: EXEMPT — no input tax.
