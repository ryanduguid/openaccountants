## Section 2 -- Rate, scope and minimum tax

- **Standard IS rate** — 27.5%
- **IS is greater of computed IS or MFP** — IS is the greater of computed IS (27.5% × profit) and the MFP (0.5% of turnover HT; floor 1,000,000 FCFA RNI / 300,000 FCFA RSI). New companies are exempt from MFP for the first year.
- **Entities subject to IS by right and by option** — Subject to IS by right: SA, SARL/SAU, cooperatives, other profit-making legal persons, and non-resident companies with a BF permanent establishment. SNC/SCS/sociétés de fait/GIE are taxed at IR on partners unless they elect IS (election by all partners within 3 months of the fiscal-year start; irrevocable).

## Section 3 -- Taxable base and key non-deductibles

- **Taxable base and deductibility of charges** — Assessed on profits from enterprises operated in Burkina Faso (plus treaty-attributed profits). Charges deductible if booked in the period, in the direct interest of the business, real and supported by documentation (CGI Art. 53).  _(CGI Art. 53)_
- **Non-deductible items and donation limit** — Non-deductible: fines/penalties/confiscations; excessive or fictitious remuneration to managing partners (excess reclassified as a distribution); non-qualifying provisions. Donations to recognised public-interest bodies deductible only within 3‰ of net turnover (gifts to the State deductible without limit if justified).
- **Donation deductibility limit** — 3‰ per mille of net turnover (Donations to recognised public-interest bodies deductible only within this limit; gifts to the State deductible without limit if justified)

## Section 4 -- Advance instalments and filing

- **Advance instalments schedule** — Three advance instalments (acomptes provisionnels) due 20 July (year N), 20 October (year N), 20 January (year N+1), computed from 75% of the prior closed year's IS (annualised if that year was not 12 months). The balance is paid by the 30 April declaration deadline.
- **Annual return filing deadline** — Annual return / états financiers filed by 30 April (insurance/reinsurance 31 May).

## Section 5 -- Withholding on distributions (IRCM / IRVM)

- **IRCM/IRVM on dividends and distributions** — 12.5% (reduced to 6.25% for newly created companies during their first 3 fiscal years)
- **IRCM/IRVM on bond interest** — 6%
- **Scope of IRCM/IRVM** — Scope includes dividends, interest, capital reimbursements, and directors' tantièmes/jetons de présence.

## Section 6 -- Prohibitions

- **Prohibition: IS on non-electing sole proprietor/SNC/SCS/GIE** — NEVER apply IS to a sole proprietor or to an SNC/SCS/GIE that has not elected IS — those use IR/IBICA (see bf-income-tax).
- **Prohibition: IS below MFP floor** — NEVER report IS below the MFP floor.
- **Prohibition: skipping acomptes** — NEVER skip the three acomptes (20 July / 20 Oct / 20 Jan).
- **Prohibition: engine computing numbers** — NEVER compute numbers — the engine handles arithmetic.
- **Confirmation requirement** — Confirm every article number and the acompte dates against the current consolidated CGI before filing.
