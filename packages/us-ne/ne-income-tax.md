| Single | $157 |
| Married filing jointly | $314 |
| Each dependent | $157 |

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Nebraska taxable income starts with **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Start with federal AGI** → Form 1040N, Line 3
2. **Add NE additions** (Schedule I) — items NE adds back
3. **Subtract NE subtractions** (Schedule I) — items NE excludes
4. **Subtract Nebraska standard deduction or itemized deductions** (Nebraska follows federal amounts with modifications)
5. **Result = Nebraska taxable income**
6. **Apply the graduated rate schedule** → Nebraska tax
7. **Subtract personal exemption credit and other credits** (Schedule II)
8. **Result = final tax due or refund**

### Key addition modifications (Schedule I)

| Addition | Description |
|---|---|
| State/local bond interest | Interest from bonds of states other than NE |
| Bonus depreciation add-back | NE partially decouples from IRC §168(k) — verify current conformity status |

### Key subtraction modifications (Schedule I)

| Subtraction | Description |
|---|---|
| US government bond interest | Interest from US Treasury obligations |
| State income tax refund | If included in federal AGI |
| Social Security (partial) | Nebraska is phasing out Social Security taxation — for TY 2025, Social Security benefits are fully exempt |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income flow

Schedule C net profit flows into federal AGI, which is the starting point for Nebraska. Nebraska conforms to the federal self-employment tax deduction (the deductible half of SE tax is already reflected in federal AGI).

### Estimated tax

Nebraska requires estimated tax payments if you expect to owe **$500 or more** in Nebraska income tax after subtracting withholding and credits.

| Installment | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form 1040N-ES is used for estimated tax payments.

### Depreciation

Nebraska's conformity with federal bonus depreciation under IRC §168(k) should be verified for the current tax year. Nebraska has historically required partial add-backs for bonus depreciation in certain years. Check the 2025 Form 1040N instructions.

### Nebraska inheritance tax

Nebraska is one of six states with an inheritance tax (separate from estate tax). This is administered at the county level and is **not** covered by this income tax skill. Self-employed taxpayers should be aware of this for estate planning purposes.
