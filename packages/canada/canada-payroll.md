## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Source Deductions)

Employers withhold both federal and provincial/territorial income tax from each pay. CRA publishes payroll deduction tables (T4032) and formulas (T4127) annually.

### Federal Tax Brackets (2026)

| Taxable Income (CAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 58,523 | 14% |
| 58,523 -- 117,045 | 20.5% |
| 117,045 -- 181,440 | 26% |
| 181,440 -- 258,482 | 29% |
| 258,482+ | 33% |

The lowest bracket rate was reduced from 15% to 14% effective for the 2026 tax year (enacted via 2025 tax reform).

### Federal Basic Personal Amount (BPA) -- 2026

| Income Level | BPA (CAD) |
|---|---|
| Up to $181,440 | $16,452 |
| $181,440 -- $258,482 | Claws back to $14,829 |
| Above $258,482 | $14,829 |

### Provincial/Territorial Tax

Each province has its own tax brackets applied on top of federal tax. The employer determines the applicable province based on the employee's **province of employment** (where they physically report to work). Employees complete a federal TD1 and a provincial TD1 form.

### Key Provincial Top Marginal Rates (Combined Federal + Provincial, 2026)

| Province | Top Combined Rate (approx.) |
|---|---|
| Ontario | ~53.5% |
| British Columbia | ~53.5% |
| Alberta | ~48.0% |
| Quebec | ~53.3% |
| Manitoba | ~50.4% |
| Saskatchewan | ~47.5% |

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1 -- Biweekly Employee (Ontario)

Annual salary $75,000. Paid biweekly (26 pay periods).

1. Gross per period: $75,000 ÷ 26 = $2,884.62
2. CPP: ($2,884.62 - $134.62 exemption) × 5.95% = $163.60
3. CPP2: if annualised earnings exceed $74,600, additional 4% applies on the excess (calculated cumulatively)
4. EI: $2,884.62 × 1.63% = $47.02
5. Federal tax: per T4032 table for biweekly pay
6. Ontario provincial tax: per T4032-ON table
7. Employer CPP: $163.60 (matches employee)
8. Employer EI: $47.02 × 1.4 = $65.83

### Pattern 2 -- Employee Reaching CPP Maximum

Employee paid $80,000 semi-monthly ($3,333.33/period). By period 11, cumulative pensionable earnings exceed YMPE $74,600. CPP deductions stop at $4,230.45. CPP2 continues until YAMPE $85,000 is reached (max $416.00). Payroll software tracks cumulative contributions and stops deducting when maximums are reached.

### Pattern 3 -- Vacation Pay Payout

Employee earning $52,000/year with 4% vacation pay. Vacation pay accrues: $52,000 × 4% = $2,080/year. Can be paid on each cheque (added to gross, subject to all deductions) or accrued and paid when vacation is taken.

### Pattern 4 -- Termination with ROE

Employee terminated without cause. Final pay includes:
- Outstanding regular wages through last day
- Accrued vacation pay (mandatory payout)
- Termination pay (if applicable under ESA -- typically 1 week per year of service)
- Severance (Ontario: 1 week per year if 5+ years and employer payroll ≥ $2.5M)

Issue ROE within 5 days via ROE Web. Code M (dismissal) or other applicable code.
