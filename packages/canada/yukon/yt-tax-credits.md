# Yukon — Provincial Tax Credits & Incentives — Skill v1.0

This skill covers the Yukon-specific personal and corporate tax credits administered alongside the federal T1/T2 return for the 2025 tax year. Yukon is the smallest sub-national jurisdiction in Canada by population but has one of the most distinctive tax credit regimes — notably the **Yukon First Nations Tax Credit (FNTC)**, which has no parallel in any other province or territory, and a **0% provincial small business CIT rate**, the most generous in Canada.

Yukon's personal income tax is administered by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) under a tax collection agreement, but the credit parameters, definitions, and unique-to-Yukon credits are set by the Yukon Department of Finance under the *Yukon Income Tax Act* (RSY 2002, c. 118).

## 1. Quick reference — personal + corporate credit summary

### Personal (Form YT428 / YT479 series)

---

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- Taxpayer residency status on **December 31, 2025** (full-year YT resident vs. part-year)
- For First Nations Tax Credit: First Nation citizenship, Settlement Land status, Self-Government Agreement reference
- T1 federal return draft (line 26000 taxable income, line 40427 federal tax)
- For corporate: T2 jacket, Schedule 5 (provincial allocation), Schedule 443 (Yukon credits), Schedule 440
- Eligible investment / R&D / mineral exploration substantiation
- Receipts for refundable personal credits (fitness, etc.)

### Refusal catalogue (out of scope for this skill)

- R-YT-1: **Non-resident of Yukon on Dec 31** — provincial credits do not apply; refer to province of residence
- R-YT-2: **Federal credit substitution** — this skill does not duplicate federal SR&ED, ITC, or CMETC computations
- R-YT-3: **First Nations Self-Government tax sharing disputes** — refer to the relevant Self-Government Financial Transfer Agreement; do not compute
- R-YT-4: **Trust returns (T3) claiming YT credits** — out of scope
- R-YT-5: **Corporate associated-group SBD allocation** — defer to a corporate tax skill
- R-YT-6: **Partial-year YT residency with mid-year FN status change** — refer to credentialed reviewer

## 3. Yukon First Nations Tax Credit (FNTC) — unique to Yukon

The FNTC is the single most distinctive feature of the Yukon personal and corporate tax system. **No other Canadian jurisdiction operates a credit of this design.** It implements the tax-sharing provisions of the Yukon Self-Government Agreements signed between Canada, Yukon, and the 11 self-governing Yukon First Nations.

### Mechanism

For an individual who is a **citizen of a self-governing Yukon First Nation** and whose income is **attributable to a Settlement Land** under a Final Agreement, the FNTC reduces Yukon personal income tax payable by an amount equivalent to up to **95% of the federal abatement** that would otherwise be remitted to the First Nation government under the Personal Income Tax Administration Agreement.

For practical computation:

1. Compute Yukon tax payable on Form YT428 as if no FNTC applied.
2. Determine the **attributable portion** of taxable income (income earned on Settlement Land or otherwise attributable under the Final Agreement).
3. Multiply by the Yukon effective rate.
4. Apply the **up to 95%** abatement factor — the residual 5% remains with the Yukon government.
5. Claim the FNTC on the designated YT428 line.

### Corporate FNTC

A corporation whose income is attributable to a Yukon First Nation Settlement Land and which is owned by, or controlled by, a self-governing Yukon First Nation, may claim a parallel corporate FNTC reducing Yukon CIT payable by up to 95% of the attributable portion.

### Key references

- *Yukon Income Tax Act* s. 21 (individuals), s. 17 (corporations) — as amended through 2025
- Personal Income Tax Administration Agreement between Canada, Yukon, and each self-governing Yukon First Nation
- Final Agreements and Self-Government Agreements of the 11 self-governing Yukon First Nations

**Refer all FNTC computations to a credentialed reviewer.** The interaction with the federal abatement, the attribution rules, and the specific terms of each First Nation's Self-Government Agreement make this an area where the conservative default is **always refer**, never auto-compute.

## 4. Yukon Small Business Investment Tax Credit (SBITC)

The Yukon SBITC encourages investment in eligible Yukon-based small businesses by individual Yukon-resident investors.

### Parameters (2025)

- **Rate:** 25% of qualifying investment
- **Annual cap per investor:** $25,000 credit (i.e., $100,000 of qualifying investment)
- **Type:** Non-refundable (carryforward 7 years, carryback 3 years)
- **Eligible investment:** Equity in an eligible Yukon small business corporation registered with the Yukon Department of Economic Development; certificate issued
- **Eligible investor:** Yukon resident individual at the time of investment

### Workflow

1. Investor receives a **Yukon SBITC certificate** from the Department of Economic Development.
2. Certificate number and credit amount entered on Form YT479.
3. Credit applied against Yukon tax payable on Form YT428 (after the FNTC and most other non-refundables).
4. Unused balance carried forward / back as above.

## 5. Yukon Research and Development Tax Credit

A refundable credit available to both individuals and corporations carrying on Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) work in Yukon, **in addition to** the federal SR&ED ITC.

### Parameters (2025)

- **General rate:** 15% of eligible Yukon SR&ED expenditures
- **Enhanced rate:** 20% on the portion of expenditures paid to a Yukon university or college
- **Type:** Refundable (paid out even if no tax owing)
- **Coordination:** Computed on Yukon-source portion; federal SR&ED ITC is computed separately on Schedule T661 + Schedule 31

### Workflow

1. Complete federal Form T661 (SR&ED claim) and Schedule 31 first.
2. Identify the Yukon-source portion of eligible expenditures.
3. Apply the 15% / 20% rate.
4. Claim the refundable credit on the corporate T2 (Schedule 443) or individual YT479.

---

## 6. Yukon Manufacturing and Processing Profits Tax Credit

This is a **statutory rate reduction**, not a discrete credit line. Under YITA s. 17.1, M&P profits earned in Yukon are taxed at **2.5%** rather than the general 12%, mirroring the federal M&P rate reduction.

- Applies to **non-CCPC** income and to CCPC income above the $500,000 SBD limit when classified as M&P profit
- M&P determination follows the federal rules: Schedule 27 (Calculation of Canadian Manufacturing and Processing Profits Deduction)
- Reported on T2 Schedule 5 (provincial tax) with M&P portion identified
- Combined federal-Yukon rate on M&P profit: 15% federal + 2.5% Yukon = **17.5%**

---

## 7. Yukon Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (YMETC)

Mining is the single largest private-sector industry in Yukon. The YMETC supports **grassroots** mineral exploration on Yukon-staked claims.

### Parameters (2025)

- **Rate:** 25% of eligible Yukon-source grassroots mineral exploration expenses (i.e., pre-feasibility, surface exploration)
- **Type:** Non-refundable for both individuals and corporations; carryforward 10 years
- **Eligible expenditures:** Defined by reference to the federal Canadian Exploration Expense (CEE) under ITA s. 66.1, but restricted to grassroots-stage Yukon-source amounts
- **Coordination:** **In addition to** the federal Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) at 30% where applicable, and the federal Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (METC) at 15% otherwise

### Flow-through share interaction

The YMETC is typically claimed by an **investor** receiving a flow-through share renunciation of eligible CEE from a Yukon junior mining company. Reported on:

- **Individual:** Form T1229 (federal flow-through) + Form YT479 line for YMETC
- **Corporate:** Schedule 443

---

## 8. Yukon Children's Fitness Tax Credit

A refundable provincial credit (Yukon retained this credit after the federal version was eliminated in 2017).

- **Maximum eligible expense:** $1,000 per child under 16 (under 18 if eligible for disability tax credit)
- **Refundable rate:** Yukon lowest tax bracket rate (6.4% for 2025)
- **Maximum refundable credit:** $1,000 × 6.4% = **$64 per child**; plus a **$500 supplement** for children eligible for the disability tax credit (total expense allowance)
- Claimed on Form YT479

---

## 9. Yukon Corporate Tax — 12% / 0% structure

Yukon operates **the most generous CIT rate structure in Canada** for small CCPCs.

### 2025 rates

| Income type | Federal | Yukon | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small business income (CCPC, ≤ $500k active) | 9% | **0%** | **9%** |
| General active business income | 15% | 12% | 27% |
| M&P profits | 15% | 2.5% | 17.5% |
| Investment income (CCPC) | 38.67% (incl. refundable Part I) | 12% | up to 50.67% before RDTOH |

### Key implications

- A Yukon CCPC with $500,000 of active business income pays only **$45,000 in combined CIT** ($500,000 × 9%), compared to e.g. $63,500 in Ontario (12.2% combined) or $50,000 in BC (10%).
- The 0% rate is conditioned on standard SBD requirements: CCPC status, active business income, associated-group $500k limit, passive-income grind under ITA s. 125(5.1) where applicable.

## 10. Form YT428 — personal credit form

Form YT428 (Yukon Tax) and its companion Form YT479 (Yukon Credits) are filed as part of the T1 General. Key lines for 2025:

| Form | Line | Credit |
|---|---|---|
| YT428 | 58040–58400 | Basic personal amount, age, spouse, eligible dependant, etc. (mirror federal where harmonized) |
| YT428 | (FNTC line) | Yukon First Nations Tax Credit |
| YT428 | (Political contribution) | Political contribution credit |
| YT479 | 63855 | Yukon Children's Fitness Credit (refundable) |
| YT479 | (SBITC line) | Small Business Investment Tax Credit |
| YT479 | (YMETC line) | Mineral Exploration Tax Credit |
| YT479 | (R&D line) | Yukon R&D Tax Credit (refundable, individual) |

Yukon harmonizes most personal non-refundable credit definitions with the federal T1 schedule, including the basic personal amount mechanism — but applies them at **Yukon rates** (lowest bracket 6.4%, top bracket 15% for 2025).

## 11. Worked example — Yukon CCPC, Whitehorse, $400k active income

**Facts.** Whitehorse Tech Ltd. is a Yukon-incorporated CCPC, 100% owned by a Yukon-resident individual. 2025 calendar year. Active business income $400,000. No associated corporations. No passive income grind. Not engaged in M&P.

**Step 1 — Federal tax.**
- Federal general rate: 15%
- Federal SBD: 19% rate reduction on first $500k → effective 9%
- $400,000 × 9% = **$36,000 federal Part I tax**

**Step 2 — Yukon tax.**
- Yukon small business rate on active income ≤ $500k: **0%**
- $400,000 × 0% = **$0 Yukon CIT**

**Step 3 — Combined.**
- Total CIT: **$36,000** on $400,000 of active business income
- Combined effective rate: **9.00%**

**Step 4 — Comparison.**
- Same facts in Ontario: $400,000 × 12.2% combined = $48,800 (Yukon saves $12,800)
- Same facts in BC: $400,000 × 11.0% combined = $44,000 (Yukon saves $8,000)
- Same facts in Saskatchewan (1% SB rate): $400,000 × 10% combined = $40,000 (Yukon saves $4,000)

**Reviewer note.** The 0% Yukon SBD rate is a powerful incentive for genuine Yukon-resident operating businesses. It does **not** by itself justify a Yukon incorporation for a business operated elsewhere — the corporation must have a permanent establishment in Yukon under federal Reg. 400, and provincial allocation under Schedule 5 applies. Sham residency / mailbox PE schemes will be reassessed.

---

## 12. Conservative defaults

- **Default the FNTC to 'refer to reviewer'** — never auto-compute without the citizenship determination, Settlement Land attribution, and confirmation of which Self-Government Agreement applies.
- Default SBITC to **uncertified** until the Yukon Department of Economic Development certificate number is in hand.
- Default YMETC eligibility to **grassroots only** — if the work is past pre-feasibility, refuse and refer.
- Default R&D credit Yukon-source allocation to the **conservative attribution** (lesser of T661 expenditures and Yukon-PE expenditures).
- Default provincial allocation (Schedule 5) to the **federal Reg. 400 result** — do not optimize.
- If the taxpayer was a YT resident for **less than the full year**, refuse and refer.
