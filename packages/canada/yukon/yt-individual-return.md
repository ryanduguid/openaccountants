### Yukon Tax Rates (2025, indexed from 2024)

| Taxable Income (CAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 57,375 | 6.40% |
| 57,376 -- 114,750 | 9.00% |
| 114,751 -- 177,882 | 10.90% |
| 177,883 -- 500,000 | 12.80% |
| 500,001+ | 15.00% |

Yukon parallels the federal brackets except the top bracket starts at $500,000 (not federal level).

### Basic Personal Amount (BPA)

Yukon's BPA tracks the federal enhanced BPA. For 2025, BPA is approximately $16,129 (federal indexed; verify against CRA published indexation tables).

### Yukon-specific credits

| Credit | Notes |
|---|---|
| Yukon First Nations Income Tax Credit | For status Indians resident on settlement land of a Yukon First Nation that has a Final Agreement Income Tax Act. Effectively cedes territorial tax to the First Nation. |
| Pioneer Utility Grant | Refundable. Seniors 65+ resident in Yukon. Not part of YT428 itself but flows through the territorial system. |
| Yukon Children's Fitness Tax Credit | Up to $1,000 per child; non-refundable at lowest bracket rate. |
| Yukon Small Business Investment Tax Credit | 25% of eligible investment, up to $25,000/year, with carryforward. Most relevant for corporate but individuals with eligible investments may claim. |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown territory | Do not apply this skill |
| Status Indian on settlement land | Escalate (FN tax may apply instead) |
| Part-year resident | Escalate |
| Unknown bracket year | 2025 indexed figures |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- territory of residence on Dec 31 (must be Yukon), federal taxable income (T1 line 26000), federal net income.

**Recommended** -- marital status, spouse income, children, status Indian indicator, settlement land status, age (for Pioneer Utility Grant).

**Ideal** -- complete T1 data, prior YT428, First Nation membership status, copy of YT479.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-YT-1 -- Not Yukon resident.** "Province/territory is not Yukon on December 31. This skill only applies to Yukon residents."

**R-YT-2 -- Corporations/trusts.** "Individual sole proprietors only."

**R-YT-3 -- Part-year resident.** "Escalate. Apply YT rates only to the period the taxpayer was Yukon-resident; another province may tax the balance."

**R-YT-4 -- Status Indian on Yukon First Nation settlement land.** "Escalate. A Yukon First Nation with a Final Agreement Income Tax Act may have first-priority taxing right; the Yukon First Nations Income Tax Credit reduces YT tax to nil for that income."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

---

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Low Income

**Input:** Taxable income $20,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- Gross Yukon tax: $20,000 × 6.40% = $1,280.00
- BPA credit: $16,129 × 6.40% = $1,032.26
- Basic territorial tax: $247.74

### Example 2 -- Mid-Range

**Input:** Taxable income $90,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $57,375 at 6.40% = $3,672.00
- $32,625 at 9.00% = $2,936.25
- Gross Yukon tax: $6,608.25
- BPA credit: $1,032.26
- Basic territorial tax: $5,575.99

### Example 3 -- High Income

**Input:** Taxable income $600,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $57,375 at 6.40% = $3,672.00
- $57,375 at 9.00% = $5,163.75
- $63,132 at 10.90% = $6,881.39
- $322,118 at 12.80% = $41,231.10
- $100,000 at 15.00% = $15,000.00
- Gross Yukon tax: $71,948.24
- BPA credit: $1,032.26
- Basic territorial tax: $70,915.98

### Example 4 -- Status Indian on Yukon FN Settlement Land

**Input:** Status Indian under the Indian Act, resident on settlement land of a Yukon First Nation with a Final Agreement Income Tax Act, employment income $80,000 earned on settlement land.

**Treatment:**
- Income may be exempt from federal tax under s. 87 Indian Act.
- Yukon First Nation income tax (FN Final Agreement) and Yukon First Nations Income Tax Credit interact: territorial tax is effectively transferred to the FN.
- **Escalate to a Yukon CPA familiar with FN Final Agreement Income Tax Acts.**

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### EC-YT-1: Carbon Rebate

The federal carbon rebate (formerly Climate Action Incentive) for Yukon residents is delivered through the Yukon Government Carbon Price Rebate. This is delivered separately from YT428.

### EC-YT-2: Yukon Small Business Investment Tax Credit (YSBITC)

Individuals with eligible Yukon investments may claim 25% credit (max $25,000/yr). Non-refundable but carries forward 7 years and back 3. Coordinate with federal investment credits to avoid double benefit.

### EC-YT-3: Mining royalties

If the taxpayer's T2125 includes Yukon mining or placer claim income, escalate — Yukon mining royalties and the Yukon-specific exploration tax credit have complex interactions.
