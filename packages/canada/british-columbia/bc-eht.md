# British Columbia — Employer Health Tax (EHT) — Skill v1.0

The BC Employer Health Tax (EHT) is a payroll-based tax imposed on employers under the
**Employer Health Tax Act, SBC 2018, c. 42**. It is administered by the BC Ministry of
Finance and filed/paid through the **eTaxBC** portal. It replaced the per-employee
Medical Services Plan (MSP) premiums that BC eliminated effective January 1, 2020.

**Important — do not confuse with Ontario EHT.** Ontario's EHT (Employer Health Tax Act,
RSO 1990, c. E.11) has a $1,000,000 exemption with a 1.95% top rate and is filed with
the Ontario Ministry of Finance. BC's EHT shares the top rate but has different
thresholds, a different sliding-scale formula, a different return (eTaxBC), and a
different instalment rule. Always confirm the province before computing or filing.

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### 2.1 Required inputs

To compute and file BC EHT, gather:

1. **Total BC remuneration** for the calendar year — gross wages, salaries, bonuses,
   commissions, taxable benefits (T4 Box 14 equivalent), vacation pay, taxable
   allowances, and employer-paid stock option benefits for **employees who report
   for work at a permanent establishment in BC** (or are paid from BC if no PE).
2. **Associated-employer group structure** — a list of all corporations and entities
   under common control (within the meaning of s. 256 ITA, applied for EHT
   purposes) so the $1M exemption can be allocated.
3. **Charitable or non-profit status** — if applicable, evidence of registration
   (CRA registered charity number) and a list of qualifying locations.
4. **Prior-year EHT liability** — to determine whether quarterly instalments are
   required in the current year.
5. **eTaxBC enrolment** — the employer's BC EHT account number and eTaxBC logon
   credentials, or confirmation that registration is still pending.

### 2.2 Refusal catalogue — out of scope for v1.0

Refuse and escalate to a credentialed BC tax practitioner if any of the following apply:

- **R-BC-EHT-1**: Stock-option benefits where the §7 ITA timing (exercise vs.
  acquisition vs. CCPC deferral) is contested.
- **R-BC-EHT-2**: Cross-border or non-resident employees where the BC permanent
  establishment test under s. 400 Reg. is in doubt.
- **R-BC-EHT-3**: Anti-avoidance issues under s. 32 of the EHT Act (the
  general anti-avoidance rule for EHT).
- **R-BC-EHT-4**: Audit, reassessment, or objection work — refer to a BC tax lawyer
  or designated practitioner.
- **R-BC-EHT-5**: Bankruptcy, receivership, or wind-up year returns where partial-year
  proration of the exemption is required.
- **R-BC-EHT-6**: Successor-employer rules where the exemption has already been used
  by a predecessor in the same calendar year.

---

## 3. Rate structure (2024 and later calendar years)

The Employer Health Tax Act, ss. 8–10, sets a three-tier structure for non-charitable
employers based on **total BC remuneration** for the calendar year:

### 3.1 Tier 1 — Fully exempt

- BC remuneration **≤ $1,000,000** → **EHT = $0**.
- No return required if the employer is not registered. Registration is mandatory only
  once BC remuneration exceeds the threshold (or once instalments are triggered).

### 3.2 Tier 2 — Notch / sliding scale

- BC remuneration **between $1,000,001 and $1,500,000**.
- Formula: **EHT = 5.85% × (BC remuneration − $1,000,000)**.
- This produces an effective rate that **rises from 0% at $1,000,000 to 1.95% at
  $1,500,000**, with a marginal rate of 5.85% inside the notch. The marginal rate of
  5.85% over the $500,000 notch is the mechanism that delivers the often-quoted
  **2.925% effective rate** at the top of the notch (i.e., $1,500,000 × 1.95%
  ≈ $29,250, which equals 5.85% × $500,000).

### 3.3 Tier 3 — Flat rate

- BC remuneration **> $1,500,000**.
- Formula: **EHT = 1.95% × full BC remuneration** (no exemption applied; the
  exemption is fully phased out at this level).

### 3.4 Charity / non-profit schedule (s. 9 of the Act)

Registered charities and qualifying non-profit employers compute EHT **per qualifying
location** with a higher exemption:

- BC remuneration **≤ $1,500,000** per location → exempt.
- BC remuneration **$1,500,001 – $4,500,000** per location → 2.925% × (remuneration −
  $1,500,000).
- BC remuneration **> $4,500,000** per location → 1.95% × full remuneration.

Each qualifying location is treated separately. This is the principal structural
difference from the regular-employer schedule.

## 4. Exemption uplift — 2024 budget change

The exemption threshold for regular employers was **raised from $500,000 to
$1,000,000** for the 2024 and later calendar years, and the notch band was extended
from $500,001–$1,500,000 to **$1,000,001–$1,500,000**, as announced in the BC Budget
2024 (Budget and Fiscal Plan 2024/25 – 2026/27, tabled February 22, 2024) and enacted
through the Budget Measures Implementation Act, 2024.

**Effect**: many small BC employers that paid EHT in 2023 are fully exempt from 2024
onward. The change does **not** affect the top-tier 1.95% rate or the $1.5M flat-rate
threshold. The charity schedule was not changed by Budget 2024.

When preparing a 2024 or 2025 return, do not use pre-2024 thresholds. When preparing
a 2023 return (e.g., a late filing or amendment), use the **$500,000 exemption** and
the **$500,001 – $1,500,000** notch.

## 5. Calculation — what counts as BC remuneration

BC remuneration is defined in s. 1 of the EHT Act and largely tracks the federal
T4 reporting concept. It includes:

- Gross wages, salaries, and commissions paid in the calendar year.
- Bonuses and incentive pay.
- Vacation pay, statutory holiday pay, and termination/severance pay (the cash
  portions; retiring allowances rolled into RRSPs are excluded to the extent
  excluded for T4 purposes).
- Taxable benefits reported on T4 — including the standby charge and operating
  benefit, group term life insurance over $25,000, employer-paid group health
  premiums treated as taxable, and most non-cash benefits.
- Employer contributions to an Employee Profit Sharing Plan (EPSP).
- Stock-option benefits under §7 ITA (timing follows the federal rules).
- Directors' fees paid to BC-resident directors.

It **excludes**:

- Pension contributions to a registered pension plan (RPP).
- Employer contributions to an RRSP that are not taxable to the employee in the
  year (rare — most employer RRSP contributions are taxable and therefore included).
- Reimbursements of bona fide business expenses.
- Most non-taxable allowances (e.g., reasonable per-kilometre motor-vehicle
  allowances within the CRA prescribed rate).
- Remuneration paid to employees who do not report for work at a BC permanent
  establishment and are not paid from a BC PE.

**Allocation rule** — when an employee reports for work at PEs in more than one
province during the year, allocate remuneration to BC on the same basis as federal
Regulation 102 source-deduction allocation: by working days at each PE, or by a
reasonable method if multiple PEs are used.

## 6. Filing — eTaxBC return and instalments

### 6.1 Annual return

- The annual EHT return is filed electronically through **eTaxBC**. There is no
  paper return for regular employers; charities may file by paper on request.
- **Due date: March 31** of the year following the calendar year (so the 2025
  return is due **March 31, 2026**).
- Late filing penalty: greater of $100 and 5% of the unpaid balance, plus 1% per
  full month for up to 12 months (s. 50 of the Act).
- Interest accrues on unpaid amounts at the BC prescribed rate, compounded daily.

### 6.2 Quarterly instalments

If the **prior calendar year's EHT exceeded $2,925**, the employer must remit
quarterly instalments in the current year. Each instalment equals one-quarter of the
lesser of:

- The prior year's EHT, or
- An estimate of the current year's EHT (if the employer chooses the current-year
  estimate method and accepts the risk of a deficiency interest charge).

**Instalment due dates**:

- Q1: **June 15**
- Q2: **September 15**
- Q3: **December 15**
- Final balance: **March 31** with the annual return.

An employer below the $2,925 prior-year threshold pays the full liability with the
annual return; no instalments are required.

### 6.3 Registration

Registration through eTaxBC is required once BC remuneration exceeds the exemption
threshold for the year, or once instalments are triggered. Late registration does
not waive the obligation to file and pay for the year in which the threshold was
first exceeded.

---

## 7. Charities and non-profits

A "qualifying charity" for EHT is a registered charity under s. 248(1) ITA. A
"qualifying non-profit" is an entity described in paragraph 149(1)(l) ITA. For these
employers:

- The exemption is **$1,500,000 per qualifying location** (s. 9 of the EHT Act).
- A "qualifying location" is a permanent establishment of the charity in BC that has
  at least one employee reporting for work there in the year.
- A charity with three BC locations and $2M of remuneration spread across them (say,
  $700k / $700k / $600k) is **fully exempt** because each location is under $1.5M.
- The same charity with $4M at a single location pays EHT on the band $1.5M–$4M at
  2.925%, plus the standard rules above $4.5M.

This per-location treatment is the principal reason charities are addressed by a
separate schedule rather than the regular sliding scale.

---

## 8. Multi-employer groups — associated employers

Under s. 11 of the EHT Act, **associated employers must share a single $1,000,000
exemption** for the calendar year. "Associated" is defined by reference to s. 256
ITA (with EHT-specific modifications), so the federal CCPC small-business-deduction
sharing concept is the relevant starting point.

Mechanics:

1. The associated group files **Schedule B (Allocation of Exemption Amount Among
   Associated Employers)** with eTaxBC, allocating the $1,000,000 across members.
2. Any unallocated amount is lost; the allocation cannot exceed $1,000,000 in
   aggregate.
3. If members fail to file an allocation, the Minister may allocate $0 to each
   member by default, exposing the entire group to tax from the first dollar of
   payroll.
4. The notch and flat-rate thresholds are applied to the **combined** BC remuneration
   of the group only for purposes of determining which schedule applies; the tax
   itself is computed entity-by-entity using each member's allocated exemption.

For charity groups, each member's per-location $1.5M exemption is not aggregated; the
associated-employer rule applies only to the regular-employer schedule.

## 9. Historical context — replacement of MSP premiums

Until December 31, 2019, BC funded a significant portion of provincial health care
through **MSP premiums** — a flat per-person monthly premium paid mostly by
individuals, with many employers paying the premium as a taxable benefit.

The 2018 BC Budget announced a two-step transition:

- **January 1, 2018** — MSP premiums halved.
- **January 1, 2019** — EHT introduced at the rates above (with the original $500k
  exemption).
- **January 1, 2020** — MSP premiums eliminated entirely.

For the **2019 calendar year only**, employers paid both half-rate MSP and the new
EHT, which is why 2019 transition workpapers often look anomalous on review.

From 2020 forward, EHT is the only BC health-care payroll tax. The 2024 exemption
uplift to $1,000,000 is the most recent material change.

## 10. Worked example — Vancouver tech company, $2,000,000 payroll

**Facts**:

- A Vancouver-based software company, sole BC permanent establishment.
- Calendar 2025 total BC remuneration: **$2,000,000** (T4 Box 14 plus taxable
  benefits, with stock-option benefits of $150,000 under §7 ITA included).
- Not associated with any other employer.
- Not a charity.
- Prior-year (2024) EHT liability: $9,750 (so instalments are required in 2025).

**Step 1 — Determine the schedule.**

$2,000,000 > $1,500,000 → Tier 3 (flat-rate band).

**Step 2 — Compute the tax.**

EHT = 1.95% × $2,000,000 = **$39,000**.

**Step 3 — Instalments.**

Prior-year EHT ($9,750) > $2,925 → quarterly instalments are required. Using the
prior-year safe-harbour:

- June 15, 2025: $2,437.50
- September 15, 2025: $2,437.50
- December 15, 2025: $2,437.50

Total instalments paid by year-end: $7,312.50.

**Step 4 — Final balance.**

Filed with the annual return on March 31, 2026:

Balance owing = $39,000 − $7,312.50 = **$31,687.50**.

**Step 5 — Reasonableness check.**

At $2M flat-band payroll the effective rate is 1.95%. Output of $39,000 matches
1.95% × $2,000,000. No reconciliation difference.

## 11. Conservative defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, apply the following defaults and flag them in the
reviewer notes:

1. **Permanent establishment** — if it is unclear whether an employee's remuneration
   is BC remuneration, default to **including** it and flag for review.
2. **Stock-option benefits** — default to the §7 ITA inclusion year shown on the T4;
   do not override the federal timing.
3. **Associated employers** — if the corporate group structure is unclear, default to
   **$0 allocated exemption** for the entity being prepared and flag for review.
   Do not assume an exemption is available without confirming the allocation.
4. **Charity status** — do not apply the charity schedule unless the entity has
   confirmed registered-charity or paragraph 149(1)(l) status. Default to the
   regular schedule.
5. **Instalment requirement** — if the prior-year liability is not in hand, assume
   instalments are required if the current-year projection exceeds $2,925.
6. **Late registration** — if registration was late, compute tax from the first
   dollar over the threshold and flag the late-filing penalty exposure.
7. **2023 vs. 2024+ thresholds** — confirm the calendar year before selecting the
   exemption amount; never apply the $1,000,000 threshold to a pre-2024 year.
