# Alberta — Corporate Income Tax — Skill v1.0

> **Scope:** Alberta provincial corporate income tax (Alberta Corporate Tax Act, RSA 2000, c A-15) for the 2025 tax year. ALWAYS load this skill alongside the federal T2 skill — Alberta is a non-agreeing province for corporate tax and runs its own AT1 system in parallel with the federal T2.

## 1. Quick reference — Alberta vs federal combined CIT

| Income type | Federal | Alberta | **Combined** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General active business income** | 15% | **8%** | **23%** |
| **SBD income** (first $500,000 active business income, CCPC) | 9% | **2%** | **11%** |
| **Investment income (CCPC, non-active)** | 38.67% (incl. 10.67% refundable) | 8% | 46.67% |
| **M&P income** (no separate AB rate) | 15% | 8% | 23% |

Alberta has the **lowest general provincial corporate income tax rate in Canada** following the Job Creation Tax Cut (Bill 3, 2019), which reduced the general rate from 12% to 8% in four annual 1-point steps culminating July 1, 2020 — accelerated from the original 2022 schedule.

**Comparable provinces (2025 general rate):**
- Alberta: 8%
- BC: 12%
- Saskatchewan: 12%
- Manitoba: 12%
- Ontario: 11.5%
- Quebec: 11.5%

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### Required inputs
1. **Permanent establishment (PE)** in Alberta — confirmed via federal Schedule 5 allocation
2. **Alberta taxable income allocation** — % of taxable income earned in Alberta (Schedule 5, federal T2)
3. **Active business income (ABI)** vs aggregate investment income (AAII) split
4. **CCPC status** for the entire tax year
5. **Associated corporation group** — for SBD limit sharing
6. **Federal SR&ED qualified expenditures** — feeds Alberta IEG computation
7. **Fiscal year-end (FYE)** date
8. **Alberta Corporate Account Number (CAN)** — 9 or 10-digit AB TRA identifier

### Refusal catalogue (out of scope — escalate to credentialed Alberta tax practitioner)
- **R-AB-CIT-1**: Multi-provincial PE allocation with disputed Schedule 5 attribution
- **R-AB-CIT-2**: Non-resident corporation carrying on business in Alberta (Part XIV branch tax interaction)
- **R-AB-CIT-3**: Insurance corporations, banks, and financial institutions (special AT1 schedules)
- **R-AB-CIT-4**: Crown corporations, exempt entities under s.35 of the Act
- **R-AB-CIT-5**: Mutual fund corporations, mortgage investment corporations
- **R-AB-CIT-6**: Reorganizations involving Alberta-allocated assets (s.85, s.86, s.87 with cross-border consequences)

## 3. General rate — 8% (Job Creation Tax Cut)

The **general corporate income tax rate** under s.21 of the Alberta Corporate Tax Act is **8%** for tax years ending on or after July 1, 2020, and remains **8% for the 2025 tax year**.

### Rate history (Job Creation Tax Cut, Bill 3, 2019)
| Effective date | General rate |
|---|---|
| Before July 1, 2019 | 12% |
| July 1, 2019 | 11% |
| January 1, 2020 | 10% |
| July 1, 2020 | **8%** (accelerated from the originally planned 2022) |
| 2025 | **8%** (current) |

**Combined federal + Alberta general rate: 23%** (15% federal + 8% AB).

### Straddling tax years
A corporation with a fiscal year straddling a rate change date must prorate. For 2025, the rate has been stable at 8% since July 1, 2020, so no proration applies to any FYE in 2025.

---

## 4. Small Business Deduction (SBD) — 2% Alberta rate

Alberta provides a **small business deduction** under s.22 of the Alberta Corporate Tax Act on the **first $500,000 of active business income** of a **Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC)**.

### Effective rates
- **Alberta SBD rate: 2%** (general rate of 8% minus SBD of 6%)
- **Federal SBD rate: 9%** (general rate of 15% minus federal SBD of 6%)
- **Combined federal + AB SBD rate: 11%** on first $500,000 ABI

### Business limit grind
- **Taxable capital employed in Canada (TCEC) grind**: Alberta mirrors the **federal grind** — the $500,000 business limit is reduced where TCEC of the associated group exceeds $10M, fully phased out at $50M (consistent with the 2024+ federal expansion from the prior $10M-$15M phase-out band).
- **Passive investment income grind**: Alberta mirrors the federal AAII grind under ITA s.125(5.1) — every $1 of AAII over $50,000 reduces the SBD business limit by $5, fully eliminated at $150,000 AAII.
- **Associated corporations** must share the $500,000 business limit via AB Schedule 3 (mirrors federal T2 Schedule 23 allocation).

### Specified Investment Business (SIB) and Personal Services Business (PSB)
- **SIB income** does not qualify for the SBD; taxed at 8% Alberta general rate (plus federal refundable rates on investment income).
- **PSB income** is excluded from the SBD by ITA s.125(7); Alberta follows. PSB also faces the federal 5% additional tax under ITA s.123.5 — Alberta does **not** apply an additional provincial PSB surtax.

---

## 5. AT1 return — Alberta's standalone corporate tax return

Alberta is one of **three non-agreeing provinces for corporate tax** (along with Quebec and — for the period before 2010 — Ontario, which has since integrated). Corporations with a PE in Alberta file:

- **Federal T2** with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), AND
- **AT1 — Alberta Corporate Income Tax Return** with **Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (TRA)**

> Note: Alberta participates in the federal–provincial Tax Collection Agreement (TCA) for **individuals** (CRA administers the AB personal income tax under the same T1), but **not for corporations**. The AT1 system is administered directly by TRA at Alberta Treasury Board and Finance.

### AT1 core schedules (2025)
| Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **AT1 page 1** | Identification, FYE, AB allocation %, tax payable |
| **AT1 Schedule 1** | Alberta small business deduction calculation |
| **AT1 Schedule 2** | Alberta foreign investment income tax credit (limited) |
| **AT1 Schedule 4** | Alberta foreign tax credit on business income |
| **AT1 Schedule 9** | Listed Personal Property and other capital gains |
| **AT1 Schedule 10** | Alberta loss carry-forward continuity (non-capital, net capital, restricted farm) |
| **AT1 Schedule 12** | Income/loss reconciliation to federal Schedule 1 |
| **AT1 Schedule 13** | Alberta Innovation Employment Grant (IEG) |
| **AT1 Schedule 14** | Cumulative eligible capital (CEC) — historical only; replaced by Class 14.1 |
| **AT1 Schedule 18** | Allocation of Alberta income among PEs |
| **AT1 Schedule 21** | Calculation of Alberta tax payable |
| **AT1 Schedule 29** | Innovation Employment Grant — detailed eligible expenditures |

### Filing channel
- **Net File AT1** via TRA's online portal (mandatory for most corporations)
- **Tax preparer software**: CCH iFirm Taxprep, Wolters Kluwer Cantax, Intuit ProFile, TaxCycle — all support AT1 e-filing
- **Paper filing** permitted only for corporations exempt from e-filing (very rare exceptions)

### Account number
- Corporations must register for an **Alberta Corporate Account Number (CAN)** with TRA before first filing
- Registration: TRA Client Self-Service (TRACS) portal

---

## 6. Filing deadlines

| Item | Deadline |
|---|---|
| **AT1 return filing** | **6 months after FYE** (same as federal T2) |
| **AT1 tax payment** | **2 months after FYE** (CCPCs claiming SBD: 3 months after FYE — mirrors federal) |
| **Instalments** | Monthly instalments for corporations with prior-year AB tax over $2,000; quarterly available for eligible CCPCs (mirrors federal eligibility) |
| **Notice of objection** | 90 days from Notice of (Re)assessment |
| **Record retention** | 6 years from end of last tax year to which the records relate |

### Late filing penalties (Alberta TRA)
- **5% of unpaid tax** at filing deadline, plus
- **1% per complete month** of continuing failure, up to **12 months**
- **Doubled** for repeat offenders (prior late-filing penalty in any of the 3 preceding tax years and TRA demand to file): 10% + 2%/month up to 20 months
- **Interest** on unpaid tax accrues from balance-due date at the TRA-prescribed rate (set quarterly; aligned roughly with federal CRA prescribed rate plus a margin)

---

## 7. Alberta Investor Tax Credit (AITC) — historical

The **AITC** was a non-refundable 30% tax credit for investments in eligible Alberta small businesses (capped at $60,000/investor/year and $5M per business lifetime), available 2017–2019.

- **Status**: **Eliminated effective March 30, 2020** by the UCP government (Bill 20, 2019)
- **Grandfathered claims**: Credits earned 2017–2019 retain a **4-year carry-forward** (last carry-forward window expired with 2023 tax year for the final 2019 vintage)
- **2025 action**: Check for any unused AITC carry-forward on prior AT1 — for FYEs in 2025, the 2019-vintage carry-forward has expired; only confirm there is nothing inadvertently still being claimed.

---

## 8. Capital Investment Tax Credit (CITC) — wound down

The **CITC** was a 10% non-refundable tax credit for capital investment in manufacturing, processing, and tourism infrastructure (eligible expenditure $1M minimum, credit cap $5M per project).

- **Status**: **Program wound down in 2020**; no new applications accepted.
- **Grandfathered claims**: Credits earned for approved projects retain a **10-year carry-forward**.
- **2025 action**: Check the prior AT1 for any CITC carry-forward balance and confirm continued claim eligibility against TRA approval letter.

---

## 9. Innovation Employment Grant (IEG) — refundable R&D credit

The **IEG** is Alberta's refundable R&D tax credit, introduced effective **January 1, 2021** to partially replace the wound-down Alberta SR&ED tax credit (which was eliminated effective January 1, 2020).

### Rate structure (s.26.6 Alberta Corporate Tax Act)
| Tier | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| **Base credit** | **8%** | First **$4M** of eligible R&D expenditures (in Alberta) |
| **Incremental credit** | **20%** | Expenditures **above the prior 2-year average** R&D spend, up to the $4M cap |

### Eligibility
- Corporation with **PE in Alberta** at any time in the tax year
- Eligible expenditures = **federal SR&ED qualified expenditures** (per ITA s.37 and Regulation 2900) **incurred in Alberta**
- **Refundable**: Excess credit over Alberta tax payable refunded to the corporation (no carry-forward needed)

### Expenditure cap
- The **$4M expenditure cap** is shared among **associated corporations**
- The cap is **prorated** for short tax years

### Claim mechanics
- File **AT1 Schedule 29** (detailed eligible expenditures, allocation among associated group)
- File **AT1 Schedule 13** (summary, integration with AT1 tax payable)
- Reconciles to **federal T661** (SR&ED claim) line entries restricted to Alberta-located expenditures

### Interaction with federal SR&ED
- The IEG is **separate from federal SR&ED ITC** — both can be claimed on the same eligible expenditure pool (where Alberta-located)
- The IEG itself is **taxable income** for federal purposes in the year received (ITA s.12(1)(x); included on federal T2 Schedule 1)
- Alberta does not require an offsetting addback (avoids double-taxing the grant in AB)

---

## 10. Foreign investment income — no additional AAII refundable tax in Alberta

Some provinces (e.g., **Saskatchewan** with its 2% additional refundable tax on AAII) apply a **provincial refundable tax on aggregate investment income (AAII)** of CCPCs mirroring the federal 10.67% Part I refundable tax under ITA s.123.3.

**Alberta does NOT have an additional provincial refundable tax on AAII.** Investment income of an Alberta CCPC is taxed at:
- **Federal**: 38.67% (28% Part I + 10.67% additional refundable Part I)
- **Alberta**: **8% only** (general rate; no surtax, no AAII supplement)
- **Combined**: 46.67%

Federal RDTOH (refundable dividend tax on hand) mechanics apply at the federal level only; **Alberta has no provincial RDTOH equivalent**. Refundable mechanics operate solely through CRA on the federal Part I refundable component.

## 11. Worked example — Calgary tech CCPC

### Facts
- **Corporation**: Cascade Code Inc., a CCPC incorporated in Alberta, FYE December 31, 2025
- **Single PE**: Calgary, Alberta (100% Alberta allocation per federal Schedule 5)
- **Gross revenue**: $2,000,000 (Canadian-source SaaS development services)
- **Net income for tax purposes (line 300, federal T2)**: $400,000
- **Active business income (ABI)**: $300,000 (after federal Schedule 7 calculation)
- **Investment income**: $20,000 (interest on cash reserves)
- **Taxable capital employed in Canada (TCEC)**: $3,200,000 (below $10M — no TCEC grind)
- **Associated corporations**: none
- **SR&ED qualified expenditures (Alberta)**: $250,000 (current-year)
- **Prior 2-year average Alberta R&D spend**: $180,000

### Step 1 — Federal T2 (for context)
- ABI eligible for SBD: $300,000 (all under $500,000 limit, no grind)
- Federal SBD-rate tax: $300,000 × 9% = **$27,000**
- Federal general-rate tax on remaining $100,000 ($400,000 − $300,000 ABI): $100,000 × 15% = **$15,000**
- Federal Part I refundable on investment income: not separately computed here; subsumed in T2 mechanics
- **Federal tax (Part I, simplified)**: ~$42,000 before credits

### Step 2 — Alberta AT1 — Schedule 21 tax payable
- **Alberta taxable income**: $400,000 (100% Alberta allocation)
- **SBD-rate portion** (matches federal SBD claim): $300,000 × **2%** = **$6,000**
- **General-rate portion**: $100,000 × **8%** = **$8,000**
- **Alberta tax before credits**: **$14,000**

### Step 3 — Innovation Employment Grant (AT1 Schedule 13 + 29)
- Eligible AB SR&ED expenditures: $250,000
- Prior 2-year average: $180,000
- **Base credit** (8% on first $4M of $250,000): $250,000 × 8% = **$20,000**
- **Incremental credit** (20% on amount above prior 2-yr avg, up to $4M cap):
  - Incremental: $250,000 − $180,000 = $70,000
  - 20% × $70,000 = **$14,000**
- **Total IEG**: $20,000 + $14,000 = **$34,000** (refundable)

### Step 4 — Net AT1 result
- Alberta tax before credits: $14,000
- Less: IEG (refundable): ($34,000)
- **Alberta net refund: $20,000**
- (The IEG creates a refundable position because credits exceed tax payable; TRA issues the refund.)

### Step 5 — Combined effective Alberta rate (this example)
- Pre-credit combined federal + AB on $400,000:
  - SBD portion: $300,000 × 11% = $33,000
  - General portion: $100,000 × 23% = $23,000
  - Combined pre-IEG: **$56,000** (14% effective)
- Post-IEG (Alberta refunds $20,000, federal SR&ED ITC computed separately):
  - Effective combined rate drops materially once both IEG and federal SR&ED ITC are factored in.

### Step 6 — Deliverables for the client
1. AT1 return + Schedules 1, 13, 21, 29
2. Federal T2 with consistent Schedule 1, 7, 23, 31, 49 entries
3. T661 federal SR&ED claim (Alberta-located expenditures flagged for IEG cross-reference)
4. IEG refund expected: ~$20,000 (subject to TRA processing — typical 6–9 months from filing)
5. Instalment recalculation for 2026 based on 2025 AT1 tax

## 12. Conservative defaults

When information is missing, the skill applies these conservative defaults (always flag for reviewer confirmation):

1. **Allocation %**: If federal Schedule 5 not yet finalized, assume **100% Alberta** only when the corporation has confirmed sole-PE Alberta status; otherwise **refuse** and request allocation.
2. **CCPC status**: Confirm CCPC status throughout the year — do **not** assume; non-CCPC status disqualifies SBD entirely.
3. **Associated group sharing**: Default the SBD allocation to **$0 for the subject corporation** until associated group T2-Sch 23 allocation is confirmed in writing.
4. **TCEC grind**: If TCEC near $10M, apply **full grind treatment** (assume worst case) until prior-year T2 Schedule 33 is reviewed.
5. **IEG prior-2-year average**: If unavailable, compute **base 8% only** (no incremental); flag for reviewer to add incremental after historic data confirmation.
6. **IEG eligibility**: Apply **only to expenditures with documented Alberta location** (work performed at AB PE, AB-resident employees); refuse to extend to ambiguous remote-work expenditures without payroll address evidence.
7. **AITC / CITC carry-forwards**: Assume **none** unless prior AT1 Schedule 10 / TRA approval letter confirms balance.
8. **Instalment base**: Default to **prior-year method** unless current-year estimate is substantially lower and documented.
9. **Filing penalty exposure**: Flag any late filing — even by 1 day — for immediate reviewer escalation.
