## Section 2 -- Reporting Framework

| Entity type | Applicable standard | CPA Handbook |
|---|---|---|
| Publicly accountable enterprises (PAE) | IFRS as issued by IASB (Canadian-adopted) | Part I |
| Private enterprises | ASPE (Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises) | Part II |
| Not-for-profit organizations | ASNPO | Part III |
| Pension plans | Part IV (specific standards) | Part IV |
| Private enterprise choosing IFRS | IFRS (permitted but not required) | Part I |

### Key difference: ASPE vs IFRS

| Area | ASPE | IFRS |
|---|---|---|
| Financial instruments | Simplified (cost/amortised cost focus) | Complex (IFRS 9 — ECL, fair value hierarchy) |
| Leases | Finance/operating distinction | IFRS 16 — right-of-use model |
| Revenue | Risks/rewards transfer model | IFRS 15 — five-step model |
| Goodwill | Amortised over useful life (max 10 years) | Not amortised; annual impairment test |
| Employee benefits | Simplified pension accounting | IAS 19 — full actuarial measurement |

---

## Section 3 -- Size Thresholds

Canada does not have statutory "size thresholds" determining accounting framework in the way EU countries do. Instead:

| Criterion | Determining factor |
|---|---|
| Public accountability | If securities are publicly traded or entity holds assets in fiduciary capacity → must use IFRS |
| Private enterprise | May choose ASPE or IFRS |
| Audit requirement | Determined by corporate statute and shareholder agreement (not size per se) |

### Audit waiver conditions (CBCA s.163)

Private corporations may waive the audit if:
- All shareholders consent annually (unanimous resolution)
- Corporation is not a distributing corporation (publicly traded)
- Revenue ≤ specified thresholds do NOT apply federally (it's purely consent-based)

### Provincial variations (examples)

| Jurisdiction | Audit waiver condition |
|---|---|
| CBCA (federal) | Unanimous shareholder consent (s.163) |
| OBCA (Ontario) | Unanimous shareholder consent (s.148) |
| BCBCA (British Columbia) | Shareholder resolution; no exemption for reporting issuers |
| ABCA (Alberta) | Unanimous shareholder consent |
| Quebec (QBCA) | Shareholder resolution; restrictions for certain entities |
