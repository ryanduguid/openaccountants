## Section 3 -- Revenue Recognition

### ASPE Section 3400 Revenue

Revenue is recognised when:
- Performance is achieved (goods delivered / services rendered)
- Collection is reasonably assured
- Amount is measurable

| Revenue Type | Recognition Point |
|---|---|
| Sale of goods | Risks and rewards transferred, amount measurable, collection probable |
| Rendering of services | Percentage of completion, or completed contract if outcome uncertain |
| Interest income | Accrued over time on effective interest basis |
| Royalties | Accrued per agreement terms |
| Dividends | When right to receive established |
| Construction contracts | Percentage of completion (ASPE 3400) |

### Cash vs Accrual for Sole Proprietors

| Method | CRA Requirement |
|---|---|
| Accrual | Default for all businesses |
| Cash (modified) | Permitted for farming, fishing, and commission-based sales agents only |
| Billed-basis | Permitted for professionals (accountants, lawyers, doctors, etc.) — WIP can be excluded from income |

Most sole proprietors must use the accrual method — income when invoiced/earned, expenses when incurred.

## Section 5 -- Asset vs Expense Thresholds

### Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) — Key Classes

| Class | Rate | Method | Typical Assets |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4% | Declining balance | Commercial buildings (post-1987) |
| 1 (M&P) | 10% | Declining balance | Manufacturing buildings |
| 8 | 20% | Declining balance | Office furniture, equipment, tools ≥ $500 |
| 10 | 30% | Declining balance | Motor vehicles (cost ≤ $38,000 + tax in 2025) |
| 10.1 | 30% | Declining balance | Passenger vehicles > $38,000 limit (separate class per vehicle) |
| 12 | 100% | Full write-off | Small tools < $500, computer software (not systems) |
| 13 | Lease term | Straight-line | Leasehold improvements |
| 14.1 | 5% | Declining balance | Goodwill and other eligible capital property |
| 43 | 30% | Declining balance | Manufacturing and processing machinery (post-2025) |
| 50 | 55% | Declining balance | Computer hardware and systems software |
| 53 | 50% | Declining balance | M&P machinery (acquired 2016–2025) |
| 54 | 30% | Declining balance | Zero-emission passenger vehicles |
| 55 | 40% | Declining balance | Zero-emission non-passenger vehicles |

### Accelerated Investment Incentive (from 2025)

For eligible property acquired after 2024 and available for use before 2030: first-year CCA = up to 3× the normal half-year amount (effectively suspending the half-year rule and tripling first-year deduction).

### Practical Thresholds

| Threshold | Treatment |
|---|---|
| < $500 | Expense immediately (supplies); or Class 12 at 100% |
| $500 – above | Capitalize: Class 8 (20%) or appropriate class |
| Current expense test | Repair vs improvement — repairs maintain; improvements extend/enhance |

### Book Amortization vs Tax CCA

Book amortization (ASPE Section 3061) uses straight-line over useful life. CCA is a separate tax schedule. They rarely match — the difference creates a deferred tax timing difference.

## Section 9 -- Micro-Entity / Small Business Simplifications

### CRA Small Business Concessions

| Concession | Eligibility | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Quick Method (GST/HST) | Taxable revenue ≤ $400,000 | Remit flat percentage of revenue; keep the difference |
| Instalment threshold | Tax owing < $3,000 (individuals) or < $3,000 (corporations) | No quarterly instalments required |
| Simplified ITC claims | Annual taxable revenue ≤ $500,000 | Can claim ITCs without full documentation for purchases under $30 |
| GIFI-Short | Revenue and assets each < $1 million | ~100 common codes instead of full GIFI list |
| T2 Short Return | Various small corporation criteria | Reduced filing requirements |
| Filing deadline | Sole prop: June 15 (return); April 30 (payment) | 2-month extension for filing but not paying |

### ASPE vs IFRS Choice

| Factor | ASPE (Private Enterprises) | IFRS (Public / Large) |
|---|---|---|
| Who | Any private company | Publicly accountable entities |
| Complexity | Simplified (no fair value for most items) | Full fair value, complex disclosures |
| Goodwill | Amortize over ≤ 40 years | Annual impairment test (no amortization) |
| Leases | Operating vs finance classification | IFRS 16: all on balance sheet |
| Financial instruments | Cost/amortized cost (default) | FVTPL or FVOCI or amortized cost |
| Cost | Lower professional fees | Higher — more disclosures |

### Compilation Engagement (NTR)

Most small Canadian businesses engage a CPA for a "compilation" (Notice to Reader) — the CPA compiles financial statements from client-provided information without performing audit or review procedures. No assurance is expressed.

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### Corporate Income Tax (T2 Return)

- Financial statements mapped via GIFI codes to T2
- Schedule 1: Net Income Reconciliation (add back: amortization, meals 50%, non-deductible items; deduct: CCA, eligible capital deductions)
- Schedule 8: CCA calculation (separate from book amortization)
- Schedule 125: Income Statement Information (GIFI)
- Schedule 100: Balance Sheet Information (GIFI)
- Active business income ≤ $500,000: small business deduction (combined federal/provincial ~12.2% varies by province)
- Investment income: taxed at ~50%, refundable upon dividend distribution (RDTOH)

### GST/HST Return

| Line | Description | CoA Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| 101 | GST/HST collected (or collectible) | 2050 |
| 105 | Total GST/HST and adjustments | 2050 + adjustments |
| 106 | Input Tax Credits (ITCs) | 1150 |
| 108 | Total ITCs and adjustments | 1150 + adjustments |
| 109 | Net tax (remit or refund) | 2060 |

### Payroll Remittances

| Item | Rate (2025) | Employer Portion |
|---|---|---|
| CPP (employee) | 5.95% on pensionable earnings $3,500–$71,300 | Employer matches 1:1 |
| CPP2 (second ceiling) | 4.0% on $71,300–$81,200 | Employer matches 1:1 |
| EI (employee) | 1.64% on insurable earnings up to $65,700 | Employer pays 1.4× employee amount |
| Federal income tax | Per tax tables (withholding) | Employer remits to CRA |

### Provincial Considerations

- Quebec: separate QST (9.975%) and QPP (instead of CPP); file with Revenu Québec
- PST provinces (BC, SK, MB): PST is not an input tax credit — it becomes part of the asset/expense cost
- HST provinces (ON, NB, NS, NL, PE): combined rate; single return to CRA
- Alberta: GST only (5%), no provincial sales tax
