## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-CA-F1 -- Director residency non-compliance (federal).** "Under the CBCA, at least 25% of directors must be resident Canadians. If fewer than 4 directors, at least 1 must be Canadian-resident. Failure to comply can result in dissolution proceedings. If no Canadian resident is available, consider incorporating in BC or Nova Scotia (no residency requirement)."

**R-CA-F2 -- Missing extra-provincial registration.** "A federal corporation must register in each province where it carries on business. Operating without registration can result in the corporation being unable to maintain legal proceedings in that province."

**R-CA-F3 -- GST/HST threshold ignorance.** "GST/HST registration is mandatory once worldwide taxable supplies exceed $30,000 in any four consecutive calendar quarters. Failure to register triggers penalties and interest."

**R-CA-F4 -- Confusing incorporation with business registration.** "Sole proprietors and partnerships register a business name; they do not incorporate. Incorporation creates a separate legal entity with limited liability. These are fundamentally different."

**R-CA-F5 -- Shell company for non-resident tax avoidance.** "A Canadian corporation is taxed on worldwide income. Using a Canadian corporation solely to hold passive investments or as a conduit without Canadian substance may attract CRA scrutiny and GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule) application."
