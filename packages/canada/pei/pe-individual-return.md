Same as federal taxable income (Line 26000).

### Step 2: Apply PEI Bracket Rates
- First $32,656 × 9.65%
- $32,657 to $64,313 × 13.63%
- $64,314 to $105,000 × 16.65%
- Above $105,000 × 18%

### Step 3: Subtract Non-Refundable Tax Credits
Total credit amounts × 9.65% (lowest bracket rate).

### Step 4: Calculate Surtax
If basic provincial tax > $12,500: add 10% of excess.

### Step 5: Apply Low-Income Tax Reduction
Reduces or eliminates tax for low-income earners.

### Step 6: Net Provincial Tax
After surtax addition and credit reductions.

### Step 7: Apply Refundable Credits

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 PEI Surtax Impact
The surtax is unique to PEI among Atlantic provinces. It effectively creates a higher marginal rate for high-income earners:

| Basic Provincial Tax | Effective Surtax | Total Effective Top Rate |
|---|---|---|
| $12,500 or less | None | 18% (top bracket only) |
| $15,000 | ($15,000 - $12,500) × 10% = $250 | ~18.2% effective |
| $20,000 | ($20,000 - $12,500) × 10% = $750 | ~18.5% effective |
| $30,000+ | Significant | ~19.8% effective on top bracket |

### 6.2 Seasonal Workers
PEI has significant seasonal employment (fishing, tourism, agriculture). Workers may have:
- EI benefits during off-season (taxable)
- Intermittent T4s from multiple employers
- Provincial tax applies to total income regardless of seasonal pattern

### 6.3 Small Province Considerations
PEI has a small population (~170,000) -- fewer provincial-specific programs compared to larger provinces. Federal credits (GST/HST credit, Canada Workers Benefit) are particularly important for low-income PEI residents.

### 6.4 Inter-Provincial Commuters
Workers commuting to Nova Scotia or New Brunswick for employment are taxed as PEI residents if resident on Dec 31 in PEI. No provincial tax allocation for employment income earned in other provinces.

### 6.5 Community Development Equity Tax Credit

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Credit rate | 35% of eligible investment |
| Maximum investment | $20,000/year |
| Maximum credit | $7,000/year |
| Eligible businesses | PEI-based community development corporations |
| Hold period | 5 years minimum |
| Carry-forward | 4 years |

### 6.6 PEI Property Transfer Tax
When acquiring property in PEI, a Real Property Transfer Tax of 1% of the greater of purchase price or assessed value applies. This is not an income tax but relevant context for property investors -- it adds to cost base for CGT purposes.

---

## Section 6 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply other provincial rates to a PEI resident
- NEVER separate HST into components for filing -- PEI uses harmonized HST
- NEVER ignore the surtax calculation for higher-income earners
- NEVER claim PEI credits without confirming PEI residency on December 31
- NEVER omit the surtax from the computation -- it applies in addition to bracket rates
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
