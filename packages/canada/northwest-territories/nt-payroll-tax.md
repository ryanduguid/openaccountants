# Northwest Territories — Payroll Tax — Skill v1.0

## 1. Quick reference

The Northwest Territories Payroll Tax is a **2% tax on remuneration** paid to employees who report for work at a permanent establishment of the employer in the Northwest Territories, OR who are deemed to be employed in the NWT under the *Payroll Tax Act* (NWT).

Key characteristics — unique among Canadian jurisdictions:

| Feature | Value |
|---|---|
| Rate | 2.0% of gross remuneration |
| Who pays | Employer (statutory liability) — but employer is required to withhold from the employee's pay |
| Refundability for residents | NWT residents reclaim it via the **Cost of Living Tax Credit** on their T1 (Form NT479) |
| Net effect for low-income NWT residents | Approximately zero (fully offset by the credit) |
| Net effect for non-residents working in NWT (fly-in workers) | 2% out-of-pocket — no credit available |
| Filing frequency | Monthly remittances + annual reconciliation (Form NWT401) |
| Administered by | NWT Department of Finance — *not* CRA |

> **Why it exists.** The NWT has a small resident workforce and a large transient/fly-in workforce (mining, oil & gas, construction). The payroll tax is structured so that the *cost* falls on non-resident workers (who use NWT infrastructure but pay no NWT income tax) while *residents* are made whole through the refundable Cost of Living Tax Credit.

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

1. **Employer details** — legal name, business number, NWT payroll tax account number (assigned on registration with NWT Finance).
2. **Permanent establishment status** — does the employer have a PE in NWT? (Office, mine, camp, construction site lasting > 30 days, etc.)
3. **Per-employee data for the period:**
   - Employee name and SIN
   - NWT resident vs non-resident status (for the employee's own T1 — does not change employer remittance)
   - Gross remuneration paid in the period (salary, wages, bonuses, taxable benefits, vacation pay, commissions, directors' fees, gratuities reported to employer, stock option benefits)
   - Days worked in NWT vs days worked elsewhere (for allocation if employee splits time)
4. **Period** — calendar month for remittance; calendar year for NWT401 reconciliation.
5. **Prior remittances** — running total of monthly remittances for the year-to-date.

### Refusal catalogue — out of scope for this skill

- **R-NT-PAY-1.** Self-employed individuals / sole proprietors with no employees — payroll tax does **not** apply to drawings or self-employment income. Refuse and redirect to T1 / T2125.
- **R-NT-PAY-2.** Allocation disputes between NWT and another jurisdiction for an employee splitting time across multiple provinces/territories with complex facts. Escalate to NWT Finance ruling.
- **R-NT-PAY-3.** Treaty-protected non-resident-of-Canada employees (e.g., short-term US-based employees relying on Article XV of the Canada-US Treaty) — federal treaty protection does **not** override NWT payroll tax, but the analysis is non-trivial. Escalate.
- **R-NT-PAY-4.** Status Indian employees working on a reserve — reserves are uncommon in NWT but the s. 87 *Indian Act* analysis interacts with the *Payroll Tax Act*. Escalate.
- **R-NT-PAY-5.** Stock option benefits where the option was granted while the employee was in another jurisdiction and exercised while in NWT — sourcing rules are complex. Escalate.
- **R-NT-PAY-6.** Successor employer / asset-purchase scenarios where account transfer is contemplated. Escalate.

---

## 3. Rate and incidence

- **Rate:** 2.0% on all wages, salaries, and other remuneration paid to employees who report for work in the Northwest Territories.
- **Employer-paid only** — there is no separate employee contribution. However, the *Payroll Tax Act* requires the employer to **withhold** the 2% from the employee's pay, so the economic incidence is on the employee even though the statutory liability is on the employer.
- The employer remits the withheld amount to the **NWT Department of Finance** — this is entirely separate from CRA payroll remittances (CPP/EI/income tax withholding) and is **not** part of the PD7A workflow.

### Base of the tax — what counts as "remuneration"

Includes:
- Salary, wages, hourly pay
- Overtime, shift premiums, on-call pay
- Bonuses, commissions, incentive pay
- Vacation pay (paid out or accrued)
- Directors' fees
- Stock option benefits taxable under ITA s. 7
- Taxable allowances and benefits (housing, automobile, etc.)
- Tips and gratuities controlled by the employer
- Severance and retiring allowances
- Pay in lieu of notice

Excludes:
- Reimbursements of business expenses
- Non-taxable benefits (e.g., reasonable per-diem travel allowances)
- Pension benefits paid to former employees (paid by pension administrators, not by the employer in respect of employment)
- Workers' compensation benefits

## 4. Coordination with the Cost of Living Tax Credit (NWT residents)

NWT residents reclaim the 2% via the **Cost of Living Tax Credit** on their T1, computed on **Form NT479 — Northwest Territories Credits**.

### How it works

1. Employer withholds 2% and remits it to NWT Finance throughout the year.
2. At year-end, employer reports total NWT payroll tax withheld in **Box 14** of the T4 *informational note* (the T4 itself does not have a dedicated box — the amount is typically disclosed on the T4 "Other information" area using code 80 / employer note; verify current CRA T4 guide).
3. NWT-resident employee files T1 + NT(S2) provincial schedule + **NT479**.
4. NT479 computes the Cost of Living Tax Credit, which is a **refundable** credit. For low-to-middle income NWT residents the credit is calibrated to approximately offset the 2% payroll tax. The credit phases down at higher income levels — so high-income NWT residents bear a partial 2% cost, and very high-income earners bear nearly the full 2%.
5. Non-residents of NWT (e.g., Alberta fly-in workers, Ontario consultants) cannot claim NT479 — they bear the full 2% with no offset.

> **Practical implication.** When advising NWT-resident employees, emphasise that the 2% withheld from each paycheque is largely recovered at tax time via NT479 — they should not view it as a permanent cost. When advising employers with fly-in workforces, flag that fly-in workers' net pay is permanently reduced by 2% (no recovery), which may affect compensation negotiations.

## 5. Registration

### Who must register

**Any employer** that:
- (a) has a permanent establishment in the Northwest Territories, OR
- (b) pays remuneration to an employee who reports for work at a PE in NWT, OR
- (c) pays remuneration to an employee who works in NWT for any period (the "deemed PE" rule for transient employers)

— regardless of where the employer itself is incorporated or resident.

> **This means** a Calgary or Toronto company with even one NWT-resident remote worker has an NWT payroll tax registration and remittance obligation. The "we have no NWT office, we just have a remote employee in Yellowknife" defence does **not** work.

### How to register

- File the **Application for Registration as an Employer** with the NWT Department of Finance, Taxation Division.
- An NWT Payroll Tax account number is issued.
- Registration deadline: before the first remittance is due (i.e., before the 20th of the month following the first month wages are paid).

### Deregistration

- File a closure form with NWT Finance when the last NWT employee leaves payroll.
- File the final NWT401 reconciliation.

---

## 6. Filing — monthly remittances + annual reconciliation

### Monthly remittances

- Due on or before the **20th day of the month following** the month in which the remuneration was paid.
- Example: remuneration paid in October 2025 → remit by 20 November 2025.
- Remittance form: monthly payroll tax remittance return (PDF or NWT Finance e-portal).
- Late filing / late payment penalty: typically the greater of 10% of the amount owing or a fixed dollar minimum, plus interest at the prescribed NWT rate (verify current rate in NWT Finance bulletins).

### Quarterly remittance option

- Small employers (total annual remuneration below a low threshold set by NWT Finance — verify current threshold) may apply to remit quarterly. Approval is discretionary.

### Annual reconciliation — Form NWT401

- Due **on or before 28 February** of the year following the calendar year.
- Reconciles the sum of monthly remittances to the actual 2% × total remuneration for the year.
- Any shortfall is paid with the NWT401; any overpayment is refunded or credited forward on application.
- Also reports the per-employee remuneration figures used to compute the credit (so NWT Finance can cross-check NT479 claims).

## 7. Form NWT401 — annual reconciliation

The NWT401 is the **employer's** annual reconciliation. Key sections:

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Part 1 | Employer identification (legal name, NWT payroll tax account number, business number, address) |
| Part 2 | Total remuneration paid in the year to all employees subject to NWT payroll tax |
| Part 3 | 2% × total remuneration = payroll tax payable for the year |
| Part 4 | Sum of monthly remittances paid during the year |
| Part 5 | Balance owing (Part 3 minus Part 4, if positive) or refund / carryforward (if negative) |
| Part 6 | Per-employee schedule — name, SIN, gross remuneration, NWT payroll tax withheld |
| Part 7 | Certification by employer |

Filing channel: paper or NWT Finance e-portal. Retain supporting payroll records for **6 years**.

## 8. Worked example — Yellowknife mining services company

**Facts.**
- "Arctic Drill Services Ltd." — a CCPC with a PE (drilling yard + offices) in Yellowknife.
- 50 employees on the NWT payroll for calendar year 2025:
  - 35 NWT residents (Yellowknife and Hay River-based) earning $3.5M total
  - 15 fly-in workers from Alberta and Saskatchewan earning $1.5M total
- Total NWT remuneration for 2025: **$5,000,000**.

**Computation.**

1. NWT Payroll Tax = 2% × $5,000,000 = **$100,000**.
2. Monthly remittances throughout 2025 (illustrative, even payroll):
   - $100,000 ÷ 12 ≈ $8,333.33 per month
   - Due on or before 20th of the following month
3. Annual reconciliation NWT401 filed 28 February 2026 — confirms $100,000 paid, no balance owing.
4. **T4 reporting.** Each employee's T4 shows gross employment income (no reduction for the 2% — the withholding is a tax, not an employment deduction). The 2% withheld is reported in the T4 "Other information" area with the appropriate code (verify code in current CRA T4 guide; commonly code 80 / employer note).
5. **NT479 credit on individual returns.**
   - The 35 NWT residents file T1 + NT(S2) + **NT479** and claim the Cost of Living Tax Credit. For most of them — low- to middle-income earners — the credit effectively returns the 2% to them.
   - Example: an NWT resident earning $80,000 has $1,600 withheld in NWT payroll tax during the year. On NT479, after applying the credit formula, the credit is roughly $1,500–$1,600 — substantially offsetting the cost. (Exact numbers depend on the year's NT479 formula — see Sources.)
   - The 15 Alberta/Saskatchewan fly-in workers file their T1 in their province of residence, **cannot** claim NT479, and bear the full 2% (≈ $30,000 in aggregate across the 15 workers) as a permanent cost.

**Net cost to employer.** Zero direct cost (employer withholds from employee pay, then remits to NWT Finance). Indirect cost: administrative compliance burden plus possible compensation pressure from fly-in workers asking for a "NWT premium" to offset their 2% drag.

## 9. Coordination with federal payroll deductions

The NWT Payroll Tax is **completely separate** from CRA payroll remittances. Specifically:

| Item | CRA (federal) | NWT Finance |
|---|---|---|
| CPP contributions (employee + employer) | Yes — PD7A | No |
| EI premiums (employee + employer) | Yes — PD7A | No |
| Income tax withholding (federal + provincial/territorial) | Yes — PD7A | No |
| NWT Payroll Tax | No | Yes — monthly remittance + NWT401 |
| Forms | T4 slip, T4 Summary, PD7A | NWT401 + monthly remittance |
| Account | CRA payroll account (RP) | NWT payroll tax account |
| Deadline for monthly remittance | Varies (regular: 15th of following month; threshold-based) | 20th of following month |
| Year-end deadline | T4 / T4 Summary by last day of February | NWT401 by 28 February |

### T4 reporting

- T4 Box 14 — **Employment income** — reports **gross** remuneration. The 2% NWT payroll tax is **not** subtracted from Box 14 — it is a tax withheld, not an employment expense.
- T4 Box 22 — Income tax deducted — reports federal + territorial income tax withheld. **Do not** include the 2% NWT payroll tax here.
- T4 "Other information" — the 2% NWT payroll tax withheld is reported separately so that the NWT-resident employee can claim NT479. Use the code specified in the current CRA T4 guide (commonly the employer note / Other Info code 80; verify annually).

### Deduction for the employer

- Because the statutory incidence is the **employer** but the tax is withheld from employee pay, the employer's net cash outlay is zero. There is no employer deduction for the 2% withheld and remitted (the employer is acting as a withholding agent, not bearing the cost).
- If, by contract, an employer agrees to **gross up** the employee's pay to absorb the 2% (some employers do this to attract talent), the gross-up itself is additional remuneration — which is itself subject to 2% NWT payroll tax (circular, but small).

## 10. Conservative defaults

When facts are ambiguous, apply the following defaults:

1. **Default to "remuneration is taxable"** — if uncertain whether a payment is "remuneration", include it in the 2% base. The employee will recover it via NT479 if they are an NWT resident.
2. **Default to "employee is reporting for work in NWT"** — if the employee has any NWT connection (NWT address on file, days worked in NWT, NWT-based supervisor), apply the 2%. Excluding by mistake creates an employer liability with penalties; including by mistake is recovered by the employee at year-end.
3. **Default to registering** — if the employer has even one possibly-NWT employee, register. The cost of an unused account is near zero; the cost of unregistered remittance liability is significant.
4. **Default to monthly remittance** — quarterly is by application only; assume monthly unless NWT Finance has approved otherwise in writing.
5. **Default to reconciling annually even if no remittance was due** — if registered, file the NWT401 with zeros rather than skip filing.
6. **Default to escalating non-resident-of-Canada employees** — treaty interactions are out of scope for this skill (R-NT-PAY-3).
7. **Default to verifying the current NT479 formula and Cost of Living Tax Credit parameters annually** — the credit amounts and phase-out are updated by NWT Finance each year.
