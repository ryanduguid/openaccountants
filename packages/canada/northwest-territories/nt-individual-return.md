## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- territory of residence on Dec 31 (must be NWT), federal taxable income (T1 line 26000), federal net income.

**Recommended** -- marital status, spouse income, children, status Indian indicator, Inuvialuit beneficiary status, T1 line 23600 (net income, for Cost of Living credit calc).

**Ideal** -- complete T1 data, prior NT428, GNWT credit assessments.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-NT-2 -- Corporations/trusts.** "Individual sole proprietors only."

**R-NT-3 -- Part-year resident.** "Escalate. Apply NT rates only to the period of NWT residency."

**R-NT-4 -- Income earned on reserve under s. 87 Indian Act.** "Escalate. Federal exemption may also extend to territorial tax."

---

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Low Income

**Input:** Taxable income $20,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- Gross NWT tax: $20,000 × 5.90% = $1,180.00
- BPA credit: $17,373 × 5.90% = $1,025.01
- Basic NWT tax before Cost of Living credit: $154.99
- Cost of Living credit (basic): $12,000 × 15.65% = $1,878.00
- Net NWT tax (refundable portion): −$1,723.01 (i.e., $1,723.01 refundable to taxpayer)

### Example 2 -- Mid-Range

**Input:** Taxable income $80,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $51,964 at 5.90% = $3,065.88
- $28,036 at 8.60% = $2,411.10
- Gross NWT tax: $5,476.98
- BPA credit: $1,025.01
- Basic NWT tax: $4,451.97
- Cost of Living basic credit ($12,000 × 15.65%) = $1,878.00 plus partial supplementary
- Net NWT tax: ~$2,573.97 (approximate; verify supplementary formula)

### Example 3 -- High Income

**Input:** Taxable income $250,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $51,964 at 5.90% = $3,065.88
- $51,966 at 8.60% = $4,469.08
- $65,037 at 12.20% = $7,934.51
- $81,033 at 14.05% = $11,385.14
- Gross NWT tax: $26,854.61
- BPA credit: $1,025.01
- Basic NWT tax: $25,829.60
- Cost of Living credit fully phased out at this income.

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### EC-NT-1: Cost of Living Tax Credit supplementary formula

The supplementary credit on income $12,000–$66,000 uses a decreasing rate. Verify the exact formula from the current GNWT NT479 schedule before computing. Conservative default: report basic credit only and flag supplementary as [T2].

### EC-NT-2: Carbon tax rebate

The NWT has a territorial carbon tax with its own rebate mechanism administered by GNWT (not the federal Canada Carbon Rebate). Confirm the year's rebate amount from the GNWT Department of Finance.

### EC-NT-3: Resource royalties

If the taxpayer's T2125 includes NWT diamond, gold or oil/gas royalty income, escalate — territorial royalty interactions are complex and may interact with the Mackenzie Valley resource agreements.

### EC-NT-4: Inuvialuit Final Agreement beneficiaries

Income earned within the Inuvialuit Settlement Region may have specific tax treatment under the Inuvialuit Final Agreement. Escalate.
