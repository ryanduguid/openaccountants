# Quebec — Employer Contributions (CNESST / HSF / QPIP / QPP) — Skill v1.0

> **Scope note.** This skill covers Quebec-specific payroll contributions remitted to **Revenu Québec** and to **CNESST**. It is a Quebec overlay on top of the federal payroll skill at `canada-payroll.md`. Do NOT duplicate federal mechanics here — for federal source deductions (federal income tax, EI, the federal half of remitting cadence, ROE/T4 mechanics, RP account setup, RC1 enrolment, etc.) **read `canada-payroll.md` first**, then layer the Quebec rules below.
>
> Quebec is the only province where the employer files a **separate provincial payroll return** (the source-deductions remittance **TPZ-1015.R-V**) and where **QPP replaces CPP** entirely. Quebec also has its own **RL-1** slip parallel to the federal T4 (covered in the Quebec individual-return skill, not here).

## 1. Quick reference table — 2025 Quebec employer contributions

| # | Contribution | Who pays | Administered by | 2025 employee rate | 2025 employer rate | 2025 earnings ceiling / base |
|---|--------------|----------|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | **QPP** base | EE + ER | Revenu Québec / Retraite Québec | 5.40% | 5.40% | $3,500 exemption – **$71,300** YMPE |
| 1a | **QPP** additional (first additional contribution) | EE + ER | Revenu Québec / Retraite Québec | 1.00% | 1.00% | $3,500 – $71,300 |
| 1b | **QPP2** (second additional, on YAMPE band) | EE + ER | Revenu Québec / Retraite Québec | 4.00% | 4.00% | $71,300 – **$81,200** (YAMPE) |
| 2 | **QPIP / RQAP** | EE + ER (+ self-employed) | Conseil de gestion de l'assurance parentale / Revenu Québec | **0.494%** | **0.692%** (SE: 0.878%) | Max insurable earnings **$98,000** |
| 3 | **HSF / FSS** | ER only | Revenu Québec | — | **1.65% → 4.26%** sliding by total payroll | Total Quebec payroll (no ceiling) |
| 4 | **CNESST** (occupational health & safety / workers' comp) | ER only | CNESST (separate ministry) | — | Sector-rated, typically **0.5%–5%+** | Insurable earnings up to **$98,000/worker** (same 2025 max as QPIP) |
| 5 | **WSDRF** (1% training levy, Loi du 1%) | ER only | Revenu Québec (Commission des partenaires du marché du travail) | — | **1.0%** of payroll | Only if total payroll **> $2,000,000** |

**Maximum annual QPP employee contribution (2025):**
- Base + additional = $4,348.50 (5.4% × ($71,300 − $3,500) + 1.0% × ($71,300 − $3,500) = $3,661.20 + $678.00; per Retraite Québec rounding the published maximum is **$4,348.50**).
- QPP2 maximum = 4.0% × ($81,200 − $71,300) = **$396.00**.
- **Total maximum employee QPP (2025) = $4,744.50.** Employer matches dollar-for-dollar.

> The "base + additional" presentation is how Retraite Québec publishes the 2025 figures: a combined first-tier rate of **6.4% EE / 6.4% ER** on earnings between $3,500 and $71,300, and a second-tier **4% EE / 4% ER** on earnings between $71,300 and $81,200. Some Revenu Québec guides express the first-tier rate as a single 6.4% figure rather than 5.4% + 1.0% — both are equivalent.

---

## 2. Required inputs + refusal catalogue

### 2.1 Required inputs (gather before computing)

- **Total annual Quebec payroll** (gross wages, salaries, bonuses, taxable benefits subject to source deductions) — drives HSF rate and WSDRF threshold.
- **Per-employee gross pensionable / insurable earnings**, broken down by:
  - Earnings up to $71,300 (for QPP base + additional)
  - Earnings between $71,300 and $81,200 (for QPP2)
  - Earnings up to $98,000 (for QPIP and CNESST insurable earnings)
- **CNESST sector classification(s)** — NAICS-based unit code(s) assigned by CNESST in the *Avis de cotisation* / employer file. A single employer may have multiple classification units.
- **Whether the employer is in the public/parapublic sector** (different HSF table applies — out of scope, see §2.2).
- **Whether any workers are self-employed contractors paid through payroll** (QPIP self-employed rate of 0.878% differs; CPP/QPP and CNESST may not apply — confirm worker status under the Revenu Québec employee-vs-contractor tests).
- **Employer's NEQ (numéro d'entreprise du Québec)** and Revenu Québec identification number (NIQ).
- **Remittance frequency** as assigned by Revenu Québec (weekly / twice-monthly / monthly / quarterly — mirrors federal threshold logic but is determined by Revenu Québec separately based on the **average monthly Quebec source deductions**).

### 2.2 Refusal catalogue — when to stop and escalate

Refuse to compute and escalate to a Quebec-licensed CPA / payroll specialist if any of the following apply:

- **R-QC-1.** Employer is in the **public sector or parapublic sector** (different HSF rate table; reduced rate not available).
- **R-QC-2.** Employer is requesting **HSF reduced rate for the primary-and-manufacturing sector** (special table — verify eligibility under the SMB sector rules; do not assume).
- **R-QC-3.** Worker classification is ambiguous (employee vs. self-employed contractor) — defer to a Quebec employment-law review; misclassification triggers CNESST, QPP, QPIP, and HSF retroactive assessments plus penalties.
- **R-QC-4.** Employer has workers in **multiple CNESST classification units** and is requesting an allocation across units — refer to a CNESST tarification consultant.
- **R-QC-5.** Employer is requesting **WSDRF training-expenditure substantiation** (which courses qualify under the *Loi favorisant le développement et la reconnaissance des compétences de la main-d'œuvre*) — refer to the Commission des partenaires du marché du travail (CPMT).
- **R-QC-6.** Employer has **out-of-province employees physically reporting to a Quebec establishment**, or vice versa — the "establishment to which the employee reports" rule under R.R.Q. requires case-by-case analysis.
- **R-QC-7.** Indigenous employers operating on reserve, or employees with Indian Act §87 exemptions — out of scope.
- **R-QC-8.** **First-Nations or Inuit employer** subject to special HSF / QPIP exemptions under intergovernmental agreements.
- **R-QC-9.** Employer is a **non-resident of Canada with a Quebec establishment** — non-resident employer certification regime + Quebec source-deduction rules interact; refer.
- **R-QC-10.** Mid-year **change in legal status, amalgamation, or asset sale** affecting payroll continuity (e.g., successor employer rules for QPP/QPIP ceilings).

---

## 3. QPP — Quebec Pension Plan (replaces CPP)

### 3.1 Why QPP instead of CPP

CPP does **not** apply to employees whose **establishment of the employer is in Quebec**. QPP applies instead, administered jointly by **Retraite Québec** (benefits, plan administration) and **Revenu Québec** (collection of contributions through source deductions).

If the same individual has Quebec and non-Quebec employment income in the same year, QPP and CPP are reconciled on the federal **T1 / Schedule 8** and Quebec **TP-1 / Schedule R**. Out of scope for this payroll skill — see `qc-individual-return.md`.

### 3.2 2025 rates and ceilings

- **YMPE** (maximum pensionable earnings) = **$71,300**
- **YAMPE** (additional maximum pensionable earnings) = **$81,200**
- **Basic exemption** = **$3,500** (only the base + first-additional tier benefit from the exemption; QPP2 has no exemption — it applies to the entire YMPE-to-YAMPE band)
- **Base rate** = 5.40% EE + 5.40% ER (10.80% total)
- **First additional rate** = 1.00% EE + 1.00% ER (2.00% total)
  → Combined first-tier = **6.40% EE + 6.40% ER** on earnings $3,500 – $71,300
- **Second additional (QPP2)** = 4.00% EE + 4.00% ER on earnings $71,300 – $81,200

### 3.3 Computation per pay period

For each pay period (Revenu Québec method, also expressible via the WebRAS calculator):

1. Compute **annualized pensionable earnings** for the period.
2. Apply pro-rated **basic exemption** ($3,500 ÷ number of pay periods).
3. Compute first-tier QPP at **6.40%** on the result (employee and employer each).
4. If annualized earnings exceed $71,300, compute QPP2 at **4.00%** on the excess up to $81,200 (employee and employer each).
5. Cap year-to-date employee contribution at **$4,744.50** ($4,348.50 base+additional + $396.00 QPP2).

### 3.4 Reporting

- Source-deductions remittance: **TPZ-1015.R-V** (combined with QPIP, HSF, and Quebec income tax).
- Year-end slip: **RL-1**, Box B (QPP) and Box B.A (QPP2 — second additional contribution).
- Reconciliation: **Sommaire 1** (RLZ-1.S-V) — annual summary of source deductions and employer contributions, due **last day of February**.

### 3.5 Self-employed Quebec residents

Self-employed individuals pay **both halves** of QPP (12.80% on the first tier, 8.00% on QPP2) through their Quebec personal return (TP-1, Schedule U / form TP-1129.66.3.6-V), not through payroll. Not covered further in this skill.

---

## 4. QPIP / RQAP — Quebec Parental Insurance Plan

### 4.1 Why QPIP exists

Since **2006**, Quebec has run its own parental-insurance regime under the *Loi sur l'assurance parentale* (Régime québécois d'assurance parentale, RQAP). It replaces the **parental-benefits portion** of federal EI for Quebec workers. Federal EI premiums are correspondingly **reduced** for Quebec employees (the EI Quebec-reduced rate is published annually by the CEIC).

### 4.2 2025 rates

| Payer | Rate | Applied to |
|-------|------|-----------|
| Employee | **0.494%** | Insurable earnings up to $98,000 |
| Employer | **0.692%** | Insurable earnings up to $98,000 |
| Self-employed | **0.878%** | Net self-employment earnings up to $98,000 |

- **Maximum insurable earnings (MIE) 2025 = $98,000.**
- **Maximum 2025 employee QPIP = $484.12** (0.494% × $98,000).
- **Maximum 2025 employer QPIP per employee = $678.16** (0.692% × $98,000).
- No earnings exemption — premiums apply from the **first dollar** of insurable earnings.

### 4.3 Federal EI coordination

The employer still withholds **federal EI** from Quebec employees but at the **Quebec-reduced rate** (set annually by the CEIC — historically about **15% lower** than the rest-of-Canada rate). The EI premium reduction reflects QPIP picking up parental benefits. See `canada-payroll.md` §EI for the federal mechanics — do not duplicate.

### 4.4 Reporting

- Withheld and remitted on **TPZ-1015.R-V** alongside QPP and Quebec income tax.
- Year-end slip: **RL-1**, Box H (QPIP premium) and Box I (QPIP insurable earnings).

---

## 5. HSF / FSS — Fonds des services de santé (Health Services Fund)

### 5.1 Purpose

The HSF is an **employer-only** contribution that funds Quebec's public health-care system. There is no employee portion and no ceiling per employee — it applies to the entire Quebec payroll without any per-employee cap.

### 5.2 2025 rate schedule (private-sector SMBs, all sectors)

The 2025 HSF rate slides based on **total annual Quebec payroll (TP)**:

| Total Quebec payroll (TP) | HSF rate |
|----------------------------|----------|
| TP ≤ $1,000,000 | **1.65%** |
| $1,000,000 < TP ≤ $7,500,000 | Computed by formula (see §5.3) |
| TP > $7,500,000 | **4.26%** |

> **Reduced rate** is available to private-sector employers in the **primary and manufacturing sectors** with TP ≤ $7.5M (lower entry rate, sliding scale). Out of scope here — see refusal **R-QC-2**.

### 5.3 Sliding-scale formula ($1M < TP ≤ $7.5M)

Revenu Québec publishes the formula in *Guide TP-1015.G-V* and the *Guide de l'employeur* (TP-1015.G):

> HSF rate (private sector, general) = **0.7575% + (0.9075% × TP / $1,000,000)** for $1M < TP ≤ $7.5M, expressed as a percentage and rounded as Revenu Québec specifies.

For a payroll of **$3,000,000**:
- Rate = 0.7575% + (0.9075% × 3) = 0.7575% + 2.7225% = **3.48%** (rounded per Revenu Québec).

> Always compute using the **current-year Revenu Québec rate calculator** (Outil de calcul du taux du FSS) rather than from memory — the formula coefficients are updated periodically by budget legislation.

### 5.4 Reporting

- Remitted with each source-deductions remittance (TPZ-1015.R-V) using the **expected annual rate** derived from estimated payroll, then **trued up on the Sommaire 1 (RLZ-1.S-V)** based on actual year-end payroll.
- If estimated rate < actual rate, employer owes the difference (no penalty if reasonable estimate); if estimated rate > actual, refund or carry-forward credit on the Sommaire 1.

## 6. CNESST (formerly CSST) — Workplace Safety & Health Insurance

### 6.1 What CNESST is and isn't

**CNESST** (Commission des normes, de l'équité, de la santé et de la sécurité du travail) is a **separate ministry** from Revenu Québec — created in 2016 from the merger of the CSST (workers' comp), CNT (labour standards), and CES (pay equity). For payroll-contribution purposes, "CNESST" generally refers to the **workers' compensation premium** (formerly CSST), governed by the *Loi sur les accidents du travail et les maladies professionnelles* (LATMP) and *Loi sur la santé et la sécurité du travail* (LSST).

CNESST contribution is **employer-only**. It is **not** filed on TPZ-1015 — it has its **own annual statement** and remittance flow.

### 6.2 2025 rate structure

- **Rate varies by sector and classification unit** — assigned by CNESST in the *Décision sur la classification* and published annually. Typical ranges:
  - Office / professional services: **~0.15%–0.50%**
  - Retail, hospitality: **~0.50%–1.50%**
  - Construction (subject to ASP Construction): **3%–6%+**
  - Forestry, mining, heavy industry: **5%+**
- **Insurable earnings ceiling per worker (2025): $98,000** (same as QPIP MIE — Quebec aligns these annually).
- Larger employers (>$586,500 estimated 2025 premium threshold, indexed) may be in the **retrospective** or **personalized** rate regime rather than the **rate-applied-to-payroll** regime — refer to CNESST tarification specialist (refusal **R-QC-4**).

### 6.3 Annual filing — Déclaration des salaires (DAS)

- **Form: Déclaration des salaires** (annual statement of insurable wages), filed online via **Mon Espace CNESST**.
- **Due: 14 March** of the following year (i.e., the 2025 statement is due 14 March 2026).
- Reconciles **estimated premiums paid through periodic remittance** against **actual insurable wages**.
- **Periodic remittance** is integrated with Revenu Québec source-deductions remittance via the **Versement périodique** mechanism: employer pays estimated CNESST premium to **Revenu Québec** on the same TPZ-1015.R-V schedule, and Revenu Québec forwards to CNESST. The annual reconciliation happens on the Déclaration des salaires.

> The **28 February** date sometimes cited applies to the federal **T4 / RL-1** slips and Sommaire 1, not to the CNESST DAS. The CNESST DAS is due **14 March**.

### 6.4 Other CNESST employer obligations not covered here

- Pay equity (Loi sur l'équité salariale) — separate triennial maintenance obligation.
- Labour standards levy (formerly CNT levy) — replaced by CNESST general financing; usually embedded in remittance.
- Health-and-safety prevention programs (groupes prioritaires, programmes de prévention) — sector-dependent.

---

## 7. WSDRF — Workforce Skills Development and Recognition Fund ("1% Training Levy")

### 7.1 Legal basis

*Loi favorisant le développement et la reconnaissance des compétences de la main-d'œuvre*, R.S.Q. c. D-8.3 (the "Loi du 1%"). Administered by the **Commission des partenaires du marché du travail (CPMT)** with collection via Revenu Québec.

### 7.2 Who is subject

Employers whose **total Quebec payroll exceeds $2,000,000** in the calendar year.

### 7.3 The 1% obligation — spend or pay

Eligible employers must **spend at least 1% of total payroll on eligible training expenditures** during the year. If they spend less than 1%, the **shortfall** is remitted to Revenu Québec as a contribution to the WSDRF.

- **Eligible expenditures** are defined in the CPMT regulations (training provided by recognized educators, certain in-house training, training-related travel, etc.). See refusal **R-QC-5** for substantiation work.
- **Reporting:** declared on form **LE-39.0.2-V** (*Calcul des cotisations de l'employeur — fonds des services de santé et formation*) and reconciled on the **Sommaire 1**.
- **Carry-forward:** unused excess training expenditures (i.e., spent >1%) can be **carried forward** to reduce the obligation in future years, subject to CPMT rules.

### 7.4 Quick test

Total Quebec payroll for 2025 = **$2,000,001** → subject. Total Quebec payroll = **$1,999,999** → not subject. (The threshold is the calendar year, evaluated on actual payroll, not estimated.)

---

## 8. Federal coordination

Cross-reference `canada-payroll.md` for federal mechanics. Quebec-specific deviations:

| Federal item | Quebec treatment |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **CPP** | **Does not apply** to Quebec-establishment employees. Use QPP instead. |
| **EI premiums** | Applies, but at the **Quebec-reduced rate** (lower than the rest-of-Canada rate). |
| **Federal income tax withholding** | Applies as usual (TD1, T4127). |
| **Quebec income tax withholding** | Separate — uses **TP-1015.3-V (TPD)** Quebec personal-exemption form and Revenu Québec's WebRAS calculator. |
| **T4** | Still issued for federal tax / EI; **RL-1** issued in parallel for Quebec (QPP, QPIP, HSF, Quebec tax). |
| **Federal remittance (PD7A)** | Still applies for federal tax, EI, CPP-or-its-Quebec-absence. Goes to CRA. |
| **Quebec remittance (TPZ-1015.R-V)** | Separate; goes to Revenu Québec. |
| **ROE (Record of Employment)** | Same as federal — issued through Service Canada. QPIP claims pull from the same ROE. |

**Bottom line:** a Quebec employer files **two** payroll-remittance streams — one to CRA (federal tax + EI) and one to Revenu Québec (Quebec tax + QPP + QPIP + HSF + WSDRF + integrated CNESST periodic remittance). The two streams must be kept reconciled.

---

## 9. Filing mechanics — Revenu Québec

### 9.1 Periodic remittance — TPZ-1015.R-V

| Average monthly Quebec source deductions | Remittance frequency |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| < $3,000 | **Quarterly** (or monthly, employer's choice) |
| $3,000 – $24,999.99 | **Monthly** (15th of following month) |
| $25,000 – $99,999.99 | **Twice-monthly** (25th + 10th) |
| ≥ $100,000 | **Weekly** (within 3 working days) |

> Thresholds mirror but do not exactly equal the federal CRA thresholds — Revenu Québec assigns the frequency independently based on the prior two years of Quebec remittance history. Always check the employer's **Avis de cotisation** for the assigned frequency.

The remittance includes (on a single voucher):
1. Quebec income tax withheld
2. Employee + employer QPP (incl. QPP2)
3. Employee + employer QPIP
4. Employer HSF
5. Employer WSDRF (if applicable)
6. Employer CNESST periodic remittance (if integrated)

### 9.2 Annual reconciliation

- **Sommaire 1 (RLZ-1.S-V)** — annual employer summary; due **last day of February** following the calendar year.
- **RL-1 slips** to each employee — same deadline (28/29 February).
- **CNESST Déclaration des salaires** — separate; due **14 March**.

### 9.3 Penalties (non-exhaustive)

- Late remittance: **7% / 11% / 15%** sliding penalty depending on lateness, plus interest.
- Failure to file RL-1 / Sommaire 1: **$25 per slip per day**, capped.
- Failure to file CNESST DAS: separate CNESST penalty regime plus interest.
- Negligence / gross negligence: up to **50%** penalty on under-withheld amounts.

## 10. Worked example — Montreal SaaS company, 8 employees, $800,000 payroll

**Facts.** *Acme SaaS inc.*, Quebec-incorporated, Montreal establishment, 8 software developers and 1 office manager. 2025 calendar-year payroll:

- 6 developers @ $95,000 = $570,000
- 2 senior developers @ $130,000 = $260,000
- 1 office manager @ $55,000 = $55,000
- **Total Quebec payroll = $885,000** (revised — using these illustrative numbers)
- For the "$800k" round number, assume total payroll = **$800,000**; we use that figure throughout for HSF and WSDRF.
- Sector: software publishing / SaaS — NAICS 5132 — **office / professional services CNESST classification**, assumed rate **0.18%** (illustrative; verify against actual CNESST classification).

**Step 1 — QPP.**
For each employee, compute base + additional (6.40% EE / 6.40% ER) on earnings $3,500 – $71,300, plus QPP2 (4.00% EE / 4.00% ER) on earnings $71,300 – $81,200.

- **Office manager (gross $55,000):** Pensionable base = $55,000 − $3,500 = $51,500. QPP first tier = 6.40% × $51,500 = **$3,296** EE + **$3,296** ER. No QPP2.
- **Developer (gross $95,000):** First-tier capped: 6.40% × ($71,300 − $3,500) = 6.40% × $67,800 = **$4,339.20** EE + **$4,339.20** ER. QPP2: 4.00% × ($81,200 − $71,300) = 4.00% × $9,900 = **$396** EE + **$396** ER. Total per developer: $4,735.20 EE + $4,735.20 ER. (Slight rounding vs. published $4,744.50 max — Retraite Québec applies a specific rounding convention; the maximum is published as $4,348.50 base+additional, which differs from 6.40% × $67,800 = $4,339.20 by a rounding/inclusion-of-the-cents convention. **Always use the official WebRAS calculator** for final figures.)
- **Senior developer (gross $130,000):** Both ceilings hit. Same maximum as the developer = **$4,735.20** EE + **$4,735.20** ER (approx; use WebRAS).

**Step 2 — QPIP.**
- Office manager ($55,000): 0.494% × $55,000 = **$271.70** EE; 0.692% × $55,000 = **$380.60** ER.
- Developer ($95,000, capped at $98,000): 0.494% × $95,000 = **$469.30** EE; 0.692% × $95,000 = **$657.40** ER.
- Senior developer ($130,000, capped at $98,000): 0.494% × $98,000 = **$484.12** EE; 0.692% × $98,000 = **$678.16** ER.

**Step 3 — HSF.**
Total Quebec payroll = $800,000 (< $1M) → HSF rate = **1.65%**.
- HSF = 1.65% × $800,000 = **$13,200**.

**Step 4 — CNESST.**
Assume CNESST rate = 0.18% (office/SaaS classification — illustrative).
- Insurable earnings, capped at $98,000/worker: developers and seniors capped at $98,000 each (6 + 2 = 8 workers × $98,000 = $784,000); office manager $55,000.
- Insurable wage base = $784,000 + $55,000 = $839,000.
- CNESST premium = 0.18% × $839,000 = **$1,510.20**.

> Note: in this worked example, salaries exceed total payroll because we used the $800,000 round figure for HSF/WSDRF but full $95k/$130k for per-employee QPP/QPIP. In a real engagement, reconcile so per-employee gross sums to total Quebec payroll exactly.

**Step 5 — WSDRF.**
Total Quebec payroll = $800,000. Threshold = $2,000,000. **Not subject.**

**Step 6 — Federal coordination.**
- Federal EI withheld at the **Quebec-reduced employee rate** plus 1.4× employer share — see `canada-payroll.md` §EI for current rates.
- Federal income tax withheld using TD1 + T4127.
- **No CPP withheld** (QPP replaces).

**Summary — annual employer cost of Quebec contributions (illustrative):**

| Contribution | Employer cost |
|--------------|---------------|
| QPP (employer match) | ≈ $35,000–$40,000 (sum of per-employee ER QPP) |
| QPIP (employer) | ≈ $5,000–$5,400 |
| HSF | $13,200 |
| CNESST | $1,510 |
| WSDRF | $0 (under threshold) |
| **Total Quebec employer cost** | **≈ $55,000** on $800k payroll (~6.9%) |

…on top of federal employer EI cost (Quebec-reduced rate × 1.4) and any group benefits.

## 11. Conservative defaults

When information is missing, default conservatively (i.e., assume the **higher** liability) and flag for verification:

- **CNESST rate**: if classification unit unknown, default to the sector's **upper-bound published rate** rather than the floor. Flag for CNESST classification confirmation.
- **HSF rate**: if total payroll is near a tier break (e.g., $999k vs. $1.01M), default to the **higher tier** until year-end actuals are known; refund/credit on Sommaire 1.
- **WSDRF**: if total payroll is within 5% of the $2M threshold, treat the employer as **subject** and recommend tracking training expenditures throughout the year.
- **Worker classification**: if employee-vs.-contractor is ambiguous, default to **employee** (more conservative for the employer — all five contributions apply). Document the basis and flag for legal review.
- **Establishment location**: if an employee works from home in a province other than Quebec but the employer's establishment is in Quebec, default to the **"establishment to which the employee reports"** rule — generally Quebec — and flag (refusal **R-QC-6**).
- **Remittance frequency**: if Revenu Québec has not yet notified, default to **monthly** until the Avis de cotisation arrives.
- **Annualized vs. period earnings**: always use Revenu Québec's **WebRAS** (Web ROD calculator) for per-pay-period figures rather than back-of-envelope annualization, which can over- or under-withhold near tier breaks.
