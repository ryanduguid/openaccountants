# Colorado Payroll Compliance Skill (Tax Year 2025)

## 1. Scope

This skill governs employer payroll obligations in the State of Colorado for
tax year 2025. It is a Tier 2 content skill and MUST be loaded alongside
`us-tax-workflow-base` v0.2 or later. It covers:

- Colorado Personal Income Tax (PIT) withholding at the 4.4% flat rate
  (Colorado Revised Statutes §39-22-104), including the supplemental
  withholding rate and the 2025 step-down from the historical 4.55% rate.
- The DR 1098 Colorado Employee Withholding Certificate (state analog of the
  federal Form W-4) and the optional use of the federal Form W-4 for
  Colorado purposes.
- The DR 1094 Annual Reconciliation of Income Tax Withheld and the DR 1093
  Annual Transmittal of State W-2s (commonly described as the "combined"
  annual filing in informal usage).
- Colorado State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) liability administered by the
  Colorado Division of Unemployment Insurance (CDLE-UI), including the 2025
  taxable wage base of $24,800, the experience-rated employer schedule
  (0.50% to 10.39%), the 1.70% new-employer rate for non-construction
  employers, and the support surcharge components.
- The Colorado Family and Medical Leave Insurance program ("FAMLI"), in
  effect for benefits since January 1, 2024 and continuing in 2025, with
  0.9% total payroll premium, employer/employee split rules, the 10-employee
  threshold, the $176,100 wage cap (Social Security wage base for 2025),
  and the 12-week leave entitlement.
- The Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA): 48 hours of accrued paid
  sick leave per year plus the Public Health Emergency (PHE) supplemental
  leave entitlement.
- The Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (EPEWA), Senate Bill 19-085 as amended
  by Senate Bill 23-105 (the "Ensure Equal Pay for Equal Work" amendments),
  including the salary range disclosure obligation and the new
  post-selection notice obligation effective January 1, 2024.
- Worker classification under Colorado's modified ABC test (C.R.S.
  §8-70-115(1)(b)) for unemployment-insurance purposes.
- Final pay timing rules under the Colorado Wage Act, C.R.S. §8-4-109.
- Construction industry compliance overlays: separate SUTA rate schedule,
  HB 19-1267 wage-theft criminal exposure, and the construction-employee
  retainage rules.

Out of scope:
- Federal income tax withholding, FICA, FUTA — see `us-federal-payroll`
  and `us-payroll-fundamentals`.
- Local occupational privilege taxes ("OPT" or "head taxes") imposed by
  Denver, Aurora, Glendale, Greenwood Village, and Sheridan — see
  `co-local-opt`. This skill mentions them only at the integration points.
- Workers' compensation insurance under C.R.S. §8-40-101 et seq.
- ERISA-governed retirement plans, except where the Colorado SecureSavings
  state mandate intersects with payroll. SecureSavings registration
  enforcement is addressed in `co-securesavings`.

## 2. Colorado Personal Income Tax Withholding

### 2.1 Statutory rate

Colorado imposes a flat personal income tax under C.R.S. §39-22-104(1.7).
The statutory headline rate was 4.55% from tax year 2020 through tax year
2021. Successive temporary reductions under the TABOR refund mechanism
(C.R.S. §39-22-627) and Proposition 121 (approved November 2022) reduced
the rate to 4.40% for tax years 2022 and forward.

For tax year 2025 the operative withholding rate is **4.40% flat**. The
Colorado Department of Revenue (CDOR) publishes the 2025 DR 1098
Withholding Worksheet and DR 1098 Employer's Withholding Tables using the
4.40% factor.

The supplemental withholding rate (used for bonuses, severance pay,
commissions and other non-regular wage payments when the aggregate method
is not elected) is also **4.40%** for 2025. Colorado does not, unlike the
federal system, have a separate higher supplemental rate.

Local note: Colorado may, contingent on TABOR refund triggers under C.R.S.
§39-22-627(3)(a), step the rate down further for a given tax year. For tax
year 2025 no such temporary further reduction was triggered as of the
last_updated date of this skill. Reviewers MUST confirm against CDOR's
current-year Income 70 publication if filing after the legislative session.

### 2.2 DR 1098: Colorado Employee Withholding Certificate

The DR 1098 is Colorado's state-equivalent of the federal Form W-4. Since
tax year 2022 CDOR has accepted a DR 1098 in lieu of using the federal
Form W-4 for Colorado withholding purposes. Employers MAY use either:

(a) The federal Form W-4 alone, with Colorado-specific allowances inferred
under the DR 1098 Worksheet, OR
(b) The DR 1098 itself, completed by the employee, OR
(c) Both, with the DR 1098 governing for Colorado purposes if the
employee chooses a different number of withholding allowances or
additional Colorado withholding amount than the federal W-4 implies.

The DR 1098 collects:
- Filing status (single; married filing jointly; married filing
  separately; head of household).
- Annual gross wages estimate (used by the worksheet).
- Number of dependent children under age 17 and other dependents.
- Other Colorado-specific income (interest, dividends, side income).
- Other Colorado adjustments (Colorado-source deductions).
- Other Colorado tax credits the employee expects to claim.
- An "Additional Colorado Withholding" line (analogous to W-4 step 4(c)).
- Optional exemption claim if the employee expects zero Colorado tax
  liability (analogous to the prior W-4 exemption claim, which the federal
  form no longer supports directly).

Employers retain the DR 1098 with payroll records and apply it to all
wage payments beginning with the first payroll on or after receipt. The
DR 1098 does NOT expire annually — it remains in effect until superseded
by a new one. Employees who claim exempt MUST refile by February 15 of
each subsequent year, mirroring federal W-4 exempt-claim mechanics.

AUDIT FLASH POINT — DR 1098 NEGLECT: Employers commonly default new hires
to "Single, zero allowances" using the federal W-4 only and never offer
the DR 1098. The CDOR position is that a properly completed federal W-4
is sufficient absent an employee request, but the employer's exposure on
over-withholding refund claims and on EPEWA recordkeeping audits is
materially lower when DR 1098s are retained in the employee file.
Workpapers MUST document which form is in use.

### 2.3 Withholding deposit cadence

Colorado withholding deposits are due based on aggregate withholding
liability over the look-back period:

- **Quarterly filer** — aggregate annual liability under $7,000. Deposit
  by the last day of the month following each calendar quarter (April 30,
  July 31, October 31, January 31).
- **Monthly filer** — aggregate annual liability between $7,000 and
  $50,000. Deposit by the 15th day of the following month.
- **Weekly filer** — aggregate annual liability $50,000 or more. Deposit
  within three business days of the wage payment date that triggered the
  weekly threshold.
- **Seasonal filer** — businesses with regular off-season months can
  apply for seasonal status; deposits only during active months.

All deposits and returns are submitted electronically through Revenue
Online unless CDOR has granted a paper-filing waiver. The remittance form
attached to each deposit is the DR 1094 in its periodic role (see §2.4).

### 2.4 DR 1094 (Annual Reconciliation) and DR 1093 (Transmittal)

Terminology in CDOR publications and in this skill:

- **DR 1094** — Colorado W-2 Wage Withholding Tax Return. This is BOTH
  (a) the periodic payment voucher accompanying each deposit, AND (b) the
  annual reconciliation form. The annual reconciliation reports total
  Colorado wages paid, total Colorado tax withheld per period, and any
  reconciliation adjustments. It is due **January 31** of the year
  following the wage year.

- **DR 1093** — Annual Transmittal of State W-2s. This accompanies the
  paper or electronic submission of Colorado W-2s (the Colorado copy of
  federal Form W-2). It is also due **January 31**.

In practice CDOR's Revenue Online accepts a combined annual filing that
satisfies both DR 1094 and DR 1093 in a single workflow. Practitioners
informally call this the "combined annual filing," which is the usage
adopted by the description in the frontmatter of this skill.

Penalties:
- Failure to file the annual reconciliation: $50 minimum penalty plus
  the higher of $5 per W-2 unreconciled or 5% of unreported withholding
  per month (capped at 12 months).
- Failure to deposit timely: 5% penalty plus 0.5% per month, plus
  interest at the CDOR statutory rate (subject to annual TABOR-adjusted
  rate publication; reviewers verify current rate).

## 3. Colorado State Unemployment Insurance (SUTA)

### 3.1 Coverage and registration

Colorado SUTA is administered by the Colorado Department of Labor and
Employment, Division of Unemployment Insurance ("CDLE-UI"), under C.R.S.
§8-70-101 et seq. An employer becomes subject to Colorado UI when ANY of
the following tests is met:

- Pays $1,500 or more in wages in any calendar quarter in the current or
  preceding calendar year (general employer test); OR
- Employs at least one worker in any portion of a day in 20 different
  calendar weeks in the current or preceding year (general employer
  test, alternative branch); OR
- Pays $1,000 or more in domestic-service wages in any calendar quarter
  (domestic employer test); OR
- Pays $20,000 or more in agricultural wages in any calendar quarter
  (agricultural employer test).

A subject employer registers via My UI Employer+ (the CDLE-UI portal).
Construction industry employers register on a separate workflow that
asserts construction status — this matters for the rate schedule
(see §3.4).

### 3.2 Taxable wage base for 2025

The Colorado SUTA taxable wage base for **2025 is $24,800** per employee
per calendar year. This is the maximum amount of wages per employee that
is subject to the SUTA premium, support surcharge, and bond assessments.
The wage base is indexed annually under C.R.S. §8-76-102.5; the 2024
base was $23,800.

### 3.3 Premium rate schedule

For 2025, experience-rated Colorado SUTA premium rates range from
**0.50% to 10.39%**, applied to the first $24,800 of each employee's
wages. The schedule is determined by the employer's reserve ratio
(reserve account balance divided by average annual taxable payroll) and
the overall UI Trust Fund solvency tier. The 2025 rate schedule was
published in the December 2024 CDLE rate notices.

New-employer rates:
- Non-construction new employer (first 3 years): **1.70%**.
- Construction new employer (first 3 years): published annually on a
  separate schedule that materially exceeds 1.70% (commonly in the
  3-5% range; reviewer to confirm against the 2025 rate notice).

Additional components layered on the base premium rate:
- **Support Surcharge** under C.R.S. §8-77-106: 0.22% in 2025
  (subject to annual adjustment; reviewer to confirm against current
  CDLE-UI rate notice).
- **Bond Assessment** under SB 20-207: not assessed for 2025 because
  the bond issued during the COVID Trust Fund solvency crisis was
  retired in 2023. Reviewers verify against the current rate notice
  before assuming zero.

Combined effective rate range for a new non-construction employer in
2025 is approximately 1.92% (1.70% premium + 0.22% surcharge), applied
to the $24,800 wage base, producing a per-employee maximum cost of
approximately $476.16 per year.

### 3.4 Construction industry overlay

Colorado treats construction employers as a separate experience pool
under C.R.S. §8-76-102.5(5). The construction new-employer rate is
substantially higher than the 1.70% non-construction rate because the
construction pool has historically had higher claim incidence. Employers
registering should self-identify on the My UI Employer+ portal with the
appropriate NAICS code in the 23xxxx range; misclassification of
industry sector to obtain the lower non-construction rate is fraud
under C.R.S. §8-81-101.

### 3.5 Quarterly reporting

The Colorado UI Premium Report and Wage Report are due:
- Q1 — April 30
- Q2 — July 31
- Q3 — October 31
- Q4 — January 31

Filing is electronic-only through MyUI Employer+. The wage report
itemizes each employee's gross wages for the quarter; the premium
report computes the SUTA owed using the employer's published rate and
the up-to-the-wage-base portion of each employee's wages.

## 4. Colorado FAMLI (Family and Medical Leave Insurance)

### 4.1 Program overview

Colorado's Paid Family and Medical Leave Insurance program ("FAMLI")
was created by Proposition 118 (November 2020), codified at C.R.S.
§8-13.3-501 et seq. Premium collection began January 1, 2023. Benefit
payments to employees on qualifying leave began **January 1, 2024**
and continue in 2025. The program is administered by the CDLE Division
of Family and Medical Leave Insurance ("CDLE-FAMLI").

FAMLI provides up to **12 weeks** of paid leave per benefit year for:
- Bonding with a new child (birth, adoption, foster placement);
- Caring for a family member with a serious health condition;
- The employee's own serious health condition;
- Qualifying military exigency;
- Safe leave for survivors of domestic violence, stalking, sexual
  assault, or abuse.

An additional 4 weeks (16 weeks total) is available for pregnancy or
childbirth complications.

The weekly benefit is wage-replacement on a progressive schedule: 90%
of the portion of the employee's average weekly wage at or below 50%
of the state AWW, plus 50% of the portion above. The 2025 maximum
weekly benefit is capped at $1,324.21 (90% of the 2025 Colorado
average weekly wage published by CDLE).

### 4.2 Premium: 0.9% total, employer/employee split

The total FAMLI premium is **0.9% of wages**, applied to the same wage
cap as the Social Security wage base. For 2025 the wage cap is
**$176,100**.

The default statutory split is **0.45% employee + 0.45% employer**, with
the employer required to deposit the full 0.9% to CDLE-FAMLI quarterly.
However:

- **Employers with fewer than 10 employees** are NOT required to pay
  the employer 0.45% share. They MUST still withhold and remit the
  employee's 0.45% share. The employer share is waived but the
  employee share is not.

- **Employers with 10 or more employees** owe the full 0.9% (0.45%
  employer + 0.45% employee withheld). The employer may voluntarily
  absorb the employee's share if it chooses (a common election among
  Colorado employers competing for talent).

The 10-employee count uses the **national** employee count, not the
Colorado-only headcount, and uses a rolling 20-week look-back analogous
to the federal FMLA 50-employee test. An employer that is 10+ for any
20 weeks (consecutive or not) in the calendar year is treated as a
10+ employer for the next premium year. Local-government employers
have unique opt-out rights under C.R.S. §8-13.3-522.

AUDIT FLASH POINT — 10-EMPLOYEE THRESHOLD MISCOUNT:

The single most common FAMLI compliance error is for an employer with
8-12 employees to assume they are exempt from the employer share
because they "feel small." The actual rules:

1. The count is total employees nationally, including part-time and
   seasonal workers, NOT FTE-adjusted and NOT Colorado-only.
2. Owners, partners, and members of an LLC are NOT counted as
   employees unless they receive W-2 wages.
3. The look-back is the prior calendar year's average headcount across
   20 weeks, not a point-in-time count.
4. Even employers under 10 MUST register, withhold the employee share,
   and file quarterly reports — only the EMPLOYER share is waived.
5. Crossing the 10-employee threshold mid-year does not retroactively
   make the employer responsible for the employer share for prior
   quarters of that year; the obligation activates the following
   premium year (the following January 1).

Workpapers MUST document the 20-week headcount computation and retain
the underlying payroll register snapshots that support the count. A
CDLE-FAMLI audit will request these directly.

### 4.3 Quarterly premium remittance

FAMLI premiums are remitted quarterly through My FAMLI+ Employer:
- Q1 — April 30
- Q2 — July 31
- Q3 — October 31
- Q4 — January 31

Filing is electronic-only above 10 employees. Below 10 employees,
paper filing is technically available but discouraged.

The quarterly filing reports each employee's FAMLI-subject wages
(gross wages up to $176,100 year-to-date per employee) and computes
the 0.9% premium (or 0.45% for employers under 10). Wages above the
$176,100 cap for an employee year-to-date are excluded.

### 4.4 Private plan substitution

An employer may apply to CDLE-FAMLI for approval to substitute a
private paid-leave plan that meets or exceeds FAMLI benefits and
costs no more to the employee than the FAMLI program. Approval is
on a one-year basis renewable annually; private-plan employers are
exempt from the 0.9% premium but pay a separate administrative fee
to CDLE-FAMLI. This skill does not deep-dive private plan
administration — refer to `co-famli-private-plan` (planned).

### 4.5 Job protection

An employee who has been employed by the same employer for at least
180 days at the time of leave commencement is entitled to job
protection (restoration to the same or equivalent position) on
return from FAMLI leave. This overlays but does not displace
federal FMLA — for employees eligible under both, the leaves run
concurrently and the more protective rule prevails.

## 5. Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (HFWA)

### 5.1 48-hour annual accrual

The Colorado Healthy Families and Workplaces Act (SB 20-205), C.R.S.
§8-13.3-401 et seq., requires every Colorado employer regardless of
size to provide paid sick leave.

Effective rules for tax year 2025:
- Employees accrue **1 hour of paid sick leave per 30 hours worked**.
- Maximum mandatory accrual is **48 hours per year**.
- Maximum carryover is **48 hours**.
- New hires may use accrued leave immediately (no 90-day wait).
- Sick leave is paid at the employee's regular rate.

Eligible uses:
- Employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition.
- Diagnosis, care, or treatment of same.
- Preventive care.
- Care for a covered family member.
- Safe leave (domestic abuse, sexual assault, stalking).
- School/childcare closure due to weather or public health.
- Bereavement.

### 5.2 Public Health Emergency (PHE) supplemental leave

When a federal, state, or local public health emergency is declared,
the HFWA requires employers to provide additional supplemental paid
leave on top of the 48 hours:
- **Up to 80 hours** for full-time employees (40+ hours/week).
- For part-time employees, the greater of (a) hours typically worked
  in a 14-day period, or (b) hours actually worked over the prior
  14 days, capped at 80 hours.

The PHE leave is available throughout the duration of the declared
emergency and for **four weeks after** its expiration. PHE leave is
a one-time pool per emergency, but it refreshes when a new
unrelated emergency is declared.

As of the last_updated date of this skill there is no active
statewide PHE in Colorado. Reviewers MUST confirm against CDLE
publications before excluding PHE supplemental leave from a payroll
configuration.

### 5.3 Notice, posting, and recordkeeping

Employers must:
- Provide written notice to each employee at hire describing HFWA
  rights (the CDLE-INFO 6B model notice satisfies this).
- Post the CDLE workplace poster (HFWA section) in each workplace
  and on any electronic platform employees regularly access.
- Maintain HFWA records (accrual, use, balance) for **two years** —
  not three, the general Colorado payroll record retention period.

## 6. Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (EPEWA)

### 6.1 Statutory framework

The Colorado Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, C.R.S. §8-5-101 et seq.,
was enacted by SB 19-085 effective January 1, 2021, and substantially
expanded by SB 23-105 ("Ensure Equal Pay for Equal Work") effective
**January 1, 2024**. Both provisions are in force for 2025.

### 6.2 Salary range disclosure

Every job posting for a position that could be performed in Colorado
(remote postings included if a Colorado-based employee could fill
the role) MUST include:

(a) The **hourly or salary compensation range** that the employer
    in good faith believes it will pay for the position. A range is
    permitted but must be a "good faith" range, not an arbitrary
    $0-$1,000,000 placeholder.
(b) A **general description of all benefits and other compensation**
    offered (health insurance summary level, retirement, equity
    summary, bonus structure, paid time off).
(c) The **application deadline** (or a statement that applications
    will be accepted on a rolling basis).

This disclosure obligation applies to:
- All external postings.
- All internal postings (with limited exceptions where the position
  is a "career progression" rather than a "job opportunity" —
  CDLE INFO 9 sets the test).
- Postings made by third-party recruiters and job boards on the
  employer's behalf.

### 6.3 Post-selection notice (new under SB 23-105)

Within **30 days** after a successful candidate begins work in a
posted position, the employer MUST notify employees who, at the
employer's discretion, have a "career progression" interest in
that position, of:
- The name of the successful candidate;
- Their former job title (if internal);
- Their new job title;
- Information on how employees may demonstrate interest in
  similar future opportunities.

This requirement is widely under-implemented and is the leading
EPEWA enforcement target as of 2025.

### 6.4 Pay-history prohibition

Employers MAY NOT:
- Ask applicants about wage-rate history.
- Rely on prior wage history to set offered compensation.
- Discriminate or retaliate against an applicant who declines to
  disclose prior wage history.

### 6.5 Penalties

EPEWA penalties under C.R.S. §8-5-203:
- $500 to $10,000 per violation (per posting, per failure-to-notice).
- Multiple postings of the same position can be aggregated as
  one violation at the Director's discretion.
- Civil action by aggrieved employees is also available for
  pay-equity violations.

AUDIT FLASH POINT — EPEWA POSTING NEGLECT:

The EPEWA salary-disclosure regime is enforced primarily by employee
and union complaints, not proactive audit. CDLE has assessed
five-figure aggregate penalties against multistate employers whose
"job posting on LinkedIn for a remote role open to Colorado" omitted
the salary range. Common failure modes:

1. Treating remote roles as out-of-scope because no specific
   Colorado office is designated — wrong. If the role COULD be filled
   by a Colorado-based employee, the disclosure applies.
2. Listing only "DOE" (depending on experience) instead of a range.
3. Listing a $0 to $X range with X arbitrarily high.
4. Posting the job range in the original posting but omitting it
   from the LinkedIn/Indeed amplifications.
5. Forgetting the post-selection notice obligation entirely.

Workpapers for an EPEWA risk assessment MUST review (a) a random
sample of 2025 postings, (b) the post-selection notice log, (c) the
internal-vs-external posting classification policy, and (d) the
job-board syndication process for range carry-through.

## 7. Worker Classification — Colorado ABC Test

### 7.1 The ABC test under C.R.S. §8-70-115

For Colorado unemployment-insurance purposes, a worker is presumed
to be an employee unless the putative employer can establish ALL
THREE of the following ("ABC test"):

A. The worker is **free from control and direction** in the
   performance of the service, both under the contract and in
   fact; AND

B. The service is performed outside the usual course of business
   of the person for whom the service is performed, OR is
   performed outside of all the places of business of the
   enterprise for which the service is performed; AND

C. The worker is **customarily engaged in an independent trade,
   occupation, profession, or business** related to the service
   performed.

Failure on any prong means the worker is an employee for SUTA,
FAMLI, and HFWA purposes.

### 7.2 The nine-factor safe harbor under §8-70-115(1)(c)

C.R.S. §8-70-115(1)(c) provides a documentary safe harbor: a
written contract that includes at least nine specified provisions
(e.g., the worker is not insurance-covered by the principal; pay
is by the job not by time; the worker provides own tools; etc.)
creates a rebuttable presumption of contractor status. However,
the actual conduct of the relationship can override the contract
language. The safe harbor is heavily contested in audits.

### 7.3 ABC vs federal common-law test

Colorado's ABC test is STRICTER than the federal IRS common-law
test used for federal employment-tax purposes. A worker can be a
contractor for IRS purposes (1099-NEC) and an employee for
Colorado SUTA / FAMLI / HFWA purposes simultaneously. This is a
common source of error in multistate practices: a worker properly
classified as a 1099 federally may still trigger Colorado
employer liability.

AUDIT FLASH POINT — ABC IN COLORADO:

The Colorado ABC test is one of the strictest in the United States
and substantially stricter than the federal common-law test. Common
failure modes:

1. Treating long-tenured "contractors" who work only for the
   principal as bona fide independent contractors — fails Prong C
   (not customarily engaged in an independent trade).
2. Treating a contractor who performs the same core services as
   the company's regular employees as a contractor — fails Prong B
   (within the usual course of business).
3. Relying on a contract with the nine §8-70-115(1)(c) clauses
   without conforming actual practice to the clauses.
4. Aggregating 1099 spend that exceeds the W-2 payroll base — a
   strong CDLE-UI audit trigger.
5. Reclassifying employees as contractors to avoid FAMLI premium
   collection — separate violation under FAMLI rules and
   triggers C.R.S. §8-13.3-516 retaliation exposure.

Workpapers for any Colorado contractor classification MUST walk
through ALL THREE prongs, not just rely on the contract template.

## 8. Final Pay and Wage Act

C.R.S. §8-4-109 governs final wages:

- **Discharge / involuntary termination** — All wages and
  compensation earned and unpaid at separation are due
  **immediately**. If the employer's accounting unit is not
  available (e.g., after-hours discharge), wages are due within
  **six hours** of the start of the accounting unit's next
  regular workday, OR within 24 hours if accounting is offsite.

- **Voluntary resignation** — Wages are due on the next regular
  payday.

- **PTO / vacation** — Earned and accrued vacation pay is
  treated as wages under C.R.S. §8-4-101(14)(a)(III) following
  Nieto v. Clark's Market (2021). It cannot be forfeited at
  termination, even under a "use it or lose it" policy, to the
  extent earned. PTO and vacation that has been earned but
  not used IS payable at separation; "front-loaded but
  unearned" leave can be subject to forfeiture rules in the
  employee handbook so long as those rules are clear and
  consistent.

- **HFWA sick leave** — NOT payable at separation, unless the
  employer voluntarily commits to pay it in the handbook.

Penalty for non-payment:
- A demand letter from the employee triggers a 14-day cure period.
- After 14 days, the employee may recover the unpaid wages PLUS a
  statutory penalty equal to the greater of (a) two times the
  unpaid amount, or (b) $1,000. Willful nonpayment doubles this
  to three times or $3,000.

## 9. Construction Industry Compliance Overlay

Construction industry employers in Colorado are subject to
several heightened payroll obligations:

- Separate SUTA rate pool (see §3.4).
- HB 19-1267: criminal wage-theft exposure — failure to pay
  wages with intent or reckless disregard is a Class 6 felony
  if the amount exceeds $2,000.
- Mechanic's lien retainage rules under C.R.S. §38-22-101 and
  prompt-payment statutes under C.R.S. §24-91-103 (public
  works) — these are not payroll but they affect when payroll
  cash is available.
- The Workers' Compensation Cost Containment Certificate (CCC)
  is broadly required in construction to maintain insurance
  rate stability.

This skill does NOT cover prevailing wage under Davis-Bacon or
Colorado HB 21-1264 (Colorado prevailing wage on certain public
projects) — see `co-prevailing-wage`.

## 10. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Colorado 5-employee creative agency (sub-10 FAMLI)

Facts:
- Single-member LLC operating as an S-corp in Denver, CO.
- 5 employees on W-2 (including the owner-employee at $80,000
  salary).
- 4 other employees at average $55,000 each.
- Total Colorado W-2 wages 2025: $80,000 + (4 × $55,000) = $300,000.
- Owner-employee on FAMLI applies because owner takes W-2.

Step 1 — Colorado PIT withholding:
- Aggregate Colorado withholding for 2025 (assuming no other state
  income, single filer for owner, married joint for others):
  approximately 4.40% × $300,000 = $13,200, less applicable DR 1098
  worksheet adjustments (~$1,500 in standard adjustments).
- Net annual Colorado withholding ≈ $11,700.
- Filing cadence: $11,700 is in the $7,000-$50,000 range, so
  **monthly** filing of DR 1094 deposits, due the 15th of the
  following month.
- Annual DR 1094 reconciliation due January 31, 2026.
- DR 1093 W-2 transmittal due January 31, 2026.

Step 2 — Colorado SUTA:
- All 5 employees exceed the $24,800 wage base.
- Taxable wages: 5 × $24,800 = $124,000.
- New-employer non-construction rate: 1.70%.
- Support surcharge: 0.22%.
- Combined: 1.92%.
- Annual SUTA: 1.92% × $124,000 = $2,380.80.
- Filed quarterly through MyUI Employer+.

Step 3 — FAMLI (sub-10 employer):
- 5 < 10 employees → employer share WAIVED.
- Employee share: 0.45% × $300,000 = $1,350 withheld from
  employees and remitted to CDLE-FAMLI.
- All employees under the $176,100 cap, so full wages subject.
- Quarterly remittance via My FAMLI+ Employer.
- Note: even though the employer share is waived, the employer
  MUST register and file quarterly returns. Skipping registration
  is a $50 per quarter penalty plus the unremitted employee share.

Step 4 — HFWA:
- All 5 employees accrue 1 hour per 30 hours worked.
- A full-time employee (40 hr/wk × 50 wk) accrues 66.67 hours,
  capped at the 48-hour annual maximum.
- Carryover into 2026: up to 48 hours per employee.

Step 5 — EPEWA:
- Any 2025 job postings must include salary range, benefits
  summary, application deadline.
- Post-selection notice within 30 days of each hire.

Aggregate Colorado payroll-tax burden for this employer:
- SUTA $2,380.80
- FAMLI employer share $0 (sub-10 exception)
- FAMLI employee share withheld $1,350 (employee-borne, not
  employer cost)
- Colorado withholding $11,700 (employee-borne)
- Total EMPLOYER cost: $2,380.80

### Example 2 — Colorado 50-employee tech company (full FAMLI)

Facts:
- Delaware C-corp with Colorado nexus, 50 W-2 employees in CO.
- Average salary $120,000. Total CO W-2 wages = $6,000,000.
- No employees over $176,100 (FAMLI cap), no employees over
  $24,800 wage base for SUTA (all are).
- Established employer with 2024 SUTA rate of 1.10%.

Step 1 — Colorado PIT withholding:
- Approx. 4.40% × $6,000,000 = $264,000, less DR 1098 worksheet
  adjustments (~$30,000) = ~$234,000 net.
- Filing cadence: > $50,000 → **weekly** filing, deposit within
  3 business days of each payroll.
- Annual DR 1094 reconciliation due January 31, 2026.

Step 2 — Colorado SUTA:
- Taxable wages: 50 × $24,800 = $1,240,000.
- Premium rate: 1.10% (experience-rated).
- Support surcharge: 0.22%.
- Combined: 1.32%.
- Annual SUTA: 1.32% × $1,240,000 = $16,368.

Step 3 — FAMLI (10+ employer):
- Full 0.9% applies.
- All employees below $176,100 cap, so full $6,000,000 in
  subject wages.
- Total FAMLI premium: 0.9% × $6,000,000 = $54,000.
- Split: $27,000 employer share + $27,000 employee share
  withheld from employee paychecks.
- Many tech employers in Colorado voluntarily absorb the
  employee share; if absorbed, total employer cost is $54,000.
- If standard split: employer cost $27,000.

Step 4 — HFWA:
- Same 1-hour-per-30-hours accrual, 48-hour cap.
- For a 40 hr/wk employee, the cap binds.
- No active PHE in 2025 as of skill date.

Step 5 — EPEWA exposure:
- High-volume hiring → high posting volume → highest EPEWA
  exposure of these examples.
- Post-selection notice obligation is the most-missed item.
- Recommend a posting-compliance checklist in the ATS workflow.

Aggregate Colorado employer payroll-tax burden:
- SUTA $16,368
- FAMLI employer share $27,000 (or $54,000 if absorbing
  employee share)
- Total EMPLOYER cost: $43,368 (standard split) or
  $70,368 (full absorb).

### Example 3 — Multistate employer (CO + TX + remote)

Facts:
- Texas-headquartered LLC taxed as S-corp.
- 20 employees total: 12 in TX, 5 in CO, 3 remote (one in
  WY, two in NM).
- Q: Which Colorado obligations apply?

Analysis:

Colorado PIT withholding:
- Withhold Colorado PIT only on the 5 CO-resident employees'
  Colorado-source wages. The 3 remote-state employees do NOT
  have Colorado withholding unless they perform services in
  Colorado.
- File DR 1094 quarterly or monthly based on the CO portion
  alone.

Colorado SUTA:
- Liable for SUTA on the 5 CO employees' wages up to $24,800
  each. The TX and remote employees are not Colorado SUTA
  wages.
- Register with CDLE-UI as a "foreign employer with Colorado
  operations."

Colorado FAMLI:
- **HEADCOUNT TEST IS NATIONAL**: 20 employees total ≥ 10,
  so the employer is a 10+ employer for FAMLI purposes.
- Premium applies only to CO employees' wages (FAMLI is a
  Colorado tax on Colorado work).
- 0.9% on 5 CO employees: employer 0.45% + employee 0.45%.
- This is the single most common multistate mistake — a CO
  employer with only 5 CO employees but 20 total is NOT a
  sub-10 employer for FAMLI purposes.

Colorado HFWA:
- Applies to all 5 CO employees.
- Does NOT apply to TX, WY, NM employees (state law-only).

EPEWA:
- Any job posting open to remote Colorado candidates MUST
  include CO salary disclosure even if HQ is in TX.
- This is the highest-risk multistate item.

ABC test:
- The 3 remote employees (WY, NM) are governed by their own
  state's ABC or common-law test. The 5 CO employees are
  governed by the strict Colorado ABC test.

Aggregate Colorado employer payroll-tax burden (CO portion only):
- Colorado PIT withholding: employee-borne, ~$22,000 routed
  to CDOR.
- SUTA: 1.92% × (5 × $24,800) = $2,380.80.
- FAMLI employer share: 0.45% × CO wages.
  Assuming $120k average × 5 = $600,000 CO wages, all
  below the cap → 0.45% × $600,000 = $2,700.
- Total CO-specific EMPLOYER cost: ~$5,080.80, plus EPEWA
  compliance overhead.

### Example 4 — Sub-10 employer crossing the threshold mid-year

Facts:
- Boulder-based startup begins 2025 with 8 employees.
- Hires aggressively and reaches 12 employees by August 2025.
- Q: When does the 10+ FAMLI employer share liability begin?

Analysis:
- The FAMLI 10-employee threshold uses a 20-week look-back over
  the **prior** calendar year for the **current** year's
  classification.
- Because the startup averaged 8 employees in 2024 (prior year),
  it is a sub-10 employer for ALL of 2025, regardless of the
  August jump.
- However, for 2026 classification: count the 2025 average over
  20 weeks. If the startup is at 10+ for any 20 weeks in 2025
  (almost certainly true given the August jump), it is a 10+
  employer for 2026 and owes the employer 0.45% beginning
  January 1, 2026.
- Workpaper MUST document the 2025 20-week count to support
  the 2026 classification.

Aggregate 2025 employer FAMLI cost: $0 employer share, employee
share still withheld throughout.

## 12. Self-Checks Before Sign-Off

Before producing reviewer output that incorporates this skill's content,
verify:

1. The 4.40% PIT rate is correct for the tax year in scope, and the
   TABOR-trigger temporary further reduction has not been activated.
2. The SUTA wage base $24,800 and rate schedule 0.50%-10.39% are
   current; confirm against the latest CDLE-UI rate notice.
3. The FAMLI 10-employee threshold has been computed using national
   headcount and the 20-week look-back, with the underlying payroll
   register snapshots retained.
4. EPEWA job posting compliance has been reviewed for any 2025
   postings, including remote postings open to Colorado.
5. ABC test analysis for any 1099 contractors with Colorado nexus has
   walked through ALL THREE prongs, not just relied on contract
   language.
6. Final pay timing is correct for the separation type (discharge vs
   resignation).
7. The construction-industry overlay has been considered if the
   employer's NAICS is in the 23xxxx range.
8. Local OPT (Denver, Aurora, Glendale, Greenwood Village, Sheridan)
   has been considered for employees working in those jurisdictions
   — out of scope of this skill but in scope of the workflow.

## 13. Refusal Catalogue (Colorado Payroll Specific)

R-CO-PAY-1: Do not advise reclassifying employees as contractors
solely to avoid FAMLI premium — violates C.R.S. §8-13.3-516
anti-retaliation provision.

R-CO-PAY-2: Do not advise omitting salary range from a Colorado-
visible job posting — EPEWA $500-$10,000 per-violation exposure.

R-CO-PAY-3: Do not advise "front-loading and clawing back" vacation
to defeat Nieto v. Clark's Market — Colorado Wage Act forbids
forfeiture of earned vacation.

R-CO-PAY-4: Do not advise withholding Colorado tax from a non-
resident remote employee who performs no services in Colorado;
this creates an over-withholding compliance posture for the
employee.

R-CO-PAY-5: Do not advise treating the FAMLI threshold as
Colorado-only headcount — it is national.

## 14. Citation Discipline

Citations in workpapers produced from this skill MUST identify:

- C.R.S. section number for substantive statutory rules.
- CDOR DR-number for forms and the relevant Income tax publication
  (Income 70 for withholding; FYI Income 11 for Colorado source
  income).
- CDLE INFO number for HFWA (INFO 6B), EPEWA (INFO 9), and FAMLI
  (INFO 17 series) interpretive guidance.
- The case name and citation for Nieto v. Clark's Market, 488 P.3d
  1140 (Colo. 2021) when discussing vacation forfeiture.

When citing a 2025 rate, identify the source publication date and
the URL or document reference. Reviewers must verify rates against
the live CDOR/CDLE publications before sign-off because Colorado
revenue rates change with TABOR triggers and the SUTA schedule
publishes annually.

## 15. Skill Slot Contract

This skill SATISFIES the `state-payroll` slot for jurisdiction US-CO
in the us-tax-workflow-base v0.2 workflow. It DEPENDS ON:

- `us-tax-workflow-base` v0.2 or later (workflow architecture).
- `us-payroll-fundamentals` (federal payroll baseline; planned).

It is COMPLEMENTED BY (load alongside for full Colorado payroll):
- `co-income-tax` (employee/owner-side Colorado PIT — already in
  the package).
- `co-local-opt` (Denver/Aurora/Glendale/Greenwood Village/Sheridan
  occupational privilege taxes; planned).
- `co-securesavings` (state retirement registration mandate;
  planned).
- `co-prevailing-wage` (HB 21-1264 prevailing wage; planned).

End of co-payroll v0.1.
