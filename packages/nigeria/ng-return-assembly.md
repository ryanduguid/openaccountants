  Use this skill whenever asked to assemble, finalize, or package a Nigerian annual tax return.
  Trigger on phrases like "assemble Nigerian return", "Nigeria SPT package", "final review
  Nigerian tax", "FIRS Tax Pro-Max submission", "year-end Nigeria", "prepare CIT return",
  "prepare PIT return", "Nigeria filing package", "Form A annual return", "Form H1 reconciliation",
  or "Nigerian working paper". This is the capstone orchestrator that pulls together outputs
  from ng-cit, ng-personal-income-tax, ng-paye, ng-statutory-deductions, ng-wht, ng-cgt,
  ng-vat, ng-payroll, and ng-formation into a single unified working paper plus payment and
  filing instructions. It does not recompute anything itself — it reconciles upstream outputs,
  builds the line-by-line return working paper, generates Tax Pro-Max / Remita payment
  instructions, and produces a reviewer brief and taxpayer action list.
  ALWAYS read this skill last — it's the capstone.

# Nigeria — Return Assembly (Capstone) — Skill v1.0

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, the user has already passed through intake and the relevant content skills. They want their finished Nigerian return working paper. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

Specifically:

- **Do NOT ask "do you want me to assemble the full package".** The user asked for the return. Produce it.
- **Do NOT re-interrogate the user about residency, TIN, RC number, or business structure** — intake already captured this; trust the upstream packages.
- **Do NOT pause between reconciliation steps to check in.** Run all cross-checks in sequence; flag failures in the reviewer brief and continue.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** If a check fails, note it under "Reviewer Attention Flags" and continue.
- **Do NOT submit anything to FIRS Tax Pro-Max or any State IRS portal.** This skill produces a working paper plus filing instructions. A Chartered Accountant in Nigeria (ICAN or ANAN member) must review, and the taxpayer (or authorised filer) submits via the relevant portal.

**If you feel the urge to ask "how should I proceed", pick the most defensible path, proceed, and flag the decision for the reviewer.**

## What this file is

The final capstone skill for Nigerian annual tax returns. It consumes the outputs of every other Nigeria skill and assembles a single unified working paper covering either:

- **Personal Income Tax (PIT) Form A** — annual return for resident individuals (including sole proprietors), filed with the relevant **State Internal Revenue Service** (SIRS / LIRS for Lagos, FCT-IRS for Abuja, etc.) under the Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) as amended
- **Companies Income Tax (CIT) Self-Assessment Return** — annual return for resident companies (RC), filed with the **Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS)** under the Companies Income Tax Act (CITA) as amended, supplemented by **Tertiary Education Tax (TET)** under the Tertiary Education Trust Fund Act, and where applicable the new **Development Levy** introduced by the Nigeria Tax Act 2025

The output is a reviewer-ready package: line-by-line return working paper, cross-skill reconciliation table, payment instructions (Tax Pro-Max billing reference and Remita RRR), filing instructions for federal and state portals, reviewer checklist, and taxpayer action list.

## Section 2 — Required inputs from upstream skills

The assembly skill does not recompute anything. It expects structured outputs from the following upstream skills. If an upstream skill did not run, the assembly notes the gap and continues with available data.

### 2.1 Individual return (PIT Form A) — inputs

| Upstream skill | Output consumed | Where it lands on Form A |
|---|---|---|
| `ng-personal-income-tax` | Chargeable income computation: gross income, allowable deductions, consolidated relief allowance (CRA), reliefs, PIT due at graduated rates | Form A Parts B, C, D |
| `ng-paye` | Employment income from employer Form H1; PAYE already deducted at source via monthly Form G | Form A Part B (employment income); credit for PAYE in Part D |
| `ng-statutory-deductions` | Pension (8% employee contribution), NHF (2.5%), NHIS, life assurance premium — all reducing chargeable income | Form A Part C (reliefs and allowances) |
| `ng-wht` | WHT credit notes received as a recipient (e.g., 5%/10% on professional fees, rent, royalties, dividends, interest) | Form A Part D (tax credits) |
| `ng-cgt` | Capital gains tax computation on chargeable assets disposed of in the year (10% rate under CGTA) | Filed separately on CGT return; cross-referenced in Form A net worth schedule |
| `ng-vat` | If sole proprietor is VAT-registered: monthly VAT return position; cross-check of turnover only | Cross-check, not on Form A directly |
| `ng-payroll` | Sole proprietor as employer: PAYE for staff, pension remittance, NHF — supports the H1 the proprietor files | Separate Form H1; supports Form A Part C if proprietor's own pension contribution exists |
| `ng-formation` | Business registration evidence: CAC BN number (sole proprietor) or RC number (if incorporated and individual is director); TIN | Identity section of Form A |

### 2.2 Corporate return (CIT Self-Assessment) — inputs

| Upstream skill | Output consumed | Where it lands on the CIT return |
|---|---|---|
| `ng-cit` | Adjusted profit, capital allowances claimed, taxable profit, CIT at applicable rate (30% large, 20% medium, 0% small under CITA + Finance Acts; NTA 2025 changes apply from FY 2026), Tertiary Education Tax at 3% of assessable profits, Development Levy where applicable | Tax Pro-Max CIT return Schedules |
| `ng-paye` | Employee payroll cost classification; PAYE remittance evidence | Operating expenses section; supports Form H1 filing |
| `ng-statutory-deductions` | Employer pension (10%), NHF, NHIS, ITF (1% of payroll), NSITF (1% of payroll) — all deductible business expenses | Operating expenses; ITF/NSITF compliance certificates required for CAC and tax clearance |
| `ng-wht` | WHT deducted from company on dividends/interest received and on contracts (credit notes); WHT the company remitted as a withholding agent (compliance only) | Schedule of WHT credits; reconciliation to monthly remittances |
| `ng-cgt` | CGT on chargeable assets disposed in the year (10% rate) | Separate CGT return; cross-referenced |
| `ng-vat` | Monthly VAT return position; VAT paid is not creditable against CIT; non-recoverable input VAT is a cost in the P&L | Cross-check; non-recoverable input VAT flows into P&L expenses |
| `ng-payroll` | Full payroll cost classification; supports Form H1 and monthly Form G | Operating expenses; supports H1 |
| `ng-formation` | CAC registration evidence (RC number); FIRS TIN; SCUML if applicable; ITF / NSITF compliance certificates | Identity section of CIT return; required for Tax Clearance Certificate |

### 2.3 Intake-required identifiers

| Identifier | Required for |
|---|---|
| TIN (Tax Identification Number) — 10-digit, FIRS-issued for companies, JTB/State-issued for individuals (unified TIN under NTA 2025) | All returns |
| RC Number (Registration Number) — issued by Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) for companies | CIT return |
| BN Number (Business Name) — issued by CAC for sole proprietors / partnerships | PIT return if trading under a business name |
| NIN (National Identity Number) — NIMC-issued, now linked to individual TIN | PIT return |
| Employer Code — issued by State IRS for PAYE / Form G filing | All payroll filings |
| State of Residence — determines which State IRS has jurisdiction for PIT (PITA First Schedule "place of residence" rule) | PIT return — critical, drives filing portal |
| LGA (Local Government Area) of residence | PIT return supplementary |
| Pension PIN (PenCom-issued RSA PIN) | Pension reliefs and remittance evidence |

If any identifier is missing, the assembly skill flags it as "Needs Input" and produces the working paper with placeholders rather than halting.

### 2.4 Federal vs State coordination

Nigeria has a **bifurcated** tax administration:

- **Federal (FIRS):** CIT, TET, VAT, WHT on companies, CGT on companies, Stamp Duties on certain instruments, Petroleum Profits Tax (out of scope), Development Levy (NTA 2025).
- **State (SIRS):** PIT including PAYE remittance, CGT on individuals, business premises levy, development levies (state), road tax, withholding tax on individuals (5% of contract payments to individuals).

The capstone produces **separate filing packs** for federal and state. A single individual sole proprietor may have BOTH a federal VAT obligation (FIRS) AND a PIT obligation (State IRS). The assembly cross-references both.

---

## Section 3 — Tax computation reconciliation

The assembly skill verifies that numbers from the upstream skills are mutually consistent. If a cross-check fails by more than **₦1,000**, the discrepancy is raised in the reviewer brief — never silently rounded.

### Cross-check 1 — Revenue reconciliation (turnover ties across skills)

| Source | Figure | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Bookkeeping / management accounts gross revenue | Total operating revenue | Anchor figure |
| `ng-vat` annual taxable supplies | Sum of monthly VAT 002 output Box | Must reconcile to bookkeeping revenue ± permitted timing differences and VAT-exempt revenue |
| `ng-cit` (corporates) / `ng-personal-income-tax` (individuals) gross income | Top line of fiscal computation | Must equal bookkeeping ± fiscal-vs-accounting adjustments |
| `ng-wht` (as recipient) — contract values from WHT credit notes received | Implicit gross from WHT credits ÷ WHT rate | Should reconcile to a subset of bookkeeping revenue |

**If mismatch:** Likely causes are (i) VAT-exempt or zero-rated supplies not in VAT output, (ii) cash vs accrual timing, (iii) intra-group eliminations, (iv) revenue subject to final WHT (rent, royalties to individuals) not in the same bucket.

### Cross-check 2 — Tax credits add up correctly

For individuals (Form A):

| Line | Source skill | Description |
|---|---|---|
| PAYE deducted by employer(s) | ng-paye (Form H1 from employer) | Credit |
| WHT on professional fees / rent / royalties / dividends / interest received | ng-wht (credit notes) | Credit |
| Provisional tax paid (instalments under PITA Section 44) | ng-personal-income-tax | Credit |
| Foreign tax credit (where DTT exists or unilateral relief under PITA Section 38) | ng-personal-income-tax | Credit, capped at Nigerian PIT on same income |

For corporates (CIT):

| Line | Source skill | Description |
|---|---|---|
| WHT suffered on contracts, rent, dividends, interest (FIRS / SIRS credit notes) | ng-wht | Credit |
| Provisional tax / advance CIT paid | ng-cit | Credit |
| Foreign tax credit (CITA Section 44 — DTT or unilateral relief) | ng-cit | Credit, capped |
| Excess Dividend Tax (EDT) prior-year offset under CITA Section 19 | ng-cit | If applicable |

**Rule:** Total credits cannot exceed tax payable for refund purposes unless excess is supported by valid FIRS/SIRS credit notes with verifiable serial numbers. WHT credit notes have a 6-year shelf life under Section 78A CITA (introduced by Finance Act 2019), but practical FIRS verification is shorter — flag any credit note older than 3 years for confirmation.

### Cross-check 3 — PAYE reconciliation between annual H1 and monthly Form G

| Item | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Sum of monthly Form G PAYE remitted (Jan–Dec 2025) | ng-paye / ng-payroll | Should equal total PAYE in Form H1 |
| Form H1 total PAYE | ng-paye | Annual reconciliation |
| Form H1 due date | Fixed | **31 January 2026** |
| Late-filing penalty | PITA Section 81(3) | ₦500,000 (company) or ₦50,000 (individual employer) per month |

**If mismatch:** Likely cause is mid-year joiners/leavers, bonus / 13th-month paid in December not captured in monthly remittance, or PAYE on benefits-in-kind only recognised at year-end.

### Cross-check 4 — Statutory deductions remittance compliance

| Item | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Pension — 18% combined (10% employer + 8% employee) of monthly emoluments | ng-statutory-deductions | Must be remitted to RSA PFA within 7 working days of salary payment (PRA 2014 Section 11(3)) |
| NHF — 2.5% of basic salary (employees earning ≥ ₦3,000/month) | ng-statutory-deductions | Remitted monthly to FMBN |
| NHIS — varies by scheme | ng-statutory-deductions | Monthly |
| ITF — 1% of total annual payroll (employers with ≥ 5 employees or ≥ ₦50M turnover) | ng-statutory-deductions | Due by **1 April 2026** |
| NSITF — 1% of total annual payroll (employers ≥ 5 employees) | ng-statutory-deductions | Monthly within 14 days; annual reconciliation |

**Compliance certificates required for FIRS Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC):**
- ITF Compliance Certificate
- NSITF Compliance Certificate
- PenCom Compliance Certificate
- NHF Compliance Certificate

Missing any of these blocks TCC issuance, which in turn blocks government contracts, visa applications, and bank loans. **Flag any missing certificate in the reviewer brief.**

### Cross-check 5 — WHT compliance as a withholding agent

If the taxpayer (especially a company) is required to withhold tax on its suppliers:

| Item | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| WHT on contracts paid (5% companies, 5%/10% individuals) | ng-wht | Remitted monthly by 21st of following month (FIRS for companies; State IRS for individuals) |
| WHT on rent paid (10%) | ng-wht | Monthly |
| WHT on professional fees (10% individuals, 5% companies) | ng-wht | Monthly |
| WHT on dividends, interest, royalties (10%, sometimes final) | ng-wht | Monthly |
| WHT credit notes issued to suppliers | ng-wht | Must be issued promptly; failure exposes principal to disallowance of expense (Section 81 CITA / Section 73 PITA) |

**Rule:** Withholding is the entity's obligation, not its own tax credit. Failure to withhold can result in (a) penalty of ₦500,000 (company) or ₦50,000 (individual) plus 10% of unremitted amount, and (b) disallowance of the underlying expense. Flag any apparent failure for the reviewer.

### Cross-check 6 — VAT-to-CIT/PIT consistency (for VAT-registered taxpayers)

| Item | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Output VAT (7.5% on taxable supplies) | ng-vat | NOT income — held in trust for FIRS |
| Input VAT recoverable | ng-vat | NOT a cost in fiscal P&L — netted against output |
| Input VAT non-recoverable (e.g., on overhead before VAT Modification Order rules) | ng-vat | IS a cost in fiscal P&L |
| VAT on imported services (reverse charge per Finance Act 2020) | ng-vat | Self-account; reverse charge entries must reconcile |

**If inconsistency:** An expense net of VAT in the P&L while the VAT was also not claimed on the VAT return means the VAT is lost. Flag for reviewer.

### Cross-check 7 — Capital allowances (companies) and CGT (both)

| Item | Source | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| Capital allowances claimed in CIT computation | ng-cit | Cannot exceed 66 2/3% of assessable profits for non-manufacturing companies (CITA Section 31 / Second Schedule); manufacturing companies have no cap |
| Tax Written Down Value (TWDV) roll-forward | ng-cit | Opening TWDV + additions − initial + annual allowances = closing TWDV |
| CGT on chargeable assets disposed | ng-cgt | 10% on net gain; CGTA Section 2; principal private residence and certain shares exempt |
| Roll-over relief claimed | ng-cgt | Confirm CGTA Section 32 conditions met |

**Note:** NTA 2025 introduces revised capital allowance rates and an updated definition of "qualifying capital expenditure" effective 1 January 2026 — this does NOT affect FY 2025 computations but must be flagged in 2026 planning.

### Cross-check 8 — Tolerance discipline

For every cross-check above, the threshold is **₦1,000**. If a difference is between ₦1,000 and ₦100,000, document the variance and proceed with a reviewer flag. If above ₦100,000, raise as "Needs Input" — the reviewer should resolve before sign-off.

---

| | 13 | Pension contribution (8% employee or self-employed equivalent) | ng-statutory-deductions |
| | 14 | NHF (2.5%) | ng-statutory-deductions |
| | 15 | Life assurance premium | ng-statutory-deductions |
| | 16 | NHIS | ng-statutory-deductions |

### 5.4 NTA 2025 transitional note for companies

The Nigeria Tax Act 2025 (effective 1 January 2026) introduces sweeping changes that do NOT apply to FY 2025 but must be flagged for FY 2026:

- **Development Levy at 4%** consolidating TET (3%), NITDA (1%), and NASENI (0.25%) into a single levy
- **Small company threshold raised** to ₦100M annual turnover (currently ₦25M)
- **CIT rate reduced to 25%** for large companies (down from 30%)
- **Minimum Effective Tax Rate (MEFR) of 15%** for multinational groups with ≥ €750M consolidated revenue (Pillar Two adoption)
- **VAT rate** to remain at 7.5% in 2026 (NTA 2025 left the rate untouched after political pushback on proposed increase)
- **Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS)** replaces FIRS as the federal tax authority
- Unified TIN regime
- Digital services tax updates

The 2026 planning section of the reviewer brief flags every NTA 2025 item materially affecting the taxpayer.

## Section 6 — Payment instructions: Tax Pro-Max, Remita, Treasury Single Account

Nigerian tax payments flow through the **Treasury Single Account (TSA)** via the **Remita** payment platform. The taxpayer logs into Tax Pro-Max, the system generates an **assessment** and an associated **billing reference / Remita Retrieval Reference (RRR)**, the taxpayer pays the RRR via bank channel (any commercial bank, internet banking, mobile banking, USSD, or POS), and Remita issues a payment receipt that auto-feeds back to Tax Pro-Max as **payment evidence**.

### 6.1 Tax types and FIRS / State channels

| Tax | Authority | Portal / Form | Payment channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| CIT | FIRS (federal) | Tax Pro-Max — CIT Self-Assessment | Remita RRR → bank → TSA |
| TET | FIRS | Tax Pro-Max — TET module | Same |
| VAT | FIRS | Tax Pro-Max — VAT Form 002 (monthly) | Same |
| WHT (companies) | FIRS | Tax Pro-Max — WHT module | Same |
| PAYE | State IRS (LIRS, FCT-IRS, RIRS, etc.) | State portal (e.g., eTax LIRS) — Form G monthly, Form H1 annual | State-specific Remita / portal payment |
| PIT (individual annual) | State IRS | State portal — Form A | Same |
| WHT (individuals) | State IRS | State portal | Same |
| CGT (companies) | FIRS | Tax Pro-Max | Same |
| CGT (individuals) | State IRS | State portal | Same |
| ITF Levy | ITF | ITF portal | Direct |
| NSITF | NSITF | NSITF portal | Direct |
| Pension | PenCom (regulator) → PFA (custodian) | RSA via PFA | Bank transfer to PFA custodian |
| NHF | FMBN | FMBN portal | Direct |

### 6.2 Tax Pro-Max → Remita → TSA flow

1. Log into Tax Pro-Max with TIN + password (or FIRS-issued digital certificate for high-volume filers)
2. Select tax type (CIT, TET, VAT, WHT) and period (year of assessment / month)
3. Enter computation OR upload XML / spreadsheet (Tax Pro-Max accepts bulk upload templates)
4. Submit — system generates **Assessment Notice** and **Billing Reference Number (BRN)**
5. Tax Pro-Max generates Remita RRR (15-digit) tied to the BRN
6. Pay the RRR via:
   - Any commercial bank teller (cash/cheque/bank transfer)
   - Internet banking (most Tier-1 banks integrate Remita)
   - Mobile banking app
   - USSD (Remita short code per bank)
   - POS at FIRS office
7. Bank confirms payment → Remita issues e-receipt with **Remita Transaction Reference (RTR)** + **Tax Pro-Max payment evidence**
8. Tax Pro-Max marks the assessment as **settled**; the corresponding return becomes filed (or filing is now actionable if payment was required first)

### 6.3 Tax Pro-Max payment timing relative to filing

| Payment | Due date | Filing reference |
|---|---|---|
| CIT — FY ending 31 December 2025 | **30 June 2026** (CITA Section 55) | Self-Assessment Return |
| TET — FY ending 31 December 2025 | **30 June 2026** (paid with CIT) | Within CIT return |
| VAT monthly (December 2025) | **21 January 2026** | VAT 002 |
| WHT monthly (December 2025 deductions) | **21 January 2026** | WHT schedule |
| PAYE monthly (December 2025) | **10 January 2026** (PITA Section 81; 10th of following month) | Form G |
| PIT annual (individual) | **31 March 2026** (PITA Section 41 — 90 days after year-end) | Form A |
| Employer annual PAYE reconciliation | **31 January 2026** | Form H1 |
| ITF Levy (FY 2025) | **1 April 2026** | ITF annual return |
| NSITF (December 2025) | **14 January 2026**; annual reconciliation also due | Monthly |
| Pension (December 2025 salary) | Within 7 working days of salary payment | RSA contribution schedule |

**Rule:** For CIT, FIRS practice is to require payment evidence (RTR) to be uploaded before the Self-Assessment Return is treated as accepted. Plan to settle BEFORE the formal submission step — or in two instalments per CITA Section 77 (one with provisional return at 3 months, balance with final return).

### 6.4 Provisional / instalment CIT under CITA Section 77

CITA Section 77 permits payment in instalments:

- **Option 1 (Single payment):** Pay full CIT liability on filing date (or on or before due date if filing earlier)
- **Option 2 (Instalments):** Up to **6 monthly instalments** with FIRS approval; first instalment with the return, subsequent monthly. **2% interest** applies on outstanding balance.

For provisional tax (where statute requires), the company pays an estimate within 3 months of year-end and trues up at filing. FIRS practice is increasingly tolerant of single-payment-at-filing where the company is a "good standing" taxpayer.

### 6.5 Payment evidence to retain

| Document | Issued by | Retain for |
|---|---|---|
| Remita RRR | Tax Pro-Max | Until settled |
| Remita e-Receipt (RTR) | Remita | Indefinite — proof of payment |
| Tax Pro-Max Payment Confirmation | FIRS | Indefinite |
| Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) | FIRS / State IRS | 12-month validity; renew annually |
| Compliance Certificates (ITF, NSITF, PenCom, NHF) | Respective agencies | 12-month validity each |

## Section 7 — Filing instructions

### 7.1 Federal (FIRS) filings via Tax Pro-Max

| Channel | Description | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **Tax Pro-Max Web — Direct Entry** | Fill the return directly in browser | Small / medium taxpayers |
| **Tax Pro-Max Web — Bulk Upload** | Upload FIRS-template Excel / XML | Larger taxpayers, multi-line schedules |
| **Tax Pro-Max API** | Direct integration for ERP / accounting software | Big-4 / multinational filers |

Submission steps (CIT example):

1. **Prepare** — finalise audited accounts, sign-off by directors and external auditors (ICAN-registered)
2. Log into Tax Pro-Max (TIN + password)
3. Navigate to **CIT → File Return → Year of Assessment 2026 (relating to FY 2025)**
4. Enter / upload computation; attach audited financial statements (PDF), tax computation (PDF/XLSX), capital allowances schedule, and compliance certificates
5. Validate — Tax Pro-Max runs arithmetic checks; resolve errors
6. **Submit return** → system generates Assessment Notice + Remita RRR
7. **Pay** the RRR (or set up instalment plan if applicable)
8. After payment, retrieve **filed-and-paid acknowledgement** — this is proof of compliance and is the basis for Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC) application
9. Apply for TCC for the year (separate Tax Pro-Max workflow)

### 7.2 State (SIRS) filings — example: LIRS eTax

Each State IRS operates its own portal; LIRS is the largest. General pattern:

1. Log into State IRS portal (e.g., https://etax.lirs.net for Lagos)
2. Navigate to **Annual Returns → Form A (Individuals)** or **Annual Returns → Form H1 (Employers)**
3. Enter income, deductions, reliefs, credits
4. Upload supporting documents (payslips, WHT credit notes, business accounts for sole proprietors)
5. Submit → portal generates Assessment Notice + Remita RRR for any balance
6. Pay via Remita
7. Retrieve filing acknowledgement → basis for State TCC

### 7.3 Deadlines summary (tax year 2025 / year of assessment 2026)

| Filer type | Return | Authority | Deadline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Individual (resident) | Form A (annual PIT) | State IRS | **31 March 2026** (PITA Section 41) |
| Employer | Form H1 (annual PAYE reconciliation) | State IRS | **31 January 2026** (PITA Section 81) |
| Employer | Form G (monthly PAYE) | State IRS | **10th of following month** |
| Company | CIT Self-Assessment (FY 31 Dec 2025) | FIRS | **30 June 2026** (CITA Section 55 — 6 months after FYE) |
| Company | TET (with CIT) | FIRS | **30 June 2026** |
| VAT-registered taxpayer | VAT Form 002 (monthly) | FIRS | **21st of following month** |
| Withholding agent | WHT monthly schedule | FIRS (companies) / State IRS (individuals) | **21st of following month** (FIRS) / **10th** (State) |
| Sole proprietor | Form A + Schedule 2 (business income) | State IRS | **31 March 2026** |
| ITF | Annual contribution | ITF | **1 April 2026** |
| NSITF | Annual reconciliation | NSITF | **31 March 2026** |

### 7.4 Late filing penalties

| Filer | Tax | Penalty | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Company | CIT late filing | ₦25,000 first month + ₦5,000 per additional month | CITA Section 55(3) |
| Company | CIT late payment | 10% of unpaid tax + interest at CBN MPR + 5% per annum | CITA Section 85 |
| Company | TET late | Same as CIT proportionally | TET Act |
| Employer | Form H1 late | ₦500,000 (corporate) / ₦50,000 (individual employer) | PITA Section 81(3) |
| Individual | Form A late | ₦5,000 + ₦100 per day of default | PITA Section 94 |
| VAT-registered | VAT late filing | ₦50,000 first month + ₦25,000 per additional month | VAT Act Section 19 (Finance Act 2020) |
| WHT | Failure to deduct/remit | 10% of unremitted amount + interest at CBN MPR + 5% | CITA Section 81 / PITA Section 73 |

### 7.5 Filing-versus-payment ordering

Unlike some jurisdictions, in Nigerian practice the assessment is generated FROM the filed return, then the Remita RRR is settled. There is no true "pay first, then file" — but for the return to be treated as substantively complete, the matching payment must be made before the deadline. Late payment penalties accrue independently of late filing penalties.

## Section 13 — 2026 planning notes (NTA 2025 transitional impact)

The capstone produces a forward-looking section so the taxpayer arrives at the next year's filing aware of the structural changes the **Nigeria Tax Act 2025** introduces.

### 13.1 NTA 2025 — what changes from 1 January 2026

| Area | FY 2025 (current) | FY 2026 (NTA 2025) | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| CIT large-company rate | 30% | **25%** | Re-forecast tax in 2026 budget |
| Small company threshold | Turnover ≤ ₦25M | **Turnover ≤ ₦100M** | Many medium companies move into small-company exemption (0% CIT) |
| TET + NITDA + NASENI | 3% + 1% + 0.25% separate levies | Consolidated **Development Levy of 4%** | Single line in 2026 computation |
| Minimum tax (companies) | Section 33 CITA: 0.5% turnover | **MEFR 15%** for MNE groups ≥ €750M consolidated revenue (Pillar Two) | Pillar Two diagnostic for MNE clients |
| PIT structure | Graduated 7–24%, CRA, Sixth Schedule reliefs | New brackets 0–25%; ₦800K tax-free threshold; rent relief ₦200K | Update payroll PAYE calculations from 1 Jan 2026 |
| TIN | Separate FIRS TIN (companies) and JTB TIN (individuals) | **Unified TIN** — single identifier | Re-validate identifiers post 1 Jan 2026 |
| Tax authority | FIRS | **Nigeria Revenue Service (NRS)** | Portal rebrand; processes substantively unchanged in short term |
| VAT rate | 7.5% | **7.5%** (unchanged — proposed increase dropped) | No change |
| Digital services | Significant Economic Presence rules (FA 2019) | NTA 2025 codifies + expands; includes non-resident e-commerce | If MNE: review SEP exposure |
| Consolidated view | Separate modules in Tax Pro-Max | **Nigeria Tax Account** consolidates all obligations in one ledger from 1 Jan 2026 | Reconciliation should be easier post-rollout |

### 13.2 Provisional / advance tax for 2026

- **CIT:** Plan provisional CIT under CITA Section 77 if the company will pay in instalments; first instalment due with provisional return (typically within 3 months of FY-end). Provisional return is filed on the basis of current-year forecast.
- **PIT:** Self-employed individuals pay provisional PIT in 4 quarterly instalments under PITA Section 44 (15 April, 15 July, 15 October, 15 January). Compute on best estimate of FY 2026 chargeable income at NEW NTA 2025 rates.

### 13.3 Compliance certificate renewals

All four compliance certificates (ITF, NSITF, PenCom, NHF) renew annually. Plan applications **early Q1 2026** to ensure TCC is not blocked. Each can take 2–6 weeks.

### 13.4 Transfer pricing (companies)

If related-party transactions exist:
- **Local File:** Required for entities with related-party transactions ≥ ₦300M (FIRS TP Regulations 2018 Regulation 16). Due with CIT return (30 June 2026 for 31 Dec 2025 FYE).
- **Master File:** Required for entities part of MNE groups ≥ ₦160B consolidated revenue. Same due date.
- **CbCR Notification:** Annual within 12 months of FY-end if MNE.
- **TP Declaration Form:** Submitted as schedule to Tax Pro-Max return.

### 13.5 Minimum tax monitoring

Under CITA Section 33, where a company has insufficient tax payable (e.g., due to large capital allowances or losses), minimum tax of **0.5% of gross turnover** applies (excluded: small companies under Section 40, companies in first 4 years of operation, manufacturing within first 4 years, agricultural). Flag in 2026 forecast if minimum tax is likely to bite.

### 13.6 Excess Dividend Tax (EDT)

Under CITA Section 19, if a company pays dividends in excess of its taxable profits for the year, the excess is taxable at the corporate rate. Plan dividend distributions to avoid EDT exposure. Finance Act 2020 narrowed but did not eliminate EDT.

## Section 14 — Conservative defaults

When inputs from upstream skills are ambiguous or missing, apply the following defaults and flag for the reviewer:

| Situation | Conservative default |
|---|---|
| Cross-skill reconciliation differs by > ₦1,000 | Flag as "Needs Input"; do not silently round |
| Tax Pro-Max billing reference / Remita RRR unknown | Use "TBC — generate via Tax Pro-Max" and DO NOT estimate the RRR |
| Company size classification borderline (turnover near ₦25M / ₦100M boundary) | Use HIGHER tax bracket as conservative; flag for reviewer |
| State of residence ambiguous (multi-state employee) | Default to state of principal employment per PITA First Schedule; flag |
| Capital allowances cap applicability unclear (non-manufacturing vs manufacturing) | Apply 66 2/3% cap; flag for reviewer |
| TIN missing or unverified | Cannot finalise return; flag as blocker |
| WHT credit notes claimed but not in hand | Exclude the credit; flag for taxpayer to obtain |
| Audit requirement unclear (small company exempted from audit by CAMA 2020 Section 402 — must be a small company per CAMA definition) | Recommend audit unless clearly exempt; conservative position |
| Donation deductibility uncertain (recipient not on CITA Sixth Schedule) | Disallow; flag for reviewer |
| December payroll true-up not booked | Treat year as incomplete; cannot finalise return until December payroll closed |
| Foreign tax credit certificate of payment missing | Disallow credit; flag for documentation |
| Related-party transactions undocumented | Flag transfer pricing risk; do not assume arm's-length |
| Compliance certificate missing or expired | Flag as TCC blocker |
| NTA 2025 rate or threshold assumed for FY 2025 | Reject; FY 2025 uses pre-NTA rules; NTA 2025 applies from 1 Jan 2026 only |

## Section 15 — Refusals

**R-NG-ASM-1 — Upstream skill did not run.** Name the missing skill. Continue with available data; flag the gap; do not fabricate the missing computation.

**R-NG-ASM-2 — Upstream self-check failed.** Note the specific check; continue but flag.

## Section 17 — Reviewer attestation block

The final working paper carries an attestation block the credentialed reviewer signs:

```markdown
# Reviewer Attestation — Year of Assessment 2026 (FY 2025)

I, [Name], [ICAN/ANAN] member with ICAN/ANAN number [____], 
and [CITN member where applicable] number [____],

```

**No filing without this signed attestation.**

## Section 18 — Output files

The final output is **three files**:

1. **`[taxpayer_slug]_2025_ng_master.xlsx`** — Master workbook. Sheets: Cover, Identity, Form A (or CIT Self-Assessment), Tax Computation, Capital Allowances, Loss Relief, WHT Credit Notes Register, Statutory Deductions Register, VAT Reconciliation, Form H1 / Form G Reconciliation, Cross-Check Summary, Tax Pro-Max / Remita Payment Schedule, Compliance Certificates Tracker. Use live formulas where possible; verify no `#REF!` errors.

2. **`reviewer_brief.md`** — Markdown file with all Section 8 contents, plus the headline blocks from Section 9 and the attestation block from Section 17.

3. **`taxpayer_action_list.md`** — Markdown file with all Section 12 contents, plus the payment instructions block from Section 10 and filing instructions block from Section 11.

All three files are placed in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` and presented to the user at the end.

If execution runs out of context mid-build, complete the computation work first and produce whichever formatted outputs are finished, then state clearly which deliverables are partial.

## Section 19 — Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated; the reviewer or taxpayer enters values into Tax Pro-Max / State IRS portals using the working paper.
2. Tax Pro-Max XML / bulk upload templates are not generated by this skill; integrations with ERP / accounting software handle that.
3. Audited financial statements attachment is the taxpayer's responsibility; this skill only flags when audit is required (CAMA 2020 Section 402 small-company exemption).
4. Transfer pricing local file / master file content is referenced but not assembled here (separate skill needed for full TP documentation).
5. Petroleum Profits Tax / Hydrocarbon Tax under PIA 2021 is out of scope.
6. Pioneer status (NIPC) / freezone (NEPZA / OGFZA) regime computations are out of scope.
7. Country-by-Country Reporting XML is not assembled here.
8. NTA 2025 implementing regulations may evolve through 2025–2026; every prospective rule in this skill should be re-verified against the gazetted NTA 2025 commencement notice and any FIRS / NRS implementation guidance.
9. State IRS portal mechanics vary by state; this skill describes the LIRS pattern as the most-developed example. Smaller states may require paper filings; flag in intake.
10. CGT on shares: NTA 2025 changes the CGT treatment of certain share disposals from 1 Jan 2026 — not relevant for 2025 returns but flagged in planning.

### Change log
- **v1.0 (May 2026):** Initial release. Modelled on mt-return-assembly, us-ca-return-assembly, and id-return-assembly. Adapted for Nigerian PIT Form A, CIT Self-Assessment via FIRS Tax Pro-Max, State IRS coordination, Remita / TSA payment, and NTA 2025 transitional impact. Coordinates nine upstream Nigeria skills.
