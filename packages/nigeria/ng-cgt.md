## Section 2 — Required inputs & refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

Before computing any Nigerian CGT position, obtain:

1. **Identity & residency** — taxpayer name, TIN, residency status (resident individual, resident company, non-resident).
2. **Asset description** — class (real property, shares, business asset, intangible, other chattel).
3. **Acquisition data** — acquisition date, acquisition cost (with documentary support), incidental costs of acquisition.
4. **Disposal data** — disposal date, disposal proceeds, incidental costs of disposal (legal fees, commissions, transfer duties).
5. **Connection** — whether the parties are connected persons (market value rule applies under CGTA s. 19).
6. **For shares** — aggregate proceeds from share disposals in the same 12-month window across the taxpayer's portfolio; reinvestment in other Nigerian company shares within the same tax year.
7. **For business assets** — whether replacement asset has been acquired (or will be) within the rollover window.
8. **Prior-year losses** — CGT losses brought forward (capital losses ring-fenced from income).

### Refusal catalogue

STOP and do not produce a final CGT figure where any of the following applies:

| Trigger | Reason |
|---|---|
| Acquisition cost is unknown or undocumented | Cannot compute chargeable gain; do not use estimates without explicit reviewer sign-off |
| Asset acquired by gift / inheritance with no probate valuation | Need market-value documentation for base cost |
| Cross-border disposal where double-tax-treaty relief may apply | Requires bilateral treaty analysis — out of scope of this skill |
| Disposal of partnership interests | Treatment uncertain under CGTA; refer to FIRS guidance |
| Mineral rights / oil-block disposals | Petroleum Industry Act overlay — out of scope |
| Trust / estate disposals | Specialist trust-CGT regime — out of scope |
| Disposal occurring after NTA 2025 commencement where final implementing regulations are not yet published | Conservative default: compute under CGTA framework, flag for review once NTA regulations issued |
| Insufficient evidence that the ₦100M share threshold has been correctly aggregated across the taxpayer's full portfolio | Cannot confirm exemption eligibility |

## Section 3 — Tier 1 — chargeable persons, chargeable assets, computation

### 3.1 Chargeable persons (CGTA s. 2)

CGT is charged on the chargeable gains accruing to:

- A **resident individual** — on worldwide chargeable assets, subject to remittance basis for non-Nigerian-situs assets where gains are not brought into Nigeria.
- A **resident company** — on worldwide chargeable assets.
- A **non-resident person** — on chargeable assets situated in Nigeria (Nigerian land, Nigerian-incorporated company shares, business assets used in a Nigerian trade or branch).

### 3.2 Chargeable assets (CGTA s. 3)

All forms of property are chargeable assets, including:

- Land and buildings (whether in Nigeria or abroad, for residents).
- Shares and stocks of any company, subject to the Finance Act 2021 ₦100M threshold (see §4).
- Goodwill and other intangible business assets.
- Options, debts, and incorporeal property generally.
- Currency other than Nigerian currency.
- Any form of property created by the person disposing of it.

### 3.3 Computation formula

Chargeable gain = Disposal proceeds − Allowable acquisition cost − Incidental costs of acquisition − Incidental costs of disposal − Enhancement expenditure (capital improvements only)

CGT payable = Chargeable gain × 10%

### 3.4 Allowable deductions (CGTA s. 13)

- Original acquisition cost.
- Incidental costs of acquisition (legal fees, stamp duty, survey, commission).
- Enhancement expenditure reflected in the state of the asset at disposal — **routine repairs and revenue expenditure are NOT allowable**.
- Incidental costs of disposal (legal fees, agent's commission, advertising).
- Costs of establishing, preserving, or defending title to the asset.

### 3.5 Connected persons rule (CGTA s. 19)

Where the disposal is between connected persons (relatives, controlling shareholders, group companies), the transaction is deemed to be at **market value**, regardless of the stated consideration. This prevents undervaluation between related parties.

### 3.6 Capital losses (CGTA s. 5)

- Capital losses are **ring-fenced** — they may only be set against capital gains, not against income.
- Losses may be carried forward indefinitely against future capital gains of the same person.
- Losses on disposals to connected persons are restricted to gains on subsequent disposals to the same connected person.

## Section 4 — Tier 2 — exemptions, rollover relief, NTA 2025 changes

### 4.1 Statutory exemptions (CGTA ss. 26-43)

The following are exempt from CGT:

| Exemption | Authority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Principal private residence | CGTA s. 36 | Sole or main dwelling, subject to area limit |
| Personal chattels disposed of for ≤ ₦1,000 | CGTA s. 37 | Small disposal exemption |
| Motor vehicles (private passenger cars) | CGTA s. 38 | Not commercial vehicles |
| Gifts to charity / educational / ecclesiastical bodies | CGTA s. 30 | Recipient must be registered |
| Life assurance policy proceeds | CGTA s. 33 | To original policyholder |
| Stocks & bonds — Federal Government, State Government, LGA, statutory corporation securities | CGTA s. 30 | Sovereign and parastatal debt exempt |
| Transfers between spouses | CGTA s. 36 | No-gain-no-loss treatment |
| Compensation for personal injury | CGTA s. 35 | Restricted to genuine injury awards |
| Diplomatic missions | CGTA s. 39 | Reciprocal basis |

### 4.2 Shares — the ₦100M threshold (Finance Act 2021)

Before the Finance Act 2021, gains on disposals of shares (especially listed shares) were broadly exempt. The Finance Act 2021 introduced a **threshold rule**:

- Share disposals where the **aggregate proceeds across all share disposals by the taxpayer in any 12-month period do not exceed ₦100 million** remain exempt.
- Where aggregate proceeds exceed ₦100 million in any 12-month period, the **portion above ₦100M** is brought into charge at 10%, unless the proceeds are reinvested in the shares of any Nigerian company within the same tax year.
- The reinvestment relief is asset-class specific — reinvestment must be in Nigerian company shares, not in other asset classes.
- The taxpayer must aggregate disposals across all brokers, accounts, and NGX-listed and unlisted companies.

**Worked aggregation rule:** Compute total share-disposal proceeds in the rolling 12-month window. Deduct ₦100M. If the residual is positive AND not reinvested in Nigerian shares within the tax year, the chargeable gain attributable to that residual portion is taxable at 10%.

### 4.3 Rollover relief — replacement of business assets (CGTA s. 32)

Where a person disposes of a business asset and acquires a replacement business asset within **12 months before or after** the disposal, the gain on the old asset may be deferred (rolled over) into the base cost of the new asset.

Qualifying classes of business assets include:

- Land and buildings occupied and used for the trade.
- Fixed plant and machinery.
- Ships, aircraft, hovercraft.
- Goodwill.

The classes must match — e.g. land replaced with land, plant with plant. Mixed-class rollover requires FIRS confirmation.

Where only part of the proceeds is reinvested, partial rollover applies and the un-reinvested portion is immediately chargeable.

### 4.4 NTA 2025 — consolidation of CGT into the income tax framework

The **Nigeria Tax Act (NTA) 2025**, part of the suite of fiscal reforms enacted in 2025, consolidates Capital Gains Tax into the general income tax framework. Pre-2025 CGTA provisions remain operative for disposals during transitional periods, but for periods on or after the NTA commencement date:

- CGT is administered alongside Companies Income Tax (CIT) and Personal Income Tax (PIT) under a unified return.
- The 10% headline rate is retained for most asset classes (subject to confirmation in implementing regulations).
- Treatment of share disposals, the ₦100M threshold, rollover relief, and exemptions is being re-codified — **implementing regulations are pending as of the 2025 tax year**.
- **Conservative default:** until FIRS publishes the implementing regulations, prepare CGT computations under the pre-NTA CGTA framework and flag the position for review once the regulations are finalised.

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### Example A — Sale of investment property (resident individual)

**Facts.** Mr Adewale, a Lagos-resident individual, sold a commercial property in Ikeja on 15 June 2025. The property was acquired in 2018.

| Line item | Amount (₦) |
|---|---|
| Disposal proceeds | 250,000,000 |
| Less: Incidental costs of disposal (legal 1.5%, agent 5%) | (16,250,000) |
| Net proceeds | 233,750,000 |
| Less: Acquisition cost (2018) | (120,000,000) |
| Less: Incidental costs of acquisition (stamp duty, legal) | (6,000,000) |
| Less: Enhancement expenditure (extension, 2021) | (25,000,000) |
| **Chargeable gain** | **82,750,000** |
| CGT at 10% | **8,275,000** |

The CGT of ₦8,275,000 is reported alongside Mr Adewale's PIT return for 2025 to the Lagos State Internal Revenue Service. Routine repairs incurred over the holding period are NOT deductible.

### Example B — Sale of company shares (resident individual)

**Facts.** Mrs Okonkwo disposed of equity holdings during 2025 as follows:

| Disposal | Date | Proceeds (₦) | Cost (₦) |
|---|---|---|---|
| NGX-listed Co. A shares | March 2025 | 60,000,000 | 25,000,000 |
| NGX-listed Co. B shares | August 2025 | 85,000,000 | 40,000,000 |
| Unlisted Co. C shares | November 2025 | 40,000,000 | 30,000,000 |
| **Aggregate proceeds (12-month window)** | | **185,000,000** | |

Aggregate share-disposal proceeds in 2025 exceed ₦100M. The portion above the threshold is ₦85,000,000.

Mrs Okonkwo did **not** reinvest in any Nigerian company shares during 2025. The taxable portion of the gain is computed by apportioning the total chargeable gain to the residual proceeds above the threshold:

| Line item | Amount (₦) |
|---|---|
| Total proceeds | 185,000,000 |
| Total cost basis | 95,000,000 |
| Total chargeable gain | 90,000,000 |
| Apportioned to residual above ₦100M (85,000,000 / 185,000,000 × 90,000,000) | 41,351,351 |
| CGT at 10% | **4,135,135** |

The CGT is reported with the 2025 PIT return. If Mrs Okonkwo had reinvested ≥ ₦85M into Nigerian shares within 2025, the residual gain would be exempt.

## Section 6 — Filing & payment

### 6.1 Resident individuals (PIT)

- CGT computation is appended to the annual **Personal Income Tax (PIT) return** filed with the relevant **State Internal Revenue Service (SIRS)** in the taxpayer's state of residence.
- Filing deadline: **31 March** following the end of the tax year (calendar-year basis), per Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) s. 41.
- Payment: due on filing.

### 6.2 Resident companies (CIT)

- CGT computation is appended to the annual **Companies Income Tax (CIT) return** filed with **FIRS**.
- Filing deadline: **6 months after** the end of the company's accounting year (Companies Income Tax Act s. 55).
- Payment: due on filing; companies in their first 18 months may use the self-assessment provisions.

### 6.3 Non-residents

- 10% CGT applies on chargeable gains from Nigerian-situs assets (Nigerian land, Nigerian-incorporated company shares, Nigerian business assets).
- For non-resident disposals of Nigerian real property or shares, the **buyer / Nigerian payment agent may be required to withhold** CGT and remit to FIRS. Confirm in each case whether withholding is mandated by current FIRS Information Circular.
- Non-resident sellers should obtain a **Tax Clearance Certificate (TCC)** confirming CGT has been settled before perfecting title transfer.

### 6.4 Records & retention

- Retain acquisition contracts, valuation evidence, brokerage notes, and disposal contracts for **6 years** from the end of the relevant tax year (general FIRS / SIRS retention rule).
- Where rollover relief is claimed, retain documentation of the replacement asset acquisition for the life of the replacement asset plus 6 years.

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown acquisition cost | STOP — cannot compute gain |
| Acquisition by gift or inheritance with no valuation | Obtain probate / market valuation; if unavailable, STOP |
| Unknown whether the ₦100M share threshold is breached in aggregate | Assume breached → compute at 10% conservatively, refund position later if portfolio aggregation confirms exemption |
| Unknown whether reinvestment in Nigerian shares occurred within the tax year | Assume no reinvestment → tax the residual |
| Unknown whether parties are connected | Treat as connected → apply market value rule |
| Routine repair vs enhancement expenditure ambiguous | Treat as routine repair → NOT deductible |
| Disposal post NTA 2025 commencement, regulations pending | Compute under CGTA framework; flag for review under NTA implementing regulations |
| Cross-border disposal with possible treaty relief | STOP — refer to specialist treaty review |
| PPR claimed but property was let or had non-residential use | Restrict PPR proportionally; conservative default → no PPR |
| Non-resident disposal where withholding obligation unclear | Assume withholding applies; remit 10% to FIRS pending clarification |
