# Nigeria — Pay-As-You-Earn (PAYE) — Skill v1.0

> **2025/2026 changes summary (v1.0):** PAYE continues to be administered under the **Personal Income Tax Act (PITA) Cap. P8 LFN 2004 (as amended by the Finance Acts 2011–2023)** for the 2025 tax year. The **Nigeria Tax Act 2025 (NTA 2025)**, signed 26 June 2025, takes effect **1 January 2026** and replaces PITA — but **the 2025 PAYE year is still computed under PITA**. From 1 January 2026, PAYE will run on the new NTA 2025 bracket structure and consolidated relief regime, and remittance is expected to migrate to a single payroll module integrated with the **FIRS TaxPro-Max** portal (implementation date TBC per FIRS circulars). PAYE is collected by the **State Internal Revenue Service (SIRS)** of the employee's state of residence; for employees resident in the **Federal Capital Territory (FCT)**, for **non-resident employers without a Nigerian fixed base**, and for **federal Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs)**, PAYE is remitted to **FIRS** instead.

## Section 2 — Required inputs & refusal catalogue

### Required inputs (per pay period)

For each employee on the payroll:

1. **Identity**: Full name, JTB-issued TIN, NIN, date of joining (if mid-year), state of residence.
2. **Gross emoluments** for the month: basic salary, housing, transport, utility, leave, meal, entertainment, productivity, and all cash allowances.
3. **Benefits in kind (BIK)**: official car, accommodation provided, asset use — valued per PITA s.4 and Sixth Schedule.
4. **Statutory deductions evidence**:
   - Pension contribution (employee 8% under PRA 2014 s.4)
   - National Housing Fund (NHF) 2.5% — only if employee earns ≥ ₦3,000/month under the NHF Act 1992
   - National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) employee share (if scheme participates)
   - Life assurance premium (must be on the employee's own life; receipts required)
   - Gratuity contribution (where applicable)
5. **Variable items**: bonuses, commissions, overtime, leave allowance, 13th-month, gratuity payments, severance.
6. **Marital and dependent status** — *for 2026 onward under NTA 2025 only*; PITA 2025 uses Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA), not dependent-based reliefs.
7. **Employer details**: TIN, RC number, state of operation, payroll registration with the relevant SIRS / FIRS.

## Section 3 — Tier 1: Monthly PAYE computation mechanics

> **Bracket table & CRA formula:** This skill assumes the PITA 2025 bracket table, the Consolidated Relief Allowance formula `CRA = higher of ₦200,000 or 1% of gross income, plus 20% of gross income`, and the pension/NHF/NHIA/life-assurance deduction list — all of which live in the **`ng-income-tax`** skill. Always load `ng-income-tax` alongside this skill. This section focuses on the **payroll mechanics**: how those numbers flow through a monthly schedule.

### Step-by-step monthly computation (PITA 2025)

```
Step 1:  Annualise the period gross
         Annualised gross = Monthly gross × 12   (or actual YTD ÷ months × 12)

Step 2:  Compute statutory deductions (annualised)
         − Pension employee share (8% of basic + housing + transport)  [PRA 2014 s.4(1)]
         − NHF (2.5% of monthly basic, if salary ≥ ₦3,000)              [NHF Act 1992]
         − NHIA employee share (where scheme applies)
         − Life assurance premium (on own life; receipts required)
         − Gratuity contribution (where applicable)

Step 3:  Compute Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)
         CRA = (1% × annualised gross, floor ₦200,000) + (20% × annualised gross)

Step 4:  Chargeable Income (annualised)
         = Annualised gross
           − Pension − NHF − NHIA − Life assurance − Gratuity
           − CRA

Step 5:  Apply the PITA progressive brackets (see ng-income-tax) to chargeable income
         → Annual PAYE liability

Step 6:  Monthly PAYE deduction
         = Annual PAYE ÷ 12

Step 7:  Net pay
         = Monthly gross − Monthly PAYE − Monthly pension − Monthly NHF − Monthly NHIA
           − any other voluntary deductions
```

### Important mechanics notes

- **Annualisation is mandatory**: PAYE is computed on an annual basis and prorated monthly, even for monthly payroll. Do **not** apply brackets directly to a monthly figure.
- **Minimum tax**: where chargeable income is zero or negative, the **1% minimum tax on gross income** under PITA s.37 still applies for 2025. NTA 2025 from 2026 onward **abolishes** the minimum tax for individuals earning below the new exemption threshold.
- **Basis of pension**: The 8% pension base is **basic + housing + transport** (BHT) under PRA 2014 s.4(3) — **not** total emoluments. Many payrolls get this wrong.
- **BIK**: Use the prescribed valuation in PITA Sixth Schedule (e.g. official residential accommodation = 5% of annual basic salary; official car for private use = 5% of cost). Add to gross before CRA.
- **Mid-year joiners**: Annualise from joining date. Use **months remaining in the year** as the divisor, not 12. Re-cut at year-end via Form H1.
- **Mid-year leavers**: Issue a **Termination Certificate (TCC pre-cursor)** showing YTD emoluments and PAYE; new employer continues from that point.
- **State of residence rule**: PAYE is paid to the SIRS of the state where the employee **resides** (not where the office is). For employees who change residence mid-year, prorate between SIRSs based on months of residence.

---

## Section 4 — Tier 2: Bonuses, gratuity, severance, expatriate secondment

### 4.1 Bonuses and 13th-month pay

- **PITA 2025 treatment**: Bonuses are **part of gross emoluments** in the month paid. Annualise the YTD total (including the bonus) and recompute PAYE; the variance flows to the bonus-month payroll.
- **Practical approach**: Use the **cumulative method** — at each pay run, recompute YTD PAYE on YTD emoluments, subtract YTD PAYE already deducted, deduct the balance this month. This avoids end-of-year shocks for irregular bonuses.

### 4.2 Gratuity

- **Contributory gratuity** (employer pays into a gratuity scheme): contributions are **not taxable** in the employee's hands at the point of contribution.
- **Lump-sum gratuity on retirement**:
  - Gratuity received on **retirement** by an employee who has served ≥ **5 years** is **exempt** under PITA Third Schedule paragraph 18.
  - Gratuity on **resignation / termination** (not retirement) is **fully taxable** as part of emoluments in the year of receipt.
- **NTA 2025 (from 2026)**: retains the retirement-gratuity exemption but caps it; check NTA 2025 Sixth Schedule when filing 2026 returns.

### 4.3 Severance / terminal benefits

- **Statutory severance** under the Labour Act or a collective agreement: taxable as part of emoluments.
- **Compensation for loss of office**: First ₦10,000,000 is **exempt** under PITA Third Schedule paragraph 26; excess is taxable.
- Severance paid in instalments: tax each instalment in the year received using the cumulative annualisation method.

### 4.4 Expatriate / inbound secondment

| Scenario | PAYE treatment |
|---|---|
| Expat resident in Nigeria (≥ 183 days in 12 months OR Nigerian-domiciled employer pays salary) | **Full PAYE** on worldwide employment income from Nigerian duties |
| Expat resident < 183 days, paid by foreign employer, salary not borne by Nigerian entity | **Exempt** under PITA s.10(1)(b) (subject to DTA) |
| Expat on shadow payroll (paid offshore but Nigerian entity reimburses) | **PAYE applies** — Nigerian entity is the **economic employer**; gross-up the offshore net |
| Split contract (Nigerian + offshore) | PAYE on Nigerian-duty portion only, prorated by workdays |
| Tax-equalised expats | Compute **hypothetical home-country tax**, gross up Nigerian compensation, withhold actual Nigerian PAYE; reconcile via tax-equalisation calc at year-end |

- **Non-resident employer with no Nigerian fixed base**: PAYE remits to **FIRS** (not a SIRS). FIRS uses the Non-Resident Persons' tax office.
- **CERPAC + Expatriate Quota**: required for immigration but separate from PAYE — flag if missing during onboarding review.

### 4.5 Directors' fees

- Executive directors: PAYE in the normal way.
- Non-executive directors' fees: not "employment income" — subject to **WHT at 10%** under PITA s.69, **not PAYE**. Route to ng-wht.

## Section 5 — Worked example: monthly PAYE computation

**Scenario:** Permanent employee resident in Lagos State. Monthly basic ₦400,000, housing ₦150,000, transport ₦50,000, utility ₦20,000, meal ₦30,000. No BIK. Has TIN. Employee pension contribution at 8%, NHF participating, no NHIA, no life assurance. October 2025 payroll, no bonus.

### A — Monthly gross emoluments

| Component | Amount (₦) |
|---|---|
| Basic salary | 400,000 |
| Housing allowance | 150,000 |
| Transport allowance | 50,000 |
| Utility allowance | 20,000 |
| Meal allowance | 30,000 |
| **Monthly gross** | **650,000** |
| **Annualised gross (× 12)** | **7,800,000** |

### B — Statutory deductions (annualised)

| Component | Basis | Annual (₦) |
|---|---|---|
| Pension employee (8% of BHT) | 8% × (400,000 + 150,000 + 50,000) × 12 | 576,000 |
| NHF (2.5% of basic) | 2.5% × 400,000 × 12 | 120,000 |
| NHIA | n/a | 0 |
| Life assurance | n/a | 0 |
| Gratuity | n/a | 0 |
| **Total annual deductions** | | **696,000** |

### C — Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA)

```
CRA = max(1% × 7,800,000 ; 200,000) + (20% × 7,800,000)
    = max(78,000 ; 200,000) + 1,560,000
    = 200,000 + 1,560,000
    = ₦1,760,000
```

### D — Chargeable income

| Item | ₦ |
|---|---|
| Annualised gross | 7,800,000 |
| − Pension | (576,000) |
| − NHF | (120,000) |
| − CRA | (1,760,000) |
| **Annual chargeable income** | **5,344,000** |

### E — Annual PAYE liability

Apply the PITA progressive brackets (see `ng-income-tax` for the table). Indicative computation on ₦5,344,000 chargeable income:

| Bracket | Width | Rate | Tax (₦) |
|---|---|---|---|
| First 300,000 | 300,000 | 7% | 21,000 |
| Next 300,000 | 300,000 | 11% | 33,000 |
| Next 500,000 | 500,000 | 15% | 75,000 |
| Next 500,000 | 500,000 | 19% | 95,000 |
| Next 1,600,000 | 1,600,000 | 21% | 336,000 |
| Above 3,200,000 — first 2,144,000 of remainder | 2,144,000 | 24% | 514,560 |
| **Annual PAYE** | | | **1,074,560** |

> **Note:** Verify exact bracket numbers against `ng-income-tax`. The PITA brackets above are the long-standing 2011-Amendment brackets; NTA 2025 restructures these from 2026.

### F — Monthly PAYE

```
Monthly PAYE = 1,074,560 ÷ 12 = ₦89,547 (rounded)
```

### G — Net pay (this month)

| Component | ₦ |
|---|---|
| Monthly gross | 650,000 |
| − PAYE | (89,547) |
| − Pension employee (8% × 600,000 BHT) | (48,000) |
| − NHF (2.5% × 400,000) | (10,000) |
| **Net pay** | **502,453** |

### H — Employer cost (this month)

| Component | ₦ |
|---|---|
| Gross emoluments | 650,000 |
| Employer pension (10% × 600,000 BHT, PRA 2014 s.4(1)) | 60,000 |
| Employer NHIA (where applicable) | 0 |
| ITF (Industrial Training Fund) levy — 1% of annual payroll if ≥ 5 employees or turnover ≥ ₦50m, accrued | (separate line) |
| NSITF (Employee Compensation) — 1% of monthly payroll | 6,500 |
| **Direct employer cost** | **716,500** |

---

## Section 6 — Filing & payment

### Monthly cycle

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Run payroll; compute PAYE per Section 3 | By month-end |
| 2 | Pay net salaries | Per company policy |
| 3 | Pay employee statutory deductions (pension to PFA, NHF to FMBN, NHIA where applicable) | Per scheme rules (typically 7 days from payroll) |
| 4 | Generate **PAYE Schedule** listing each employee, TIN, gross, deductions, PAYE | Before 10th of following month |
| 5 | Pay **PAYE** to the relevant tax authority (SIRS or FIRS) via bank/online portal | **10th of following month** |
| 6 | Upload PAYE Schedule to the SIRS / FIRS portal | **10th of following month** |
| 7 | Obtain electronic receipt / acknowledgement | Same day |

### Choosing the right authority

| Employee status | Remit PAYE to |
|---|---|
| Resident of any of the 36 states | SIRS of that state (e.g. LIRS for Lagos, OYSIRS for Oyo, RIRS for Rivers, KWIRS for Kwara, etc.) |
| Resident of the Federal Capital Territory (Abuja) | **FIRS** |
| Federal MDA employees | **FIRS** |
| Employees of foreign mission / non-resident employer with no Nigerian fixed base | **FIRS** (Non-Resident Persons office) |
| Itinerant worker (works in 2+ states for ≤ 183 days each, no principal residence) | SIRS of principal place of work, per JTB rules |

### Annual cycle — Form H1

| Step | Action | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Compile annual schedule of all employees with YTD gross, deductions, PAYE remitted | December year-end |
| 2 | Reconcile 12 monthly PAYE schedules to Form H1 totals | January |
| 3 | File **Form H1 — Employer's Annual Return of All Emoluments Paid to Employees** with each relevant SIRS / FIRS | **31 January** |
| 4 | Issue each employee a **Tax Deduction Card / certificate of PAYE** for their Form A filing | By 31 January |
| 5 | Pay any year-end PAYE shortfall (or carry forward refund) | With H1 |

### Penalties

| Default | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to deduct or remit PAYE (PITA s.81 / s.82) | **10% per annum** of tax not deducted/remitted + interest at **CBN MPR + 5% p.a.** |
| Late filing of Form H1 (PITA s.94) | **₦500,000** (body corporate) / **₦50,000** (individual employer) per year of default |
| Failure to register employees for tax | **₦25,000** per employee per annum |
| Failure to deduct WHT on directors' fees / contracts | 10% of tax + interest (separate from PAYE) |

### NTA 2025 transition (from 2026)

- A unified payroll module is expected on **FIRS TaxPro-Max**, integrating PAYE with pension, NHF, NHIA, NSITF and ITF in a single monthly submission. Implementation date is TBC by FIRS circular.
- SIRSs will continue to collect PAYE under the new Joint Revenue Board framework, but data flows via the central platform.
- Until the central platform is live, **continue filing on each state's existing portal** (LIRS eTax, KWIRS, etc.).

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

When inputs are incomplete or ambiguous, default to the most cautious position and flag for reviewer:

| Situation | Conservative position |
|---|---|
| Employee TIN unknown | Assume **no TIN**; do not block payroll but flag — penalty exposure on employer if TIN not obtained within onboarding cycle |
| Employee state of residence unclear | Default to **state where the office is located** and flag for confirmation; many SIRS dispute multi-state |
| FCT vs Lagos office, employee lives in Nasarawa | Pay PAYE to **Nasarawa SIRS** (state of residence), not FCT/FIRS — verify with employee |
| BIK valuation uncertain | Use **highest reasonable valuation** in Sixth Schedule; flag for reviewer |
| Pension base unclear | Default to **basic + housing + transport** (PRA 2014 s.4(3)); do not exclude transport even where contract calls it "allowance" |
| NHF participation unknown | If employee earns ≥ ₦3,000/month, default to **deducting** NHF and flag — opting out is by employee request |
| Life assurance receipts not provided | **Do not deduct**; flag and request receipt for next month |
| Bonus month — annualisation method unclear | Use **cumulative method** (YTD recompute); avoid annualise-and-divide which under-withholds |
| Mid-year joiner with prior employer PAYE | Require **previous employer's tax deduction card**; if absent, annualise on the **assumption of no prior employment** (full CRA available) and flag for H1 true-up |
| Expat residency unclear | Default to **resident** (full PAYE) if any of: ≥ 183 days, paid by Nigerian entity, or salary recharged to Nigerian entity |
| Gratuity classification (retirement vs resignation) | Default to **resignation** (fully taxable) unless retirement at statutory retirement age is documented |
| Severance > ₦10m | Tax the **excess over ₦10m** as ordinary emoluments in the month of receipt |
| 2025 vs 2026 transition | For **2025 pay periods**: PITA. For **2026 pay periods**: NTA 2025. Do **not** apply NTA 2025 brackets to 2025 December payroll even if processed in January 2026 |
| Authority unclear (FCT vs SIRS) | Default to **FIRS** for any case with non-resident or federal nexus; flag for reviewer |
