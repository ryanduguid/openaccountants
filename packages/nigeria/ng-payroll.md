description: Use this skill whenever asked to compute, review, or advise on end-to-end Nigerian monthly payroll for employees — gross-to-net calculation, payslip generation, statutory deduction sequencing (Pension, NHF, NHIS, CRA, PAYE), employer remittance scheduling (PAYE to SIRS, Pension to PFC/PFA, NHF to FMBN, NSITF to NSITF), and year-end Form H1 reconciliation. Trigger on phrases like "Nigeria payroll", "compute Nigerian payroll", "Nigerian pay slip", "payslip Nigeria", "monthly payroll Nigeria", "payroll computation Nigeria", "PAYE and pension together", "deductions Nigeria", "gross to net Nigeria", "Lagos payroll", "LIRS payroll", "FIRS payroll", "Form H1 Nigeria", "annual payroll reconciliation Nigeria", or any request involving running monthly payroll for one or more employees in Nigeria. This skill is the ORCHESTRATOR — it pulls PAYE rules from `ng-paye` and statutory employer/employee contributions (Pension, NHF, NSITF, ITF, NHIS, EDT) from `ng-statutory-deductions` and sequences them into the correct computation order. ALWAYS read this skill before touching Nigerian payroll computation.

# Nigeria — Payroll Computation (End-to-End) — Skill v1.0

> **Scope note:** This skill is the **end-to-end monthly payroll orchestrator**. It does NOT redefine PAYE brackets, CRA formulas, pension percentages, or NHF thresholds — those live in the dependency skills (`ng-paye`, `ng-statutory-deductions`). This skill defines the **sequence**, the **payslip layout**, the **remittance calendar**, and the **year-end reconciliation workflow**.
>
> **2025 changes summary (v1.0):** The Nigeria Tax Administration Act 2025 (NTA 2025), passed in Q1 2025 with phased commencement through 2026, introduces a **unified payroll module under FIRS Tax Pro-Max** intended to consolidate PAYE filings for federal MDAs and (subject to MoU) state Internal Revenue Services. As of the 2025 tax year, **state IRS portals (LIRS e-tax, FCT-IRS, OGIRS, etc.) remain the primary PAYE remittance channel** for private-sector employers. See Section 5 for the current remittance routing.

## Section 1 — Quick reference: payroll component order

The order of deductions matters because **Pension and NHF reduce the chargeable income** before PAYE is computed, while **NSITF, ITF, EDT and the employer pension share are employer costs** that do NOT affect the employee's PAYE base.

| Step | Component | Effect on employee PAYE base | Paid by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Gross monthly emolument** (basic + housing + transport + other taxable allowances + BIK) | Starting point | — |
| 2 | − Employee Pension contribution (8% of BHT, see `ng-statutory-deductions`) | **Reduces** PAYE base | Employee |
| 3 | − Employee NHF contribution (2.5% of basic, if applicable) | **Reduces** PAYE base | Employee |
| 4 | − Employee NHIS contribution (if scheme operated; varies) | **Reduces** PAYE base | Employee |
| 5 | = Gross income for CRA purposes | — | — |
| 6 | − Consolidated Relief Allowance (CRA) — `max(NGN 200,000, 1% × gross) + 20% × gross` | **Reduces** PAYE base | — |
| 7 | = Chargeable income | — | — |
| 8 | Apply PITA Sixth Schedule progressive brackets (see `ng-paye`) | → PAYE liability | — |
| 9 | = **PAYE for the month** | — | Employee (withheld) |
| 10 | Net pay = Gross − Employee Pension − Employee NHF − Employee NHIS − PAYE − any voluntary deductions | — | — |

**Employer-side costs (parallel, do NOT affect employee net):**

| Component | Rate / amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Employer Pension | 10% of BHT | Remitted to employee's PFA via PFC |
| NSITF (ECS) | 1% of total payroll | Employer-only |
| ITF | 1% of total payroll (employers with ≥ 5 staff OR turnover ≥ NGN 50m) | Annual return |
| EDT (Tertiary Education Tax) | Not employer payroll cost — corporate tax on assessable profits |
| NHIS employer share | If group scheme operated; varies |

> **Conservative default:** When in doubt whether a deduction reduces the PAYE base, treat it as **non-deductible** (i.e. PAYE is computed on the higher figure) and flag for reviewer. Over-withholding can be refunded via year-end reconciliation; under-withholding triggers SIRS penalties and interest.

## Section 2 — Required inputs & refusal catalogue

### 2.1 Inputs required to run a payroll

For each employee, the following must be confirmed before computation:

| Input | Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TIN (Tax Identification Number) | Employee record / JTB | Required for PAYE filing; flag if missing |
| State of tax residence | Employee record | Determines which SIRS receives PAYE (per PITA §2(2)) |
| Gross monthly emolument breakdown | Contract / HR | Must split Basic / Housing / Transport / Other |
| Pension scheme status | RSA + PFA details | Confirm employee has RSA opened |
| NHF applicability | Salary ≥ NGN 3,000/month and Nigerian citizen | See `ng-statutory-deductions` |
| NHIS scheme details | If operated by employer | Optional except for federal MDAs |
| Marital / dependent status | Not relevant for CRA (Nigeria abolished personal/children allowances in 2020) | Retained only for HR records |
| Benefits in Kind (BIK) for the month | HR / accounts payable | Must be quantified before PAYE |

### 2.2 Refusal catalogue — out of scope for this skill

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Cross-border employment (employee tax-resident outside Nigeria, employer in Nigeria) | Refer to a qualified Nigerian tax consultant — treaty analysis required |
| Expatriates with split-pay arrangements (home-country + Nigeria) | Out of scope; refer to specialist |
| Directors' fees not paid through payroll | Out of scope — covered by WHT under `ng-paye` |
| Employee stock options / share-based payments | Out of scope — bespoke valuation and CGT interaction |
| Salary sacrifice into pension above 8% statutory | Permitted under PRA 2014 §11(7) but flag for reviewer — quantum and PAYE-deductibility need confirmation |
| Termination payments / gratuity > NGN 10m | Flag — exemption thresholds and tax treatment require legal review |
| Backdated salary adjustments spanning > 1 tax year | Refer to specialist — re-opening of prior-year H1 may be required |

---

## Section 3 — Step-by-step payroll computation

The procedure below is the **canonical monthly run**. Apply per employee.

### Step 1 — Build the gross emolument

```
Basic salary                          B
+ Housing allowance                   H
+ Transport allowance                 T
+ Other taxable allowances            O   (utility, meal, leave, entertainment, etc.)
+ Cash bonus paid in month            X
+ Benefits in Kind (BIK)              K
= Gross monthly emolument             G = B + H + T + O + X + K
```

**Note on BHT:** Pension contributions are computed on **Basic + Housing + Transport** (BHT), not on G. See `ng-statutory-deductions` for the legislative basis (PRA 2014 §4(3)).

### Step 2 — Compute statutory deductions that reduce PAYE base

| Deduction | Formula | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Employee Pension | 8% × (B + H + T) | Per PRA 2014 |
| Employee NHF | 2.5% × B | Only if Nigerian citizen AND monthly basic ≥ NGN 3,000 |
| Employee NHIS | Per scheme rules (commonly 1.75% × B for federal MDAs) | Skip if no scheme |

Call these collectively `D_pre`.

### Step 3 — Compute CRA gross income and CRA

```
Gross_for_CRA = G − D_pre
CRA = max(NGN 200,000 annual / NGN 16,666.67 monthly, 1% × Gross_for_CRA) + 20% × Gross_for_CRA
```

**Monthly application:** Divide annual CRA components by 12, OR — recommended approach — compute on annualized gross and divide the result by 12. The annualized approach is more accurate when income varies month-to-month and matches the year-end reconciliation. See `ng-paye` for the canonical formula.

### Step 4 — Chargeable income

```
Chargeable_monthly = Gross_for_CRA − CRA_monthly
```

### Step 5 — Apply PITA Sixth Schedule progressive brackets

Annualize `Chargeable_monthly × 12`, apply the brackets from `ng-paye`, divide the result by 12 to get **monthly PAYE**. The annualized method avoids the regressive distortion that occurs when applying brackets directly to monthly income.

### Step 6 — Minimum tax check

If the computed PAYE is less than **1% of gross income** (minimum tax under PITA §37, see `ng-paye`), substitute the minimum tax. Common for low earners; rare for the salary range typically processed via formal payroll.

### Step 7 — Net pay

```
Net pay = G − Employee Pension − Employee NHF − Employee NHIS − PAYE − Voluntary deductions (loan repayments, salary advance recoveries, union dues, etc.)
```

### Step 8 — Employer-side accruals (parallel posting)

| Item | Posted to |
|---|---|
| Employer Pension 10% × BHT | DR Payroll expense, CR Pension payable |
| NSITF 1% × total payroll | DR Payroll expense, CR NSITF payable |
| ITF 1% × total payroll (qualifying employers) | DR Payroll expense, CR ITF payable (accrued monthly, paid annually) |

## Section 4 — Payslip components & sample

A **conforming Nigerian payslip** must show, at minimum:

1. Employer name, address, employer TIN
2. Employee name, employee TIN, RSA PIN, state of tax residence
3. Pay period and pay date
4. Gross emolument breakdown (basic, housing, transport, other allowances, BIK)
5. Statutory deductions, **itemized** (Pension, NHF, NHIS, PAYE)
6. Voluntary deductions
7. Net pay
8. Employer contributions (for transparency — Pension 10%, NSITF, ITF)
9. YTD totals (cumulative gross, cumulative PAYE, cumulative pension)

### Sample payslip — Lagos employee, NGN 500,000 gross monthly

## Section 5 — Monthly remittance calendar

| Item | Recipient | Deadline | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PAYE** | Relevant State IRS (state of employee's tax residence) | **10th of the following month** | LIRS e-tax (Lagos); FCT-IRS portal (FCT); other state IRS portals or bank Pay-Direct |
| **Employee + Employer Pension** | Pension Fund Custodian (PFC) for credit to employee's PFA | **Within 7 working days** of salary payment date | PFA transfer via PFC; PenCom RSA Multifund schedule |
| **NHF** | Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) | **Within 1 month** of deduction | FMBN-designated commercial banks |
| **NSITF (ECS)** | Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund | **Monthly, by the last day of the following month** | NSITF e-portal / designated banks |
| **NHIS (if operated)** | NHIS / HMO | Per scheme rules — typically monthly | HMO direct |
| **ITF (employer only)** | Industrial Training Fund | **Annual** — by 1 April of following year | ITF portal |

### NTA 2025 unified module (status note)

The NTA 2025 unified payroll module under **FIRS Tax Pro-Max** is being rolled out in phases:

- **Phase 1 (2025):** Federal MDAs migrate from IPPIS-only PAYE flows to Tax Pro-Max integration. Private-sector employers are NOT required to switch.
- **Phase 2 (TBC, expected 2026):** State IRS integration via MoU. **Until the relevant state IRS publishes its onboarding notice, continue using the existing state portal (LIRS e-tax, etc.).**
- **Conservative default:** Continue with current state IRS portals; track NTA 2025 commencement notices monthly.

### Late-payment penalties (summary — full detail in `ng-paye` and `ng-statutory-deductions`)

| Item | Penalty |
|---|---|
| PAYE late remittance | 10% of unremitted tax + interest at CBN MPR + 5% (PITA §82) |
| Pension late remittance | 2% per month of unremitted amount (PRA 2014 §11(7)) |
| NHF late remittance | NGN 50,000 (individual) / NGN 100,000 (body corporate) + recovery |
| NSITF late remittance | 10% of contribution + interest |

---

## Section 6 — Year-end activities

### 6.1 Form H1 — Annual Employer's Return

Every employer must file **Form H1 (Annual Employer's Return of all emoluments paid to employees)** with the relevant State IRS by **31 January** of the following year, covering the preceding tax year (1 January – 31 December).

| Field | Content |
|---|---|
| Employer details | Name, TIN, address |
| Schedule of employees | Name, TIN, RSA PIN, total gross emolument, total reliefs (CRA, pension, NHF, NHIS), chargeable income, total PAYE remitted by month |
| Reconciliation | Sum of monthly PAYE remitted must equal computed annual PAYE per employee |
| Variance | Any under-remittance is payable; over-remittance is offsetable against the next year (refund procedurally difficult) |

### 6.2 Employee tax deduction certificate (informal "P9A/P9B equivalent")

Nigeria has no single statutory equivalent of the Kenyan P9A/P9B form, but employers customarily issue an **"Employee Tax Deduction Certificate"** at year-end showing:

- Gross emolument per month and YTD
- Statutory deductions (Pension, NHF, NHIS) per month and YTD
- PAYE deducted per month and YTD
- Receipt numbers / SIRS PAYE schedule references

This certificate enables the employee to claim WHT credits, file self-assessment if they have other income sources, or substantiate income for credit/visa applications.

### 6.3 Reconciliation checklist

| Check | Pass criterion |
|---|---|
| Sum of monthly Form A (PAYE schedule) = Form H1 total | ✓ |
| Pension contributions remitted = 18% × annual BHT for each employee | ✓ |
| NHF contributions remitted = 2.5% × annual basic for each qualifying employee | ✓ |
| NSITF remitted = 1% × annual total payroll | ✓ |
| ITF annual return filed (if applicable) | ✓ |
| Any retroactive bonuses / 13th-month spread per `ng-paye` rules | ✓ |
| BIK valuations consistent across months | ✓ |

## Section 7 — Worked example

**Scenario:** Software developer, **Lagos resident**, NGN **500,000 gross monthly**, employed full-time at a private fintech. No BIK. Nigerian citizen. Has RSA, TIN, and is NHF-eligible. Employer operates no NHIS group scheme.

### A — Gross emolument breakdown

| Component | NGN |
|---|---|
| Basic (50% of gross) | 250,000 |
| Housing (20%) | 100,000 |
| Transport (10%) | 50,000 |
| Utility allowance | 50,000 |
| Meal allowance | 50,000 |
| **Gross monthly (G)** | **500,000** |

BHT = 250,000 + 100,000 + 50,000 = **400,000**

### B — Statutory deductions reducing PAYE base

| Item | Formula | NGN |
|---|---|---|
| Employee Pension | 8% × 400,000 | 32,000 |
| NHF | 2.5% × 250,000 | 6,250 |
| NHIS | n/a (no scheme) | 0 |
| **D_pre total** | | **38,250** |

### C — CRA computation (monthly basis using annualization)

```
Gross_for_CRA (monthly)   = 500,000 − 38,250        = 461,750
Gross_for_CRA (annualized)                          = 5,541,000

CRA (annual) = max(200,000, 1% × 5,541,000) + 20% × 5,541,000
             = max(200,000, 55,410)        + 1,108,200
             = 200,000                     + 1,108,200
             = 1,308,200

CRA (monthly) = 1,308,200 / 12 = 109,016.67
```

### D — Chargeable income

```
Chargeable_monthly  = 461,750 − 109,016.67 = 352,733.33
Chargeable_annual   = 4,232,800
```

### E — PAYE (PITA Sixth Schedule, applied annually then divided by 12)

| Bracket | Slice | Rate | Tax (annual) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 300,000 | 300,000 | 7% | 21,000 |
| 300,001 – 600,000 | 300,000 | 11% | 33,000 |
| 600,001 – 1,100,000 | 500,000 | 15% | 75,000 |
| 1,100,001 – 1,600,000 | 500,000 | 19% | 95,000 |
| 1,600,001 – 3,200,000 | 1,600,000 | 21% | 336,000 |
| 3,200,001 – 4,232,800 | 1,032,800 | 24% | 247,872 |
| **Annual PAYE** | | | **807,872** |
| **Monthly PAYE** | 807,872 / 12 | | **67,322.67** |

Minimum tax check: 1% × 500,000 = 5,000 → not binding (computed PAYE is higher).

### F — Net pay

| Item | NGN |
|---|---|
| Gross | 500,000.00 |
| − Employee Pension | (32,000.00) |
| − NHF | (6,250.00) |
| − PAYE | (67,322.67) |
| **Net pay** | **394,427.33** |

### G — Employer cost ledger (monthly)

| Item | NGN |
|---|---|
| Gross emolument | 500,000.00 |
| Employer Pension (10% × BHT) | 40,000.00 |
| NSITF (1% × Gross) | 5,000.00 |
| ITF accrual (1% × Gross) | 5,000.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | **550,000.00** |

### H — Remittances arising from this payslip

| Recipient | Amount NGN | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| LIRS (PAYE) | 67,322.67 | 10 Jun 2025 |
| PFC → PFA (Pension total) | 72,000.00 | within 7 working days of pay date |
| FMBN (NHF) | 6,250.00 | within 1 month |
| NSITF | 5,000.00 | last day of following month |
| ITF | 5,000.00 (accrued; paid annually by 1 Apr 2026) | annual |

## Section 8 — Conservative defaults

| Situation | Conservative position |
|---|---|
| Pension status unclear (RSA exists?) | Assume RSA exists and deduct 8% / pay employer 10% — flag for HR; under-remittance triggers 2%/month penalty |
| NHF applicability unclear | If Nigerian citizen and basic ≥ NGN 3,000, deduct 2.5% — flag for reviewer if foreign national |
| BIK valuation uncertain | Use higher of cost-to-employer or open-market value — flag |
| Bonus / 13th-month timing | **Spread evenly across the 12 months of the period it relates to** for PAYE smoothing; flag if employer prefers month-paid taxation (allowed but produces a higher PAYE spike that month) |
| Multi-state employee (works across states) | Use the state where employee is **principally resident** per PITA §2(2); flag for reviewer |
| Mid-month joiner / leaver | Pro-rate gross emolument, pro-rate CRA on annualized basis, full statutory deductions on actual paid amounts |
| Employee TIN missing | Compute PAYE normally but **flag immediately** — SIRS reconciliation will reject schedule without TIN |
| Salary advance / loan recovery | Show as voluntary deduction below the line; does NOT reduce PAYE base |
| Pay in foreign currency | Convert to NGN at CBN official rate on pay date; document the rate used |
| Late hire — backdated salary | Apply current-month PAYE on full amount paid; do NOT spread retroactively without reviewer sign-off |
