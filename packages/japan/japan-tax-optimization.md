### Individual National Income Tax Brackets (2025)

| Taxable Income (JPY) | National Rate | Quick Deduction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 – 1,950,000 | 5% | ¥0 |
| 1,950,001 – 3,300,000 | 10% | ¥97,500 |
| 3,300,001 – 6,950,000 | 20% | ¥427,500 |
| 6,950,001 – 9,000,000 | 23% | ¥636,000 |
| 9,000,001 – 18,000,000 | 33% | ¥1,536,000 |
| 18,000,001 – 40,000,000 | 40% | ¥2,796,000 |
| 40,000,001+ | 45% | ¥4,796,000 |

Add residence tax (~10%) and reconstruction surtax (2.1% of income tax, through 2037).

## Section 2 — Income Splitting & Structuring

### Sole Proprietor (Kojin Jigyō) vs Corporation (KK/GK)

**Sole proprietor:** all business income taxed at progressive individual rates (up to ~55%). Simpler setup. Blue return available with ¥650,000 special deduction. NHI (国民健康保険) for health; National Pension (国民年金) for pension.

**Corporation (KK — Kabushiki Kaisha or GK — Gōdō Kaisha):** corporate tax at effective ~22–35% depending on income and capital. Director salary (yakuin hōshū) is set annually and must remain fixed. Enrolled in Shakai Hoken (厚生年金 + 健康保険) — higher benefits but split employer/employee contributions. Consumption tax exemption in first 2 fiscal years if capital ≤¥10m and prior-period revenue ≤¥10m.

**Incorporation threshold:** generally beneficial when annual profit exceeds ¥8–10 million. Below ¥5 million, sole proprietorship with blue return is usually superior due to lower compliance costs.

### Family Salary (Blue Return)

Blue-return sole proprietors can pay salaries to family members (専従者給与, senjūsha kyūyo) if:
- Family member is aged 15+ and lives with the taxpayer
- Family member works exclusively or principally in the business
- Salary is registered with the tax office in advance (届出書)
- Amount is reasonable relative to work performed

This shifts income from the higher-bracket proprietor to lower-bracket family members. White-return filers get a fixed deduction of ¥860,000 (spouse) or ¥500,000 (other family) only.

### Director Compensation (Corporation)

Director salary (定期同額給与, teiki dōgaku kyūyo) must be set at the start of the fiscal year and remain constant. Changes mid-year without valid reason are non-deductible to the corporation. Optimise by setting salary to minimise combined corporate + personal + social insurance tax.

## Section 3 — Deductions Most People Miss

| Deduction | Legislation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Blue return special deduction | Income Tax Act Art 65 | ¥650,000 if double-entry bookkeeping + e-filing or electronic ledger storage. ¥550,000 without e-filing. ¥100,000 for simplified bookkeeping |
| Medical expense deduction | Art 73 | Expenses exceeding ¥100,000 (or 5% of income if <¥2m). Family members included |
| Social insurance deduction | Art 74 | NHI premiums, National Pension, Shakai Hoken — full deduction with no cap |
| Small-scale mutual aid (Shōkibo Kyōsai) | Art 75 | Full deduction on contributions up to ¥84,000/month (¥1,008,000/year). Functions like a retirement fund for sole proprietors |
| iDeCo contributions | Art 75 | Full deduction. Self-employed: up to ¥75,000/month (combined with National Pension Fund). Employees: ¥23,000/month (or ¥62,000 combined with employer DC from Dec 2026) |
| Life insurance deduction | Art 76 | Up to ¥40,000 each for general life, medical/nursing, and individual pension = max ¥120,000 national + ¥70,000 residence tax |
| Earthquake insurance deduction | Art 77 | Up to ¥50,000 |
| Furusato Nozei (hometown tax) | Art 78, Local Tax Act | Donations to municipalities — tax credit on income + residence tax. Self-burden ¥2,000. Return gifts (up to 30% of donation value). One-Stop for ≤5 municipalities |
| Casualty loss deduction | Art 72 | Losses from disaster, theft, or embezzlement |
| Spouse deduction | Art 83 | ¥380,000 deduction if spouse income ≤¥480,000/year (taxpayer income ≤¥9m) |
| Dependent deduction | Art 84 | ¥380,000 per qualifying dependent; ¥630,000 for specific dependents (19–22) |
| Home loan deduction (credit) | Special Taxation Measures Act Art 41 | 0.7% of year-end loan balance for up to 13 years (new builds) or 10 years (existing). Max balance varies by building type |

---

## Section 4 — Capital Allowances Optimization

### Accelerated Depreciation for Small Assets

| Asset Cost (JPY) | Treatment | Legislation |
|---|---|---|
| <¥100,000 | Immediately expensed | Income Tax Act Art 67 |
| ¥100,000 – ¥199,999 | 3-year straight-line (lump-sum depreciation, 一括償却) | Art 67-5 |
| ¥100,000 – ¥300,000 (blue return, <300 employees) | Immediately expensed (措置法, Special Taxation Measures Act) — annual aggregate limit ¥3 million | Special Taxation Measures Act Art 28-2 |

### Standard Depreciation

Declining-balance method (定率法) is default for most assets; straight-line (定額法) can be elected. Buildings and building improvements must use straight-line.

| Asset Category | Useful Life (typical) |
|---|---|
| Computer hardware | 4 years |
| Office furniture | 8–15 years |
| Motor vehicles (passenger) | 6 years |
| Buildings (steel-frame) | 34–47 years |
| Software (purchased) | 5 years |

### Vehicle Optimization

No statutory cost cap on vehicle depreciation (unlike Australia or UK). A ¥6 million vehicle depreciates at declining balance over 6 years. High-value vehicles are scrutinised for business-use percentage.

---

## Section 5 — Loss Utilization

### Sole Proprietor (Blue Return)

Blue-return filers can carry forward net losses for 3 years (Art 70). Losses can also be carried back 1 year for a refund of prior-year tax (Art 140) — rarely used by individuals but valuable in loss years.

White-return filers: losses only from casualty, theft, or disaster can be carried forward (3 years). Business losses are not carried forward. **This alone justifies filing blue return.**

### Corporation

Net operating losses carry forward 10 years. SMEs (capital ≤¥100m) can offset 100% of income; large corporations limited to ~50–60% offset per year. Carry-back: 1 year (SMEs only; suspended for large corporations).

### Inter-Income Offsetting (損益通算)

Sole proprietors can offset business losses against other income categories (employment, real estate, etc.) in the same year. Capital losses on listed securities cannot offset non-securities income except in specific cases.

## Section 6 — Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Furusato Nozei before year-end | Donations must be made by 31 December. One-Stop application due by 10 January. Simulator to check optimal amount |
| iDeCo / Shōkibo Kyōsai before December | Contributions in the calendar year create that year's deduction. New iDeCo enrolees: start early — processing takes 1–2 months |
| Accelerate asset purchases | Blue-return sole proprietors: buy assets ≤¥300,000 before year-end for immediate deduction (up to ¥3m aggregate) |
| Defer income | Cash-basis small businesses: delay billing to January. Invoice must be dated and delivered in January |
| Medical expenses — consolidate | Aggregate family medical expenses. If close to ¥100,000 threshold, schedule elective procedures in same calendar year |
| Withholding tax settlement | Year-end adjustment (年末調整, nenmatsu chōsei) for employees handles most credits. Self-employed: file by 15 March |
| Capital gains timing on listed shares | Separate taxation at 20.315% (income + residence). Losses carry forward 3 years within listed-securities income only |

---

## Section 7 — Consumption Tax (消費税) Optimization

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Exemption threshold | Taxable sales ≤¥10 million in base period (2 years prior) → exempt (免税事業者). But qualified invoice issuer registration waives exemption |
| Qualified Invoice System (インボイス制度) | From 1 Oct 2023. Registered businesses issue qualified invoices; buyers need these for input tax credits. Non-registered sellers lose B2B competitiveness |
| Special 20% accommodation | Small businesses newly registered as invoice issuers: may use actual sales tax × 20% as payable amount (effectively 80% relief). Valid through September 2026 |
| Simplified tax system (簡易課税) | Businesses with base-period sales ≤¥50m can elect simplified method: deemed purchase ratio by industry (40%–90%) applied to sales tax. Reduces compliance and often reduces tax for service businesses |
| Input tax credit | Standard method: claim consumption tax on business purchases. Requires qualified invoices from suppliers |
| Timing of registration | Voluntary registration creates consumption tax obligations. If primarily B2C (consumers), staying exempt avoids 10% burden on sales |

---

## Section 8 — Social Insurance Optimization

### NHI vs Shakai Hoken (社会保険)

| System | Coverage | Who | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| National Health Insurance (NHI, 国民健康保険) | Health only | Sole proprietors, freelancers | Income-based; varies by municipality. Capped ~¥1,060,000/year |
| National Pension (国民年金) | Basic pension | Self-employed | Flat ¥16,980/month (2025). Voluntary add-on: National Pension Fund |
| Shakai Hoken (厚生年金 + 健保) | Health + pension | Employees, company directors | ~30% of standard monthly salary (split employer/employee). No cap on health portion after ¥1,390,000 standard salary |

### Optimization Strategies

**Sole proprietor with high income:** NHI premiums cap out at ~¥1,060,000 regardless of income above the cap threshold. Above that level, additional income incurs no additional NHI cost — a marginal advantage over Shakai Hoken (which increases with salary).

**Corporation — director salary setting:** set director salary (hōshū) to optimise total of corporate tax + personal tax + social insurance. Very low salary triggers NTA scrutiny for unreasonable compensation; very high salary increases social insurance cost.

**Shōkibo Kyōsai (小規模企業共済):** retirement fund for sole proprietors and small company directors. Contributions up to ¥84,000/month fully deductible. Lump-sum withdrawal taxed as retirement income (退職所得) with significant exemptions.

**iDeCo stacking:** contributions fully deductible from income. Upon withdrawal at retirement, lump-sum receives retirement income treatment; annuity receives pension income deduction. Layer with Shōkibo Kyōsai for maximum deductions.

---

## Section 9 — Investment & Retirement

| Vehicle | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| NISA (新NISA, from 2024) | Growth investment: ¥2.4m/year; Tsumitate (accumulation): ¥1.2m/year. Lifetime cap ¥18m. Dividends, capital gains, and interest within NISA are permanently tax-free. No time limit |
| iDeCo | Contributions deductible. Growth tax-free. Withdrawal as lump sum → retirement income treatment (退職所得控除); as annuity → pension income deduction (公的年金等控除) |
| Shōkibo Kyōsai | Contributions deductible. Lump-sum → retirement income treatment. Annuity option available |
| National Pension Fund (国民年金基金) | Contributions deductible (combined with iDeCo max ¥75,000/month for Category 1). Annuity taxed as pension income |
| Listed securities | 20.315% separate taxation on capital gains and dividends. Losses carry forward 3 years within securities income |
| Real estate | Rental income taxed at progressive rates. Building depreciation deductible. Losses from real estate offset other income (except certain interest on high-leverage properties) |

### Layering Strategy

For sole proprietors maximising deductions:
1. **iDeCo** — up to ¥75,000/month (Category 1) = ¥900,000/year deduction
2. **Shōkibo Kyōsai** — up to ¥84,000/month = ¥1,008,000/year deduction
3. **National Pension Fund** — remaining room within ¥75,000/month combined iDeCo limit
4. **NISA** — invest after-tax income; all returns tax-free
5. **Furusato Nozei** — redirect taxes to municipalities for return gifts

Combined deduction from iDeCo + Shōkibo alone: ~¥1.9m/year. At 33% national + 10% residence = ~¥820,000 tax reduction.

## Section 10 — Red Lines (GAAR & Scrutiny Triggers)

### Anti-Avoidance Framework

Japan does not have a statutory GAAR like Australia's Part IVA, but the NTA applies:
- Specific anti-avoidance rules per act (e.g., transfer pricing under Special Taxation Measures Act)
- Judicial substance-over-form doctrine
- Blue return revocation for non-compliance with bookkeeping requirements
- Penalty taxes for underreporting (10% additional tax; 15% for large amounts; 35%–40% if fraud)

### NTA Scrutiny Triggers

| Trigger | Risk |
|---|---|
| Unreasonable director salary (too high or too low) | Excess disallowed as corporate deduction (Corporation Tax Act Art 34) |
| Family salary without corresponding work | Disallowed deduction; potential blue return revocation |
| Personal expenses through business | Non-deductible; additional tax |
| Consumption tax evasion via exempt status | NTA reclassification if artificial structure |
| Transfer pricing on related-party transactions | Special Taxation Measures Act adjustment |
| Cryptocurrency gains not reported | NTA data matching with exchanges since 2020 |
| Non-resident income not reported | Global income obligation for residents |
| Excessive depreciation claims | Asset useful life adjusted by NTA |
| Mixing personal and business accounts | Blue return revocation risk |
| Furusato Nozei exceeding deductible limit | No penalty, but excess is non-refundable; pure donation |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- NEVER advise underreporting income or hiding cash transactions
- NEVER advise claiming personal expenses as business deductions
- NEVER set director compensation at levels that cannot be justified
- NEVER advise structuring solely to maintain consumption tax exemption if the arrangement lacks business substance
- NEVER advise filing a white return to avoid bookkeeping obligations — the lost deductions almost always outweigh the effort

## Section 11 — Annual Tax Planning Calendar

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| January | One-Stop Furusato Nozei deadline (10 Jan for prior-year donations). Begin preparing kakutei shinkoku documents |
| February 16 – March 15 | Filing period for income tax return (確定申告). Claim all deductions. Elect blue return for next year if not yet registered |
| March 15 | Filing deadline. Final tax payment due |
| April | Review prior-year assessment. Corporations: set director compensation for new fiscal year |
| June | Residence tax assessment notice arrives. Verify Furusato Nozei credits reflected |
| July – September | Mid-year tax review. Estimate annual income for optimal Furusato Nozei and iDeCo planning |
| October | Confirm iDeCo/Shōkibo contributions on track. Life/earthquake insurance certificate arrives |
| November | Execute year-end tax strategies. Purchase sub-¥300,000 assets. Confirm medical expenses |
| December | **Critical month.** Make Furusato Nozei donations. Final iDeCo/Shōkibo contributions. Year-end adjustment (nenmatsu chōsei) for employees. National Pension catch-up payments |

---

## Section 12 — Cash Impact Examples

### Example 1 — Blue Return vs White Return (Sole Proprietor)

**Income:** ¥8,000,000 business income. No other income.

**White return:** Taxable income = ¥8,000,000 – basic deduction ¥480,000 = ¥7,520,000. National tax: ~¥1,097,100. Residence tax: ~¥752,000. Total: ~¥1,849,100.

**Blue return:** Taxable income = ¥8,000,000 – ¥650,000 (blue deduction) – ¥480,000 (basic) = ¥6,870,000. National tax: ~¥946,500. Residence tax: ~¥687,000. Total: ~¥1,633,500. **Saving: ~¥215,600 per year.**

### Example 2 — Layered Deduction Strategy

**Sole proprietor, ¥12,000,000 income.**
- iDeCo: ¥816,000/year (¥68,000/month)
- Shōkibo Kyōsai: ¥840,000/year
- Blue return deduction: ¥650,000
- Social insurance (NHI + pension): ~¥1,200,000
- Furusato Nozei: ~¥250,000 (net cost ¥2,000)
- Total deductions: ~¥3,756,000
- Taxable income: ~¥7,764,000 (after basic deduction)
- Tax saving vs no planning: **~¥1,300,000 annually** (at ~33%+10% marginal)

### Example 3 — Incorporation at ¥10m Profit

**Before (sole proprietor):** ¥10m profit. After blue deduction and social insurance: ~¥8.2m taxable. Total tax + NHI: ~¥2,870,000.

**After (KK corporation):** Pay ¥6m director salary. Corporate profit ¥4m taxed at ~22% = ¥880,000. Personal tax on ¥6m salary (after employment income deduction ¥1.64m): ~¥970,000. Shakai hoken (employer + employee): ~¥1,700,000. Total: ~¥3,550,000. **Higher in this case** due to Shakai Hoken costs. Incorporation advantage appears at ~¥12–15m+ profit.
