## Section 2 -- Documentation Requirements

### 2.1 Master File (マスターファイル)

|---|---|
| Required? | Yes, where consolidated group revenue of UPE ≥ JPY 100 billion (≈ EUR 750m) in prior FY |
| Format | OECD Annex I to Chapter V |
| Language | Japanese or English |
| Filing | Electronic submission to competent District Director within 1 year after UPE's FY-end |
| Penalty for non-submission | Fine up to JPY 300,000 |

### 2.2 Local File (ローカルファイル)

- Use estimated taxation methods

## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

### 3.1 Definition

Article 66-4(1) ASMT: Where the price of a transaction between a corporation and a foreign related party differs from the arm's length price, the corporation's taxable income is computed using the arm's length price.

### 3.2 Accepted Methods

| Method | Japanese Term | Accepted |
|---|---|---|
| Comparable Uncontrolled Price | 独立価格比準法 (CUP) | Yes |
| Resale Price Method | 再販売価格基準法 (RPM) | Yes |

| Transactional Net Margin Method | 取引単位営業利益法 (TNMM) | Yes |

| Residual Profit Split | 残余利益分割法 | Yes |
| Discounted Cash Flow | DCF法 | Yes (for hard-to-value intangibles) |

### 3.3 Preferred Method

The "most appropriate method" principle applies. Article 66-4(2) provides the methods in order but the NTA applies the best method rule consistent with OECD Guidelines.

### 3.4 Estimation by Tax Authorities

If taxpayer does not provide Local File documentation within the specified period, tax authorities can:
- Use secret comparables (data not available to taxpayer)
