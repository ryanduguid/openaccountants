## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (源泉徴収)

Japanese employers withhold income tax monthly using the NTA's published withholding tax tables (源泉徴収税額表 -- monthly table / 月額表). The tables include the 2.1% reconstruction surtax (復興特別所得税, in effect through 31 December 2037).

### Withholding Table Categories

| Column | Japanese | Criteria |
|---|---|---|
| 甲 (Kō) | Primary employer | Employee has submitted 扶養控除等申告書 (dependency exemption declaration) |
| 乙 (Otsu) | Secondary employer | No declaration filed; flat 3.063% minimum or table rate |

The 甲 table uses the employee's number of dependents (扶養親族等の数) to determine the withholding amount from a lookup table, not a formula.

### Reference: Individual Income Tax Brackets (Annual)

These are the annual rates applied at year-end adjustment (年末調整) or final return (確定申告). Monthly withholding approximates these progressively.

| Taxable Income (JPY) | Rate | Deduction |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 1,950,000 | 5% | ¥0 |
| 1,950,001 -- 3,300,000 | 10% | ¥97,500 |
| 3,300,001 -- 6,950,000 | 20% | ¥427,500 |
| 6,950,001 -- 9,000,000 | 23% | ¥636,000 |
| 9,000,001 -- 18,000,000 | 33% | ¥1,536,000 |
| 18,000,001 -- 40,000,000 | 40% | ¥2,796,000 |
| 40,000,001+ | 45% | ¥4,796,000 |

Plus 2.1% reconstruction surtax on calculated tax. Plus separate resident tax (住民税) at approximately 10% (municipal + prefectural), withheld from June of the following year.

### Employment Income Deduction (給与所得控除 -- 2026)

| Gross Employment Income (JPY) | Deduction |
|---|---|
| Up to 1,625,000 | ¥650,000 (minimum, raised from ¥550,000 in 2026) |
| 1,625,001 -- 1,800,000 | Income × 40% - ¥100,000 |
| 1,800,001 -- 3,600,000 | Income × 30% + ¥80,000 |
| 3,600,001 -- 6,600,000 | Income × 20% + ¥440,000 |
| 6,600,001 -- 8,500,000 | Income × 10% + ¥1,100,000 |
| 8,500,001+ | ¥1,950,000 (cap) |

### Year-End Adjustment (年末調整)

Employers must perform nenmatsu chōsei in December for all 甲 employees. This reconciles monthly withholding to the actual annual tax liability, accounting for insurance deductions, spouse/dependent deductions, and housing loan credits. The employer refunds or collects the difference in the December (or January) payroll.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security: Employee Deductions (社会保険 / 労働保険)

Japanese social insurance premiums are split approximately 50/50 between employer and employee (except workers' compensation which is employer-only and child allowance contribution which was employer-only until 2026).

### Employee Share of Social Insurance (2026)

| Premium | Employee Rate | Basis | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Health insurance (健康保険) | ~4.925% (Tokyo) | Standard monthly remuneration (SMR) | Grade 50: ¥1,390,000/month |
| Long-term care insurance (介護保険) | ~0.810% | SMR | Same as health; ages 40--64 only |
| Welfare pension (厚生年金) | 9.150% | SMR | Grade 32: ¥650,000/month |
| Employment insurance (雇用保険) | 0.50% (from Apr 2026) | Total wages | No ceiling |
| Child-rearing support (子ども・子育て支援金) | 0.115% (from Apr 2026) | SMR | Same as health |

**Health insurance rates vary by prefecture and insurer.** The Tokyo rate shown (9.85% total / 4.925% employee) is illustrative. Each prefecture's Kyōkai Kenpō (協会けんぽ) publishes its own rate.

### Standard Monthly Remuneration (標準報酬月額)

Social insurance premiums are based on the SMR, a standardised salary grade (not actual pay). SMR is determined in September each year (算定基届 santei kiso todoke) based on April--June average earnings. Changes mid-year only occur with significant salary changes (随時改定 zuiji kaitei -- ≥2 grade change sustained over 3 months).

### Bonus Premiums

Social insurance premiums also apply to bonuses at the same rates, subject to annual caps:
- Health insurance: ¥5,730,000 cumulative annual cap on bonus
- Welfare pension: ¥1,500,000 per single bonus payment

## Section 4 -- Social Security: Employer Contributions

### Employer Share of Social Insurance (2026)

| Premium | Employer Rate | Notes |

| Health insurance (Tokyo) | ~4.925% | Same as employee |
| Long-term care insurance | ~0.810% | Same as employee (ages 40--64) |
| Welfare pension | 9.150% | Same as employee |
| Child allowance contribution (子ども・子育て拠出金) | 0.360% | Employer-only; on SMR |
| Child-rearing support (子ども・子育て支援金) | 0.115% | From Apr 2026; same as employee |
| Employment insurance | 0.85% (from Apr 2026) | Higher than employee share |
| Workers' compensation (労災保険) | 0.30% (typical office) | Employer-only; rate varies by industry (0.25%--8.8%) |

### Total Indicative Employer Cost (2026, Tokyo, Age 40--64)

| Component | Rate |
|---|---|
| Health + long-term care | 5.735% |
| Welfare pension | 9.150% |
| Child allowance + child-rearing support | 0.475% |
| Employment insurance | 0.850% |
| Workers' compensation (office) | 0.300% |
| **Total employer social insurance** | **~16.51%** |

For employees under 40 (no long-term care): approximately 15.70%.

| Statutory holiday work (法定休日) | 135% (35% premium) | Art. 37(1) |
| Statutory holiday + late-night | 160% (35% + 25%) | Combined |

### Retirement Allowance (退職金)

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1 -- Standard Monthly Employee (Tokyo, Age 35)

Monthly salary ¥350,000. No dependents (甲 column, 0 dependents). Commuting allowance ¥15,000/month (non-taxable up to ¥150,000/month).

1. Health insurance: ¥350,000 × 4.925% = ¥17,238
2. Welfare pension: ¥350,000 × 9.15% = ¥32,025
3. Employment insurance: ¥365,000 × 0.50% = ¥1,825 (on total wages incl. commuting)
4. Child-rearing support: ¥350,000 × 0.115% = ¥403
5. Income tax: per monthly table 甲, 0 dependents, ¥350,000 minus social insurance = ~¥8,250
6. Resident tax: per municipality notification (e.g., ¥18,000/month)
7. Net pay: ¥350,000 + ¥15,000 - deductions ≈ ¥287,259

Employer additionally pays: ¥17,238 (health) + ¥32,025 (pension) + ¥1,260 (child allowance) + ¥403 (child-rearing) + ¥3,103 (employment ins.) + ¥1,095 (workers' comp) = ~¥55,124

### Pattern 2 -- Bonus Payment (Summer/Winter)

Employee with SMR grade ¥350,000 receives ¥700,000 summer bonus.

1. Health insurance: ¥700,000 × 4.925% = ¥34,475
2. Welfare pension: ¥700,000 × 9.15% = ¥64,050 (under ¥1,500,000 per-bonus cap)
3. Employment insurance: ¥700,000 × 0.50% = ¥3,500
4. Income tax: per bonus withholding table (賞与に対する源泉徴収税額の算出率の表) -- rate based on prior month's social-insurance-deducted salary
5. No resident tax on bonus (already covered by monthly flat amount)

### Pattern 3 -- Mid-Year Salary Change (随時改定)

Employee's base salary increases from ¥300,000 to ¥350,000 in April. If the new SMR grade is 2+ grades different from the current grade, the employer files a 月額変更届. New SMR takes effect from July. Social insurance premiums update from the July payroll.

### Pattern 4 -- Employee on Childcare Leave

Social insurance premiums (both employee and employer shares) are exempt during childcare leave. Employment insurance premiums are not charged on zero-pay months. The employee receives childcare leave benefits from employment insurance (67% for first 180 days, 50% thereafter).
