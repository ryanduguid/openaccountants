## Section 5 -- Financial Statements Entry (決算書コーナー)

---

## Section 8 -- Electronic Signature and Submission

- Restore data if a correction filing (修正申告) is needed

### 8.2 Electronic Signature

Sign the return electronically using your My Number Card:
1. Enter your signature PIN (署名用パスワード -- 6-16 alphanumeric characters)
2. Hold your My Number Card to the smartphone's NFC reader

## Section 9 -- Common Errors and Troubleshooting

| Error Code | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|

| KS-E10001 | Required field missing | Check all mandatory fields are filled |
| KS-E40003 | Balance sheet does not balance | Verify total assets = total liabilities + equity |
| KS-W10035 | Print confirmation | Acknowledge with OK to proceed |
| KS-W90011 | Data will be reset | Acknowledge with OK if intentional |

### QR Code Not Displaying

If the QR code does not appear on the authentication screen:
- Ensure you are using a supported browser (Chrome/Edge on Windows, Safari on macOS)
- Linux is not officially supported by the NTA
- Try refreshing the page

### Authentication Failures

- Ensure the My Number Card is not expired
- Check that the correct PIN is being used (4-digit user authentication PIN, not the 6-16 digit signature PIN)
- Hold the card steady against the phone's NFC reader for several seconds

---

## Section 10 -- Key Deadlines and Calendar

| Item | Deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Income tax filing | March 15 | 確定申告 deadline |
| Income tax payment | March 15 | Same as filing |
| Consumption tax filing | March 31 | Sole proprietors |
| Consumption tax payment | March 31 | Same as filing |
| Account transfer (振替納税) date | Late April (income tax), late April (consumption tax) | Exact date announced annually |
| Estimated tax 1st instalment | July 31 | If prior year tax > JPY 150,000 |
| Estimated tax 2nd instalment | November 30 | If prior year tax > JPY 150,000 |

---

## Section 11 -- Data File Management

### The `.data` File

The 確定申告書等作成コーナー allows saving and loading `.data` files at any point during the process.

| Action | When to Use |
|---|---|
| Save during entry | To create a checkpoint before complex sections |
| Save before submission | To preserve a pre-submission backup |
| Save after submission | To preserve receipt number and submission details |
| Load saved data | To resume from a previous session via "保存データを利用して作成" |

**Best practice:** Save `.data` files at three points: (1) after completing financial statements, (2) before electronic submission, and (3) after successful submission.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER submit a tax return without the taxpayer's explicit confirmation of all figures
- NEVER enter the electronic signature PIN -- this must be done by the taxpayer personally
- NEVER click the final submission button -- this must be done by the taxpayer personally
- NEVER select the JPY 650,000 blue return deduction for paper filing (will cause error KS-E10089)
- NEVER skip the balance sheet balance check -- assets must equal liabilities + equity
- NEVER proceed past the QR code authentication step without confirmation that authentication succeeded
- NEVER present e-Tax filing as a substitute for professional review -- all returns should be reviewed by a 税理士
