## Shinkoku

- Repository: [kazukinagata/shinkoku](https://github.com/kazukinagata/shinkoku)
- License: MIT
- Language: Japanese
- Scope: AI-agent plugin for Japanese tax filing automation, including bookkeeping, income tax, consumption tax, settlement workflows, e-Tax guidance, and browser-assisted filing through the National Tax Agency's 確定申告書等作成コーナー.
- Why it matters: This is the strongest known Japan-native open-source project in the same problem space as OpenAccountants. It is built around agent skills, uses official Japanese tax terminology, and covers practical workflows beyond pure tax formulas.
- Integration approach:
  - Reference Shinkoku for Japan-specific workflow design, terminology, e-Tax process shape, bookkeeping patterns, and validation ideas.
  - Keep OpenAccountants outputs review-first and accountant-facing.
  - Consider future compatibility with Shinkoku's data model or command workflow for users who want a deeper Japan-native tool.

## Current OpenAccountants Usage

The Japan package already credits Shinkoku in `README.md` because parts of the Japan workflow were informed by that project. Future Japan updates should check Shinkoku first before inventing new e-Tax, bookkeeping, consumption tax, or incorporation workflow patterns.
