## Section 8 -- Foreign Founder Considerations

| Physical presence required? | Not for registration (power of attorney accepted); required for visa application |
| Registered office | Must be a physical address in Japan (virtual offices accepted for registration but not for visa) |
| Apostille requirements | Foreign documents require apostille + Japanese translation |
| Corporate seal registration | Mandatory for all companies; representative must register in person or via scrivener |
| Japan-resident bank account | Required for capital deposit; non-residents can use a trusted Japan-resident person's account |

---

## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-JP-F1 -- ¥1 capital and banking.** "While ¥1 capital is legally valid, Japanese banks routinely reject account applications from companies with minimal capital. Recommend at least ¥1,000,000 for banking credibility."

**R-JP-F2 -- Confusing visa capital with legal minimum.** "The legal minimum capital is ¥1, but the Business Manager visa requires ¥30,000,000 since October 2025. These are separate requirements. Always clarify the client's visa intentions before advising on capital."

**R-JP-F3 -- Failure to register for shakai hoken.** "Social insurance (health + pension) registration is mandatory from day 1, even for a single-person company. Non-registration is a violation that can trigger penalties and backdated assessments."

**R-JP-F4 -- Missing 2-week deadline for registry changes.** "Any change to directors, address, or capital must be registered at the Legal Affairs Bureau within 2 weeks. Late registration incurs fines (科料) of up to ¥1,000,000."

**R-JP-F5 -- Paper filing of articles (KK).** "Electronic filing of KK articles saves ¥40,000 in revenue stamps. Always recommend electronic filing via a qualified scrivener."
