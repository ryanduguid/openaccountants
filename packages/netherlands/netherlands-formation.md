## Section 3 -- Registration Process

### Step 1: Engage a Civil-Law Notary (Notaris)
- A Dutch notaris is mandatory for BV formation
- The notaris drafts the deed of incorporation (akte van oprichting) and articles of association (statuten)
- You cannot self-register a BV with KvK

### Step 2: Prepare Articles and Shareholder Agreement
- Statuten define governance, share classes, transfer restrictions, voting rights
- Since Flex-BV (2012): flexible share classes, no minimum capital, no bank statement required
- Shareholder agreement (aandeelhoudersovereenkomst) recommended but not mandatory

### Step 3: Execute Deed of Incorporation
- All founders appear before notaris (or via power of attorney)
- Notaris verifies identity (ID/passport), legal capacity, and compliance with Wwft (AML)
- Minimum share capital: €0.01

### Step 4: KvK Registration
- Notaris registers the BV with KvK (Handelsregister)
- KvK registration fee: €85.15 (from 1 January 2026)
- KvK number and RSIN issued immediately upon registration
- BV legally exists from date of notarial deed (not KvK registration)

### Step 5: Tax Registration (Belastingdienst)
- Automatic notification from KvK to Belastingdienst
- BV receives VAT number (BTW-nummer) and corporate tax number
- DGA (directeur-grootaandeelhouder) must set up payroll for own salary

### Step 6: UBO Register
- Beneficial owners automatically registered via KvK
- Must be updated within 7 days of changes

### Step 7: Open Business Bank Account
- Required for operations (minimum €0.01 capital deposit)
- Increasingly strict KYC for foreign-owned structures

## Section 4 -- Capital Requirements

| Entity Type | Min. Share Capital | Min. Paid-Up | Payment Timing | In-Kind Contributions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BV | €0.01 | No separate paid-up minimum | At or after incorporation | Permitted (beschrijving required; auditor's statement if no bank confirmation) |
| NV | €45,000 | 25% (€11,250) | Before registration | Permitted (auditor's statement required) |
| BV i.o. (in oprichting) | N/A | N/A | Can trade before deed; founders personally liable | N/A |

**DGA salary is the real capital requirement:** For profitable BVs, the director-major shareholder (DGA) must pay themselves at least €58,000 in 2026 (€56,000 in 2025). This is the largest financial commitment, not the share capital.

---

| Share capital | €0.01 (minimum) | Practical: €100--€1,000 recommended |
| Payroll setup (DGA salary) | €200--€500 | Accountant or payroll service |

## Section 8 -- Foreign Founder Considerations

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Non-resident directors allowed? | Yes, but DGA salary rules still apply if 5%+ shareholder |
| Nominee directors permitted? | Yes (but Wwft/AML due diligence applies; UBO must be disclosed) |
| Physical presence required? | No -- power of attorney accepted for notarial deed |
| Apostille requirements | Foreign documents require apostille + certified Dutch or English translation |
| BSN requirement | DGA must obtain a BSN (citizen service number) for payroll; obtainable at municipality |
| EU/non-EU differences | Non-EU directors may need work permit if managing from NL; remote management from abroad is possible |
| 30% ruling | Highly skilled migrants may qualify for 30% tax-free allowance (5 years, conditions apply) |

---

## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-NL-F1 -- Ignoring DGA salary obligation.** "The minimum DGA salary of €58,000 (2026) applies to any BV where the director holds 5%+ of shares. Failure to comply results in Belastingdienst correcting the salary upwards and assessing additional tax + penalties. If the BV cannot yet afford this, apply for dispensation (beschikking lager gebruikelijk loon) proactively."

**R-NL-F2 -- €0.01 capital without working capital.** "While the legal minimum is €0.01, starting a BV with no working capital is impractical. The BV needs funds for operations, the DGA salary, and professional fees. Directors may face personal liability under article 2:248 BW if the company trades while effectively insolvent."

**R-NL-F3 -- Shell company or letterbox entity.** "The Netherlands has substance requirements for holding and financing companies (anti-abuse directives). A BV without real economic activity, employees, or office space may not qualify for treaty benefits and may trigger scrutiny from Belastingdienst."

**R-NL-F4 -- Failing to file annual accounts.** "Every BV must file annual accounts with KvK within 12 months of year-end. Failure to file within 13 months creates a presumption of mismanagement in case of bankruptcy (article 2:248 BW)."

## Section 10 -- Timeline

| Step | Duration | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| Engage notaris and prepare documents | 1--5 days | Day 1--5 |
| Execute deed of incorporation | 1 day | Day 2--6 |
| KvK registration (by notaris) | Same day or 1 day | Day 2--7 |
| Belastingdienst registration (automatic) | 1--3 weeks | Day 9--28 |
| Open bank account | 1--5 days (digital) / 2--6 weeks (traditional) | Day 3--49 |
| DGA payroll setup | 1--5 days | Day 4--54 |
| **Ready to trade** | | **As fast as 1 week (digital bank + simple structure)** |

The Netherlands offers one of the fastest BV formation processes in Europe thanks to the Flex-BV Act.
