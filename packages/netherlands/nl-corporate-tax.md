### VPB Rates 2025 [T1]

| Taxable Profit (EUR) | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — 200,000 | 19.0% | Lower bracket (schijf 1) |
| Over 200,000 | 25.8% | Upper bracket (schijf 2) |

**Formula:** VPB = EUR 200,000 × 19% + (taxable profit − EUR 200,000) × 25.8%

**Rate history (for comparison/audit):**

| Year | Lower bracket | Lower rate | Upper rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2023 | EUR 200,000 | 19.0% | 25.8% |
| 2024 | EUR 200,000 | 19.0% | 25.8% |
| 2025 | EUR 200,000 | 19.0% | 25.8% |

### Fiscal Profit Bridge (Commercial → Fiscal) [T1]

The fiscal profit starts from the commercial accounting result and applies mandatory adjustments:

| Step | Adjustment | Direction |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Commercial net result (jaarrekening) | Starting point |
| 2 | Add back: non-deductible expenses (entertaining 73.5% non-deductible portion, fines, bribes) | + |
| 3 | Add back: excessive interest (earnings stripping — see below) | + |
| 4 | Deduct: participation exemption income (deelnemingsvrijstelling) | − |
| 5 | Apply: different depreciation rules (fiscal vs commercial) | ± |
| 6 | Apply: fiscal reserves (herinvesteringsreserve, etc.) | ± |
| 7 | Deduct: loss carry-forward (if applicable) | − |
| 8 | = Belastbaar bedrag (taxable amount) | Result |

### Earnings Stripping (Renteaftrekbeperking) [T1]

| Rule | Value |
|---|---|
| Threshold | Higher of: EUR 1,000,000 or 20% of fiscal EBITDA |
| Scope | Net interest expense (interest paid − interest received) |
| Legislation | Article 15b Wet Vpb 1969 |

Net interest exceeding the threshold is non-deductible and carried forward indefinitely.

### Loss Relief (Verliesverrekening) [T1]

| Direction | Rule |
|---|---|
| Carry-back | 1 year |
| Carry-forward | Indefinite, but limited per year |
| Annual cap | EUR 1,000,000 + 50% of taxable profit exceeding EUR 1,000,000 |

**Example:** If taxable profit before loss relief = EUR 3,000,000:
- Maximum utilisation = EUR 1,000,000 + 50% × (EUR 3,000,000 − EUR 1,000,000) = EUR 2,000,000

### Participation Exemption (Deelnemingsvrijstelling) [T1]

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Minimum holding | ≥ 5% of nominal share capital |
| Effect | Dividends and capital gains from qualifying participation are fully exempt |
| Legislation | Articles 13–13l Wet Vpb 1969 |
| Anti-abuse | Passive investment holdings excluded (beleggingsdeelneming) unless subject to ≥ 10% effective tax |

### Fiscal Unity (Fiscale Eenheid) [T1]

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Ownership | Parent holds ≥ 95% of shares in subsidiary |
| Jurisdiction | Both entities must be NL-resident (or deemed resident with NL PE) |
| Effect | Consolidated VPB return; intercompany results eliminated |
| Legislation | Articles 15–15aj Wet Vpb 1969 |
| Risk | If conditions cease to be met, unity breaks — potential recapture |

### Innovation Box (Innovatiebox) [T1]

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Effective rate | 9.0% on qualifying innovation profits |
| Qualification | Profits from self-developed intangible assets (with WBSO declaration or patent) |
| Threshold | First EUR 25,000 qualifying profit exempt from regular VPB (drempel) |
| Legislation | Article 12b Wet Vpb 1969 |

### DGA Salary — Gebruikelijk Loon [T1]

| Parameter | Value 2025 |
|---|---|
| Minimum salary | EUR 56,000 (2025) |
| Rule | DGA must receive at least the higher of: minimum threshold, 100% of comparable employees, or highest employee salary |
| Deviation | Allowed only if taxpayer demonstrates that a lower salary is "gebruikelijk" given circumstances |
| Legislation | Article 12a Wet op de loonbelasting 1964 |

| Objection (bezwaar) | 6 weeks after date on assessment |
| Payment final assessment | 6 weeks after date on assessment |

### Conservative Defaults [T1]

| Situation | Default Assumption |
|---|---|
| Uncertain deductibility of expense | Non-deductible — flag for advisor |
| Participation exemption qualification unclear | Do NOT apply — include income; flag |
| Innovation box eligibility unclear | Do NOT apply — use standard rates; flag |
| Fiscal unity status unclear | Treat as standalone entity; flag |
| DGA salary below EUR 56,000 | Flag as non-compliant; compute at minimum |
| Loss carry-forward amount unconfirmed | Do NOT apply — flag for prior-year reconciliation |

### Red Flag Thresholds [T1]

| Flag | Threshold |
|---|---|
| DGA salary below minimum | EUR 56,000 (2025) — compliance risk |
| Intercompany loan without documentation | Transfer pricing risk — flag |
| Net interest > EUR 1,000,000 | Earnings stripping analysis required |
| Holding with < 5% participation | Participation exemption denied — gains taxable |
| Fiscal unity entity becoming non-resident | Unity break risk — recapture |
| Profit > EUR 200,000 in lower bracket | Verify no profit splitting arrangements |

## Section 3 — Computation Workflow

### Step-by-Step VPB Computation

```
1. Start with commercial net result (per annual accounts)
2. Identify and add back non-deductible expenses:
   - Entertainment/representation: 73.5% non-deductible (or choose EUR 5,100 fixed amount)
   - Fines and penalties: 100% non-deductible
   - Bribes: 100% non-deductible
   - Excessive interest (earnings stripping): non-deductible portion
3. Apply fiscal depreciation differences:
   - Buildings: max depreciation to 100% WOZ value (own use) or 50% WOZ (investment)
   - Goodwill: max 10% per year fiscally
4. Apply participation exemption (if qualifying):
   - Remove dividends and gains from ≥5% participations
5. Apply innovation box (if WBSO/patent confirmed):
   - Separate qualifying profits; apply 9% rate
6. Determine taxable amount before loss relief
7. Apply loss carry-forward:
   - Max EUR 1,000,000 + 50% of excess
8. Compute VPB:
   - First EUR 200,000 × 19%
   - Remainder × 25.8%
9. Deduct provisional payments already made
10. = VPB payable / refundable
```

### Non-Deductible Expenses Detail

| Category | Non-deductible portion | Alternative |
|---|---|---|
| Food, drink, entertainment | 73.5% | OR fixed EUR 5,100/year non-deductible |
| Gifts > EUR 227 per recipient | Only portion above EUR 227 deductible per occasion | — |
| Fines (bestuurlijke boetes) | 100% | — |
| Bribes | 100% | — |
| VPB itself | 100% | — |
| Dividend distributions | 100% (not an expense) | — |

### Fiscal Depreciation Limits
