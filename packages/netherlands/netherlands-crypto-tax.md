### Key Principle: Box 3 Wealth Tax — NOT Capital Gains Tax

The Netherlands does **not** tax crypto capital gains for private investors. Instead, crypto is taxed as an asset under Box 3 based on its **value on 1 January** of the tax year. A fictional (notional) return is applied to this value, and tax is levied on that fictional return — regardless of whether the taxpayer actually made or lost money during the year.

### Box 3 Categories and Crypto Classification

| Asset Category | 2025 Notional Return | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Banktegoeden (bank balances) | 1.37% | Savings, current accounts, cash above threshold |
| Beleggingen en overige bezittingen (investments and other assets) | **5.88%** | **Cryptocurrency**, shares, bonds, real estate (not primary home), NFTs |
| Schulden (deductible debts) | 2.70% | Loans, mortgages not in Box 1 |

**Crypto falls under "beleggingen en overige bezittingen" at 5.88% notional return.**

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether trading is hobby or business | Treat as Box 3 (private investment) unless clear business indicators |
| Unknown January 1 valuation | STOP — cannot compute Box 3 without peildatum value |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — affects worldwide vs limited tax obligation |
| DeFi positions with unclear valuation | Estimate fair market value on 1 January; flag for review |
| Staking rewards received during year | Add to Box 3 value on next 1 January; if habitual business, escalate |

---

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — total market value of all crypto holdings in EUR as of 1 January 2025, confirmation of Dutch tax residency, and indication of whether activity is passive holding or active business.

**Recommended** — portfolio snapshots on 1 January from all exchanges (Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitvavo, etc.), wallet balances on 1 January, DeFi position values, and overview of all other Box 3 assets and debts.

**Ideal** — complete Mijn Belastingdienst pre-populated data, portfolio tracker export with January 1 snapshots, full transaction history (to evaluate actual return option), and records of staking/mining activity frequency.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-NLC-1 — Residency unknown.** "Dutch tax residents are subject to Box 3 on worldwide assets. Non-residents may only be taxed on Dutch-source assets. Cannot proceed without confirming tax residency."

**R-NLC-2 — No January 1 valuation.** "Box 3 tax is based entirely on the value of crypto holdings on 1 January. Without this valuation, the tax cannot be computed. Cannot proceed."

**R-NLC-3 — Corporate crypto holdings.** "Companies (BVs, NVs) holding crypto pay vennootschapsbelasting (corporate income tax) on realised and unrealised gains. This skill covers individuals (inkomstenbelasting) only. Escalate to a belastingadviseur."

**R-NLC-4 — Box 1 business classification.** "If crypto activity constitutes a business (onderneming) or work (resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden), it falls under Box 1 with different rules. This requires professional assessment. Escalate."

**R-NLC-5 — Complex international structures.** "Non-resident taxpayers with Dutch crypto assets, or Dutch residents with foreign structures holding crypto, require specialist international tax advice. Escalate."

## Section 3 — Rate Tables and Computation

### 3.1 Box 3 Parameters for 2025

| Parameter | 2025 Value |
|---|---|
| Tax rate | **36%** |
| Heffingsvrij vermogen (tax-free allowance) — single | **€57,684** |
| Heffingsvrij vermogen — fiscal partners (combined) | **€115,368** |
| Notional return: bank balances | 1.37% |
| Notional return: investments & other assets (incl. crypto) | **5.88%** |
| Notional return: debts | 2.70% |
| Debt threshold — single | €3,800 |
| Debt threshold — fiscal partners | €7,600 |

**Citation:** Belastingdienst official calculation page (belastingdienst.nl/box-3); Overbruggingswet box 3; Belastingplan 2025.

### 3.2 Box 3 Computation Steps

1. **Determine asset values on 1 January 2025** — total banktegoeden, total beleggingen en overige bezittingen (including all crypto), total schulden
2. **Calculate notional return per category:**
   - Bank balances × 1.37%
   - Investments & other assets × 5.88%
   - Debts (above threshold) × 2.70%
3. **Taxable return** = (return on banks + return on investments) − return on debts
4. **Capital yield tax base** = total assets − total debts (but debts reduced by threshold)
5. **Effective return %** = taxable return ÷ capital yield tax base
6. **Box 3 income** = (capital yield tax base − heffingsvrij vermogen) × effective return %
7. **Tax** = Box 3 income × 36%

### 3.3 Actual Return Option (Tegenbewijsregeling) — Available from 2025

Since the Hoge Raad (Supreme Court) Kerstarrest (24 December 2021) and subsequent rulings (June 2024), taxpayers can claim their **actual return** if it is lower than the notional return. The Wet tegenbewijsregeling box 3 was enacted on 8 July 2025.

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| How to claim | Via the "Opgaaf Werkelijk Rendement" (OWR) form in Mijn Belastingdienst (available since 10 July 2025) |
| What counts as actual return | Received income (interest, dividends, rent) PLUS realised and unrealised value changes of all Box 3 assets over the calendar year |
| For crypto | Must include both realised gains/losses AND unrealised appreciation/depreciation (1 Jan value vs 31 Dec value) |
| Tax treatment | Belastingdienst automatically applies the more favourable of notional vs actual return |
| Available years | 2017 onwards (for years with open assessments) |

**Key insight:** If crypto prices fell during 2025 but you held a large position on 1 January, the actual return method may produce a lower (or negative) return, reducing your tax liability.

### 3.4 Future: Wet Werkelijk Rendement Box 3 (from 2028)

From 1 January 2028, the system is planned to change fundamentally:
- Tax based on **actual** income: received interest, dividends, rental income, and realised + unrealised value changes
- Heffingsvrij **inkomen** (income exemption) of approximately €1,800 per person replaces heffingsvrij vermogen
- Tax rate expected to remain 36%
- Crypto unrealised gains/losses will be part of the taxable base

---

## Section 4 — Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 Box 3 — No Cost Basis Needed for Standard Computation

Under the standard Box 3 notional return system, **cost basis is irrelevant** — only the market value on 1 January matters.

| Method | Relevance |
|---|---|
| FIFO | Not required for Box 3 notional return |
| Average cost | Not required for Box 3 notional return |
| Specific identification | Not required for Box 3 notional return |

### 4.2 Actual Return (Tegenbewijsregeling) — Cost Basis Required

If claiming actual return, you need:
- Value of all crypto on 1 January and 31 December
- All acquisition costs and disposal proceeds during the year
- The Belastingdienst does not prescribe a specific method for calculating individual trade gains in the actual-return context; the total portfolio return over the year is what matters

### 4.3 Box 1 Business — Cost Basis Required

If crypto activity is classified as Box 1 business income, standard accounting methods apply (typically FIFO or weighted average under good bookkeeping practice — goed koopmansgebruik under Article 3.25 Wet IB 2001).

---

## Section 5 — DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrop Treatment

### 5.1 General Principle

For private investors, all crypto assets and DeFi positions are simply part of Box 3 — valued on 1 January. The nature of the holding (staking, lending, LP tokens) doesn't change the Box 3 treatment; it only matters for valuation.

| Activity | Private Investor (Box 3) | Business/Professional (Box 1) |
|---|---|---|
| Passive holding | Box 3 — value on 1 Jan | N/A |
| Staking (passive, via exchange) | Box 3 — include staking position value on 1 Jan | Box 1 if habitual business activity |
| Mining (occasional) | Box 3 — include mined coins value on 1 Jan | Box 1 if habitual/organised |
| Mining (systematic, with infrastructure) | Likely Box 1 — resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden or winst uit onderneming | Box 1 business income |
| DeFi lending (e.g. Aave) | Box 3 — value of deposited crypto + accrued interest on 1 Jan | Box 1 if part of active trading business |
| Liquidity provision (e.g. Uniswap) | Box 3 — value of LP tokens on 1 Jan | Box 1 if part of active business |
| Active DeFi trading (frequent, systematic) | May be reclassified to Box 1 | Box 1 — resultaat uit overige werkzaamheden |
| Airdrops | Box 3 — value on next 1 Jan if still held | Box 1 if received as part of business activity |

### 5.2 Box 1 Indicators (When Does Crypto Become Business?)

The Belastingdienst applies general income tax principles. There is no specific crypto threshold. Indicators for Box 1 classification:

| Factor | Indicates Box 1 |
|---|---|
| Volume and frequency | Hundreds/thousands of trades, daily activity |
| Specialist knowledge | Use of bots, algorithms, technical analysis |
| Organisation | Dedicated infrastructure, office, employees |
| Time investment | Significant hours spent on trading |
| Leverage and borrowing | Trading with borrowed funds |
| Source of income | Crypto trading is primary income source |

**Box 1 consequences:** Income taxed at progressive rates (up to 49.50% in 2025), but business deductions and losses are available.

### 5.3 Valuation of DeFi Positions on 1 January

| Position Type | Valuation Method |
|---|---|
| Tokens on exchange | Exchange balance × price on 1 Jan |
| Tokens in hardware wallet | Balance × price on 1 Jan (use CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap closing price) |
| Staked tokens (locked) | Market value of underlying tokens on 1 Jan (not the staking derivative) |
| LP tokens (Uniswap, etc.) | Fair market value of the LP position on 1 Jan (underlying tokens × prices) |
| Lending deposits (Aave, Compound) | Principal + accrued interest in crypto × price on 1 Jan |
| Wrapped tokens (WETH, WBTC) | Same as underlying token value |
| Governance tokens (UNI, AAVE, etc.) | Market price on 1 Jan |

---

## Section 6 — NFT Treatment

NFTs are treated as "overige bezittingen" (other assets) in Box 3.

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Holding NFTs | Box 3 — fair market value on 1 January |
| Buying NFTs with crypto | Crypto position decreases, NFT position increases — both valued on next 1 Jan |
| Selling NFTs | Proceeds are part of your overall assets; capital gain is not separately taxed (Box 3 only) |
| Creating and selling NFTs (artist) | If habitual/professional → Box 1 business income |
| NFT valuation challenge | Use last sale price, floor price of collection, or best available fair market estimate |

**Special issue:** Illiquid or unique NFTs with no clear market value — use conservative best estimate and document your methodology. The Belastingdienst may challenge valuations.

---

## Section 7 — Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Aangifte Inkomstenbelasting (Income Tax Return)

| Section | Content |
|---|---|
| Box 3, "beleggingen en andere bezittingen" | Total value of all crypto holdings as of 1 January 2025 in EUR |
| "cryptovaluta" subcategory | Specifically listed in the Box 3 form — enter total EUR value |
| Schulden (debts) | If you have crypto-related debts (margin loans, etc.) above the threshold |
| Werkelijk rendement (if applicable) | Complete the Opgaaf Werkelijk Rendement (OWR) form if actual return < notional return |

**Filing deadline:** 1 May of the following year (extended to 1 September upon request).

### 7.2 What You Do NOT Report

- Individual transactions (buys, sells, swaps)
- Capital gains or losses on individual trades
- Cost basis or FIFO calculations
- Staking/mining reward details

You only report the **total value on 1 January**.

### 7.3 DAC8 / CARF (from 2026)

Crypto exchanges will report Dutch users' transaction data to the Belastingdienst automatically. This will enable cross-referencing of reported Box 3 values against actual holdings.

### 7.4 Record-Keeping

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 7 years (algemene bewaarplicht under Article 52 AWR) |
| Records to maintain | Portfolio snapshots on 1 January of each year, exchange statements, wallet balances, transaction history (especially if claiming actual return or for Box 1 classification) |
| Format | Exchange exports, portfolio tracker screenshots, on-chain records |

---

## Section 8 — Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

### 8.1 Box 3 — No Loss Offset in Standard System

Under the standard notional return system, there is **no concept of losses**. Tax is based on the fictional return, not actual results.

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Crypto lost 50% value during 2025 | Irrelevant under notional return — tax based on 1 Jan value |
| Crypto exchange went bankrupt | If holdings are worthless on next 1 Jan, Box 3 value = €0 for that year |
| Sold all crypto at a loss | No Box 3 liability in following year (no assets on 1 Jan) |

**This means Dutch crypto holders can pay tax even when they lost money — a major source of controversy and the reason for the Kerstarrest reform.**

### 8.2 Actual Return — Negative Return Possible

If using the tegenbewijsregeling (actual return):
- A negative actual return (losses exceed income) results in **€0 Box 3 income** for that year
- Negative returns can NOT be carried forward to offset future years' Box 3 income
- The Belastingdienst applies the more favourable of notional vs actual return

### 8.3 Box 1 — Standard Loss Rules

If classified as Box 1 business income:
- Losses from crypto business can offset other Box 1 income in the same year
- Carry-back: 1 year
- Carry-forward: indefinite (but limited to €1,000,000 + 50% of profits exceeding €1,000,000 per year)

---

## Section 9 — Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 General Anti-Abuse (Fraus Legis)

Dutch tax law includes the doctrine of fraus legis — the Belastingdienst can disregard arrangements entered into primarily for tax avoidance purposes that conflict with the purpose and intent of the law.

### 9.2 Peildatumarbitrage (Reference Date Manipulation)

| Risk | Detail |
|---|---|
| Selling crypto before 31 December and rebuying after 1 January | Legitimate tax planning (Box 3 value on 1 Jan is zero), but must be genuine — if considered artificial, fraus legis may apply |
| Moving crypto to non-reportable structures around 1 January | High audit risk — Belastingdienst is aware of this practice |
| Using stablecoins to "park" value before 1 January | Stablecoins are also crypto — still counted as "overige bezittingen" |

### 9.3 Box Hopping

Moving assets between Box 1, Box 2, and Box 3 to minimise tax is subject to anti-avoidance scrutiny. The Belastingdienst can reclassify.

### 9.4 DAC8 Cross-Referencing (from 2026)

Automatic data exchange will make it much harder to underreport Box 3 crypto values. Exchanges report:
- Account balances
- Transaction volumes
- User identity

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Standard Box 3 Computation

**Input:** Dutch tax resident (single, no fiscal partner). On 1 January 2025:
- Bank balances: €20,000
- Crypto portfolio: €150,000 (BTC, ETH, various altcoins)
- No debts, no other Box 3 assets

**Computation:**
```
Step 1 — Notional return:
  Bank balances:  €20,000 × 1.37%  =   €274.00
  Crypto:        €150,000 × 5.88%  = €8,820.00
  Total return:                       €9,094.00

Step 2 — Capital yield tax base:
  Total assets:  €20,000 + €150,000 = €170,000
  Less debts:    €0
  Tax base:      €170,000

Step 3 — Effective return percentage:
  €9,094 ÷ €170,000 = 5.3494%

Step 4 — Box 3 income:
  (€170,000 − €57,684) × 5.3494% = €112,316 × 5.3494% = €6,008.53

Step 5 — Tax:
  €6,008.53 × 36% = €2,163.07
```

### Example 2 — Actual Return Lower Than Notional

**Input:** Same taxpayer as Example 1. During 2025, crypto portfolio fell from €150,000 (1 Jan) to €90,000 (31 Dec). No crypto was sold. Bank interest earned: €250.

**Actual return computation:**
```
Actual return:
  Bank interest:        €250.00
  Crypto value change:  €90,000 − €150,000 = −€60,000.00
  Total actual return:  €250 + (−€60,000) = −€59,750.00

Since actual return (−€59,750) < notional return (€9,094),
the Belastingdienst uses the actual return.

Actual return is negative → Box 3 income = €0
Tax = €0

Savings compared to notional method: €2,163.07
```

The taxpayer should file the Opgaaf Werkelijk Rendement (OWR) to claim this benefit.

### Example 3 — Crypto Miner (Box 1)

**Input:** Dutch tax resident operates a mining farm with 20 GPUs, dedicated premises, and regular income from mining. Total mining revenue in 2025: €40,000. Electricity and hardware costs: €15,000. No other employment.

**Computation:**
```
Classification: Box 1 — winst uit onderneming (business profits)

Revenue:        €40,000
Expenses:       €15,000
Taxable profit: €25,000

Box 1 tax (2025 rates, approximate):
  Up to €38,441: 36.97%
  €25,000 × 36.97% = €9,242.50

Less: small business deduction (zelfstandigenaftrek) 
  and other Box 1 deductions if applicable.

Mined crypto still held on 1 January: NOT counted in
Box 3 (already in Box 1 as business assets).
```

## Self-Checks

Before delivering any Netherlands crypto tax computation, verify:

- [ ] Residency confirmed — Dutch tax resident (worldwide) or non-resident?
- [ ] 1 January valuation obtained for ALL crypto holdings across ALL platforms and wallets
- [ ] Correct category: crypto is "beleggingen en overige bezittingen" at 5.88% (2025)
- [ ] Heffingsvrij vermogen correctly applied (€57,684 single / €115,368 partners)
- [ ] Fiscal partner status checked — can allocate Box 3 assets optimally
- [ ] Actual return option evaluated — is actual return lower than notional?
- [ ] Box 1 indicators assessed — is activity hobby or business?
- [ ] DeFi positions included in Box 3 at fair market value on 1 Jan
- [ ] Peildatumarbitrage risk flagged if large sales occurred near year-end
- [ ] Output labelled as estimated — flag for professional review

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply capital gains tax to crypto for Dutch private investors — there is no CGT in the Netherlands for Box 3 assets
- NEVER confuse Box 3 notional return with actual gains — the tax is based on fictional return, not real profits (unless actual return option is used)
- NEVER forget that crypto holders pay tax even in loss years under the standard system
- NEVER use mid-year or year-end values — Box 3 is based strictly on 1 January values (peildatum)
- NEVER assume staking/mining is automatically Box 1 — only habitual, organised, business-like activity qualifies
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
- NEVER ignore the actual return option — it can save significant tax in down markets
- NEVER advise on AFM/DNB regulatory matters — this skill covers tax only
- NEVER assume the system will continue unchanged — Box 3 reform (werkelijk rendement) is planned for 2028
