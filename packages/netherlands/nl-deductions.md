## Section 8 — Computation Order

### Complete Deduction Application Order [T1]

```
1. Compute gross income per box:
   - Box 1: employment + business + property (eigen woning)
   - Box 2: substantial interest (aanmerkelijk belang)
   - Box 3: savings and investments (forfaitair)

2. Apply Box 1 business deductions (if applicable):
   - Zelfstandigenaftrek → Startersaftrek → MKB-winstvrijstelling
   - KIA, EIA, MIA (investment deductions)

3. Apply eigen woning saldo:
   - Eigenwoningforfait (add) − mortgage interest (subtract) = saldo
   - If negative: Box 1 deduction
   - If positive: Hillen-aftrek may eliminate part

4. Determine persoonsgebonden aftrek:
   - Sum of: alimentatie + zorgkosten (above drempel) + giften (above floor, within ceiling)
   - Deduct from Box 1 first; if Box 1 insufficient → Box 3 → Box 2

5. Compute tax per box at applicable rates

6. Apply heffingskortingen (tax credits):
   - Algemene heffingskorting (phase-out based on Box 1 income)
   - Arbeidskorting (if employment/business income exists)
   - Other applicable credits (IACK, ouderenkorting, etc.)

7. Final tax payable = Sum box taxes − total credits
   - Minimum EUR 0 (credits cannot create negative tax)
```
