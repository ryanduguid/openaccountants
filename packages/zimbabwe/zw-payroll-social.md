## Zimbabwe Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Verification status:** Tier 2 (research-verified). `verified_by: pending` — this skill has NOT yet been signed off by a registered Zimbabwean tax accountant or ZIMRA-registered tax agent. Every output must be labelled as an estimate and routed to a qualified professional.

> **CRITICAL — Zimbabwe runs a dual-currency payroll system.** Remuneration paid in **USD (foreign currency)** and remuneration paid in **ZiG / ZWG (Zimbabwe Gold, the local currency since April 2024)** are taxed using **two separate PAYE tax tables**. PAYE is remitted to ZIMRA **in the currency in which the income was earned**. You MUST establish the pay currency (or the currency split) before computing anything. The legacy ZWL/RTGS tables are obsolete and must never be used.

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

**Quick Reference table**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |

- **Effective top marginal income tax rate** — 40% × 1.03 (AIDS Levy) = 41.2%  _(PwC, Zimbabwe — significant developments)_

## Section 2 — Income Tax Withholding (PAYE)

Zimbabwe **has** personal income tax, withheld monthly by the employer as **PAYE** and remitted to ZIMRA. PAYE is computed on **taxable remuneration** (gross pay less allowable deductions such as the employee NSSA contribution). The marginal-rate "deduct" tables below collapse the progressive bands into a single line: `Tax = (income × rate) − deduct`.

> Zimbabwe operates a **Final Deduction System (FDS)**: where PAYE is operated correctly, it is the employee's final tax and most employees do not file an annual income-tax return (PwC, Zimbabwe — significant developments).

### 2a. PAYE — USD (Foreign Currency) MONTHLY Table 2025

**PAYE USD Monthly Table 2025**  _(ZIMRA, "PAY AS YOU EARN (PAYE) FOREIGN CURRENCY TAX TABLES FOR JANUARY TO DECEMBER 2025" (official ZIMRA PDF, https://www.zimra.co.zw/domestic-taxes/tax-tables?download=4211:usd-jan-dec-2025-tax-tables))_

### 2b. PAYE — USD (Foreign Currency) ANNUAL Table 2025

**PAYE USD Annual Table 2025**  _(same ZIMRA USD 2025 PDF)_

| Annual taxable income (USD) | Rate | Deduct (USD) |

Daily, weekly and fortnightly USD equivalents are published in the same PDF (e.g. daily: 0% up to USD 3.29; top 40% from USD 98.64). Use the table that matches the pay frequency.

### 2c. PAYE — ZiG / ZWG (Local Currency) MONTHLY Table 2025

**PAYE ZWG Monthly Table 2025**  _(ZIMRA, "PAY AS YOU EARN (PAYE) ZWG TAX TABLES FOR 1 JANUARY TO 31 DECEMBER 2025" (official ZIMRA PDF, https://www.zimra.co.zw/domestic-taxes/tax-tables?download=4205:zwg-2025-tax-tables))_

| 1,008,001 and above | 40% | 112,560 |

### 2e. AIDS Levy

- **AIDS Levy rule** — 3% of the PAYE / individual's tax payable — a surcharge on the tax, not on income. Stated verbatim on both official ZIMRA tax-table PDFs: "Aids Levy is 3% of the Individuals' Tax payable."  _(official ZIMRA tax-table PDFs)_
- **Computation order** — (1) compute PAYE from the bracket table; (2) AIDS Levy = PAYE × 3%; (3) total tax withheld = PAYE + AIDS Levy.
- **Effective top marginal rate** — 40% × 1.03 = 41.2%  _(PwC, Zimbabwe — significant developments)_

## Section 3 — Social Security (NSSA)

NSSA administers two schemes. The **POBS** (pension) is split employee/employer; the **APWCS** (workers' compensation) is employer-only.

### 3a. Pension and Other Benefits Scheme (POBS)

**POBS rate table**  _(NSSA, "Contributions" (https://www.nssa.org.zw/contributions/); corroborated by M&J Consultants ("NSSA Rates 2025"))_

| Component | Employee | Employer | Combined |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POBS rate | 4.5% of insurable earnings | 4.5% of insurable earnings | **9.0%** |

Employee 4.5% + Employer 4.5% = **9.0%** combined. ✓

- **Insurable earnings ceiling** — USD 700/month (introduced mid-2024, retained for 2025). Maximum contribution = USD 31.50 each / USD 63.00 total per month for anyone earning ≥ USD 700 (4.5% × 700 = 31.50; ×2 = 63.00). ✓

The ceiling is gazetted quarterly — verify the current quarter's figure before each payroll run (NSSA Schedule of Insurable Earnings, https://www.nssa.org.zw/scheduleofinsurableearnings/). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the ceiling applicable to the specific pay period; USD 700 was the 2024/2025 level.]**

For ZiG-paid employees, NSSA applies the gazetted ZiG-equivalent ceiling for the quarter. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current ZiG-equivalent insurable-earnings ceiling.]**

- **Employee POBS deductibility** — Employee POBS contributions are deductible when computing taxable income for PAYE (subtract before applying the PAYE table).
- **Remittance deadline** — 10th of the following month

### 3b. Accident Prevention & Workers' Compensation Scheme (APWCS / WCIF)

**APWCS rate table**  _(NSSA guidance; M&J Consultants ("PAYE, NSSA and ZIMDEF"))_

| Component | Employee | Employer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| APWCS rate | 0% (employee pays nothing) | **Varies by industry-risk (IC) code** on the monthly insurable wage bill |

- **IC code example** — Employer-only. The rate depends on the employer's industry-risk classification (IC) code assessed by NSSA. Published example: IC Code 0110 = 1.38% → on a USD 5,000 wage bill = USD 69.00/month (5,000 × 1.38% = 69.00). ✓

Low-risk sectors (offices, retail) attract lower rates; high-risk sectors (mining, construction) attract higher rates.

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the employer's exact APWCS rate from its NSSA assessment notice. A complete 2025 IC-code rate schedule was not obtainable from an authoritative source; only the IC 0110 = 1.38% example is published.]**

## Section 4 — ZIMDEF Manpower Development Levy

**ZIMDEF levy table**  _(ZIMDEF FAQs (https://zimdef.org.zw/faqs/); Manpower Planning & Development Act (Ch. 28:02), SIs 74 & 392 of 1999)_

| Component | Employee | Employer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZIMDEF levy | 0% | **1% of the gross monthly wage bill (leviable items)** |

- **Employer-only training levy** — Employer-only training levy.
- **Remittance deadline** — within 30 days after month-end
- **Leviable remuneration** — Leviable remuneration is broad: salaries, wages, commissions, bonuses, directors' fees/emoluments, allowances (housing, cost-of-living, education), benefits in kind, and employer pension/medical contributions. NSSA contributions are excluded from the leviable base.  _(M&J Consultants, "PAYE, NSSA and ZIMDEF")_
- **Non-compliance** — Failure to register / remit is a criminal offence.

### Employer statutory cost summary (per employee, monthly)

**Employer statutory cost summary**

| Charge | Who pays | Rate / basis | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POBS pension | Employer | 4.5% of insurable earnings (cap USD 700) | NSSA Contributions |
| APWCS / WCIF | Employer | Industry-rated (e.g. IC 0110 = 1.38%) | NSSA guidance |
| ZIMDEF | Employer | 1% of leviable wage bill | ZIMDEF FAQs |

**Self-check — employer charges are distinct lines, no double-count:** POBS (4.5%) + APWCS (industry %) + ZIMDEF (1%) are three separate remittances to two authorities (NSSA, ZIMDEF). The employer does **not** pay AIDS Levy or PAYE out of its own funds — those are withheld from the employee. ✓

## Section 5 — Minimum Wage

**Minimum wage table**  _(SI 186 of 2024; National Employment Council (NEC) collective bargaining agreements; Veritas / Herald reporting)_

| Item | Value | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| National minimum wage | **USD 150/month** (or ZiG equivalent) | SI 186 of 2024 (first general statutory minimum wage) |
| Sector minimum wages | Set by ~22 NECs, gazetted as SIs, legally binding per sector; usually higher than the SI 186 floor | NEC CBAs |
| Example — Agriculture grade A1 | USD 80/month (eff. 1 June 2025) | Agriculture NEC CBA **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current grade rates]** |
| Example — Agriculture grade C2 | USD 159/month (eff. 1 June 2025) | Agriculture NEC CBA **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current grade rates]** |

> **Currency-split rule:** workers are generally paid **65% in USD** and the remainder in ZiG. This split determines which PAYE table applies to each portion of pay. **[RESEARCH GAP — the 65/35 split is a market norm, not a uniform statutory rule; reviewer to confirm the contractual / NEC split for the specific employer.]**

## Section 6 — Conservative Defaults

When a required input is missing and the user asks you to proceed anyway, apply the **most conservative** assumption (the one least likely to under-withhold tax or under-state a statutory liability), flag it loudly, and queue it for reviewer confirmation. Never silently guess.

**Conservative defaults table**

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pay currency | Treat as **USD** and apply the USD PAYE table | Avoids mis-applying the ZiG threshold; but DO NOT finalise — currency drives everything. Flag hard. |
| Currency split (USD/ZiG) | Apply PAYE separately to each stated portion; if unknown, treat full pay in the stated currency | Splitting across two tables understates tax if done wrong |
| NSSA insurable ceiling | Use **USD 700/month** (2024/2025 gazetted level) | Latest confirmed figure; flag that it is gazetted quarterly |
| APWCS IC rate | Do **not** invent a rate — leave as `[reviewer to supply IC rate]` | No authoritative full schedule exists |
| Employee NSSA deductibility | Deduct employee POBS before PAYE | Statutorily allowed; omitting it over-withholds tax |
| Tax-free threshold currency | Match threshold to pay currency (USD 100 vs ZWG 2,800) | Mixing currencies corrupts the base |
| Pay frequency | Assume **monthly** | Most common; use monthly tables |

## Section 7 — Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs (gather before any computation)

- **Required inputs list** — 1. **Pay currency** — USD, ZiG/ZWG, or a stated split (and the split ratio). 2. Gross remuneration for the period, broken into taxable and non-taxable components. 3. Employee NSSA (POBS) membership status (most formal-sector employees are members). 4. Employer's **APWCS IC-code rate** (from the NSSA assessment notice). 5. Pay frequency and the specific pay period. 6. Any allowances / benefits in kind (affect both PAYE base and the ZIMDEF leviable base). 7. Whether the employer is registered with ZIMRA (BP number), NSSA, and ZIMDEF.

### Refusal Catalogue — STOP and ask; do not produce numbers

- **Pay currency not stated** — **Refuse to compute.** Ask: "Is this employee paid in USD, ZiG/ZWG, or a split? Zimbabwe uses separate PAYE tables per currency."
- **Legacy ZWL/RTGS figures supplied** — **Refuse.** Tell the user the ZWL/RTGS tables are obsolete; payroll since April 2024 is USD or ZiG/ZWG.
- **APWCS rate requested but no IC code/assessment** — Compute everything else; leave APWCS as `[reviewer to supply IC rate]`. Do not invent a percentage.
- **User asks to omit AIDS Levy** — **Refuse.** AIDS Levy (3% of PAYE) is mandatory on all PAYE.
- **User asks to skip employee NSSA to "simplify"** — Flag that omitting the POBS deduction over-withholds PAYE; confirm membership before excluding.
- **No employee data at all** — Stop; list the required inputs above.
- **Request to present output as final/filed** — **Refuse.** Output is an estimate pending a registered Zimbabwean tax agent's sign-off.

## Section 8 — Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Apply these classifications **in order**; first match wins. Currency tags (USD / ZiG) help disambiguate which PAYE table the underlying pay used.

### 8a. Salary credits (money INTO an employee account)

**Salary credits table**

| Bank-statement text (typical) | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `SALARY`, `MUHOLO` (Shona: wages/pay), `MUVUZO`, `WAGES`, `PAY` | Net salary payment |
| `EMPLOYER [name] TRF`, `STAFF SALARY`, `PAYROLL CR` | Net salary payment |
| `ALLOWANCE`, `HOUSING ALLOW`, `TRANSPORT ALLOW` | Allowance (taxable unless specifically exempt) |
| `BONUS`, `13TH CHEQUE` | Bonus (taxable; included in ZIMDEF leviable base) |
| `NSSA REFUND` | NSSA adjustment — not income |

### 8b. Employer statutory debits (money OUT of the employer account)

**Employer statutory debits table**

| Bank-statement text (typical) | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `ZIMRA`, `ZIMRA SINGLE ACCOUNT`, `PAYE`, `P2 PAYMENT` | PAYE + AIDS Levy remittance to ZIMRA |
| `ZIMRA AIDS LEVY` | AIDS Levy component (if shown separately) |
| `NSSA`, `NSSA POBS`, `NSSA PENSION` | NSSA POBS pension remittance |
| `NSSA APWCS`, `NSSA WCIF`, `ACCIDENT FUND` | NSSA workers' compensation remittance (employer) |
| `ZIMDEF`, `MANPOWER LEVY`, `TRAINING LEVY` | ZIMDEF 1% levy remittance |
| `NET WAGES`, `SALARY RUN`, `PAYROLL` | Salary disbursement to employees |

> Currency note: ZIMRA remittances are made in the **currency the income was earned in** (USD pay → remit in USD; ZiG pay → remit in ZiG) into the **ZIMRA Single Bank Account**.

## Section 9 — Worked Examples

> All figures are **estimates** for illustration. Recomputed end-to-end below. Round to the cent.

### Example 1 — USD salary, mid-band employee

- Gross monthly pay: **USD 1,500**, paid entirely in USD. NSSA member.
- **Employee NSSA (POBS):** 4.5% × min(1,500, 700 ceiling) = 4.5% × 700 = **USD 31.50**.
- **PAYE taxable income:** 1,500 − 31.50 = **USD 1,468.50** (falls in 1,000.01–2,000 band → 30%, deduct 85).
- **PAYE:** 1,468.50 × 0.30 − 85 = 440.55 − 85 = **USD 355.55**.
- **AIDS Levy:** 355.55 × 0.03 = **USD 10.67** (10.6665 → 10.67).
- **Total tax withheld:** 355.55 + 10.67 = **USD 366.22**.
- **Net pay:** 1,500 − 31.50 − 366.22 = **USD 1,102.28**.
- **Employer cost on top:** POBS 31.50 + ZIMDEF (1% × 1,500 = 15.00) + APWCS `[reviewer to supply IC rate]`.

### Example 2 — USD salary, top-band executive

- Gross monthly pay: **USD 5,000**, USD. NSSA member.
- **Employee NSSA:** 4.5% × 700 (ceiling) = **USD 31.50**.
- **Taxable income:** 5,000 − 31.50 = **USD 4,968.50** (above 3,000 → 40%, deduct 335).
- **PAYE:** 4,968.50 × 0.40 − 335 = 1,987.40 − 335 = **USD 1,652.40**.
- **AIDS Levy:** 1,652.40 × 0.03 = **USD 49.57** (49.572 → 49.57).
- **Total tax withheld:** 1,652.40 + 49.57 = **USD 1,701.97**.
- **Net pay:** 5,000 − 31.50 − 1,701.97 = **USD 3,266.53**.
- **Employer ZIMDEF:** 1% × 5,000 = USD 50.00. **APWCS (illustrative IC 0110 = 1.38%):** 1.38% × 5,000 = USD 69.00.

### Example 3 — USD salary below the tax-free threshold

- Gross monthly pay: **USD 90**, USD. NSSA member.
- **Employee NSSA:** 4.5% × 90 = **USD 4.05** (below the 700 ceiling).
- **Taxable income:** 90 − 4.05 = **USD 85.95** (≤ 100 → 0% band).
- **PAYE:** 0. **AIDS Levy:** 0 (3% of zero). **Total tax:** **USD 0.00**.
- **Net pay:** 90 − 4.05 = **USD 85.95**.
- Note: USD 90 is below the SI 186 of 2024 national minimum wage of USD 150 — flag a potential minimum-wage breach to the reviewer.

### Example 4 — ZiG/ZWG salary, mid-band employee

- Gross monthly pay: **ZWG 40,000**, paid entirely in ZiG. NSSA member.
- **Employee NSSA:** 4.5% × ZiG insurable earnings, capped at the gazetted ZiG-equivalent ceiling. **[RESEARCH GAP — ZiG ceiling not confirmed; this example assumes pay is at/below the ceiling, so NSSA = 4.5% × 40,000 = ZWG 1,800. Reviewer to confirm the ZiG ceiling.]**
- **Taxable income (assuming NSSA = 1,800):** 40,000 − 1,800 = **ZWG 38,200** (28,000.01–56,000 → 30%, deduct 2,380).
- **PAYE:** 38,200 × 0.30 − 2,380 = 11,460 − 2,380 = **ZWG 9,080**.
- **AIDS Levy:** 9,080 × 0.03 = **ZWG 272.40**.
- **Total tax withheld:** 9,080 + 272.40 = **ZWG 9,352.40**.
- **Net pay:** 40,000 − 1,800 − 9,352.40 = **ZWG 28,847.60**.
- ZIMRA remittance is made **in ZiG** into the ZIMRA Single Bank Account.

### Example 5 — Split pay (65% USD / 35% ZiG)

- Total gross: **USD 1,000-equivalent**, split 65% USD / 35% ZiG. Apply the relevant PAYE table to each portion. **[RESEARCH GAP — split-pay PAYE mechanics (whether thresholds apply once or per currency) should be confirmed with ZIMRA / a tax agent; conservative approach: apply each currency's table to its own portion and remit each in its own currency.]**
- **USD portion:** USD 650. Employee NSSA 4.5% × 650 = USD 29.25. Taxable 650 − 29.25 = 620.75 (300.01–1,000 → 25%, deduct 35). PAYE = 620.75 × 0.25 − 35 = 155.19 − 35 = **USD 120.19** (155.1875 → 120.19). AIDS Levy = 120.19 × 0.03 = **USD 3.61** (3.6057 → 3.61).
- **ZiG portion:** assume ZWG-equivalent of the remaining 35%. Compute on the ZWG monthly table per Section 2c. **[RESEARCH GAP — requires the USD/ZiG exchange rate for the period; reviewer to supply.]**
- Remit USD PAYE in USD and ZiG PAYE in ZiG. Do **not** net the two currencies.

## Section 10 — Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — always apply)

- **Tier 1 Rules** — 1. Establish **pay currency** first; select the matching PAYE table (USD = Section 2a/2b; ZiG = Section 2c/2d). Never mix. 2. Deduct the **employee NSSA (POBS) 4.5%** (capped) before applying the PAYE table. 3. Compute PAYE as `income × rate − deduct` from the correct frequency table. 4. Apply **AIDS Levy = PAYE × 3%** after PAYE, never on gross income. 5. Total employee tax withheld = PAYE + AIDS Levy. 6. Employer pays POBS 4.5%, APWCS (industry-rated), and ZIMDEF 1% **separately** — never deducted from the employee. 7. Remit PAYE + AIDS Levy to ZIMRA via **Form P2** by the **10th of the following month**, in the currency earned. 8. Remit NSSA by the 10th; remit ZIMDEF within 30 days of month-end. 9. Never use legacy ZWL/RTGS tables. 10. Label every output as an estimate pending professional sign-off.

## Section 11 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

**Tier 2 Catalogue table**

| Item | Why it needs judgement |
| --- | --- |
| Current NSSA insurable-earnings ceiling | Gazetted quarterly; USD 700 was 2024/2025 |
| ZiG-equivalent NSSA ceiling | Not confirmed in research data |
| Employer APWCS IC-code rate | No authoritative full schedule; assessment-specific |
| Taxability of specific allowances / benefits in kind | Depends on ZIMRA treatment of each item |
| Split-pay PAYE mechanics across two currencies | Threshold application uncertain; confirm with ZIMRA |
| Applicable NEC sector minimum wage | ~22 sectors, each with its own gazetted SI |
| USD/ZiG exchange rate for split or conversion | Period-specific; reviewer to supply |
| Late-PAYE penalty quantum | Applied per ZIMRA assessment (see Section 14) |

## Section 12 — Excel Working Paper Template

**Excel Working Paper Template**

| Col | Field | Formula / source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Employee name / ID | input |
| B | Pay currency (USD / ZWG) | input |
| C | Gross pay (this currency) | input |
| D | Insurable earnings (capped) | `=MIN(C, ceiling)` (ceiling = USD 700 or gazetted ZiG figure) |
| E | Employee NSSA (POBS) | `=D*0.045` |
| F | Taxable income | `=C-E` |
| G | PAYE marginal rate | lookup vs Section 2a (USD) or 2c (ZWG) table |
| H | PAYE deduct | lookup (same row as G) |
| I | PAYE | `=F*G-H` (floor at 0) |
| J | AIDS Levy | `=I*0.03` |
| K | Total tax withheld | `=I+J` |
| L | Net pay | `=C-E-K` |

| N | Employer APWCS | `=C*IC_rate` (IC rate from NSSA assessment — `[reviewer]`) |
| O | Employer ZIMDEF | `=leviable_base*0.01` |

> Check totals: Σ(K) across USD employees = PAYE+AIDS to remit to ZIMRA in USD; Σ(K) across ZWG employees = remit in ZiG. Keep currencies in separate sheets — never sum across currencies.

## Section 13 — Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

**Terminology guide table**

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |

## Section 14 — Filing, Penalties & Onboarding Fallback

### Filing obligations

**Filing obligations table**

| Obligation | Form / channel | Deadline | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Monthly PAYE + AIDS Levy | Form **P2** via TaRMS portal | **10th of following month** | ZIMRA, PAYE Explained |
| NSSA (POBS + APWCS) | NSSA channels | **10th of following month** | NSSA Contributions |
| ZIMDEF levy | ZIMDEF | **within 30 days after month-end** | ZIMDEF FAQs |
| Employer registration | ZIMRA (BP number) before operating PAYE | Before first payroll | ZIMRA **[RESEARCH GAP — exact registration-page figures not retrievable]** |

- Payments are made into the **ZIMRA Single Bank Account**, **in the currency in which the income was earned**.
- Under the **FDS**, correctly-operated PAYE is final; most employees do not file an annual return (PwC, Zimbabwe).

### Penalties / interest

- **Late-PAYE interest** — 10% per annum on late-remitted PAYE (stated on the P2 PAYE return form)  _(P2 PAYE return form)_
- **Penalties and ITF263 disqualification** — Late / non-remittance also triggers penalties and disqualification from a Tax Clearance Certificate (ITF263).

**[RESEARCH GAP — no single authoritative flat-penalty percentage for late PAYE was found; ZIMRA applies penalties per assessment under the Income Tax Act and Revenue Authority statutes. State as "per ZIMRA assessment," not a fixed figure.]**

### Onboarding fallback

If the employer is not yet registered with ZIMRA / NSSA / ZIMDEF, stop and tell the user: registration (ZIMRA BP number, NSSA employer registration, ZIMDEF registration) must be completed before PAYE and statutory contributions can be lawfully operated. Route to a registered Zimbabwean tax agent for onboarding.

## Section 16 — Test Suite

Each test recomputed end-to-end. Use these to validate any implementation.

1. **USD 100 exactly →** PAYE = 0 (within 0% band, ≤ 100). AIDS = 0. ✓
2. **USD 100.01 →** taxable 100.01 (before NSSA): 100.01 × 0.20 − 20 = 20.002 − 20 = **USD 0.00** (0.002 ≈ 0; band entry point). ✓
3. **USD 700 NSSA cap →** employee POBS = 4.5% × 700 = **USD 31.50** (max); USD 1,000 gross still caps at 31.50. ✓
4. **USD 1,500 (Example 1) →** PAYE 355.55, AIDS 10.67, net 1,102.28. ✓
5. **USD 5,000 (Example 2) →** PAYE 1,652.40, AIDS 49.57, net 3,266.53; ZIMDEF 50.00. ✓
6. **ZWG 2,800 exactly →** PAYE = 0 (top of 0% band). ✓
7. **ZWG 8,400 →** 8,400 × 0.20 − 560 = 1,680 − 560 = **ZWG 1,120**; AIDS = 33.60. ✓
8. **ZWG 40,000 (Example 4) →** PAYE 9,080, AIDS 272.40, net 28,847.60 (NSSA 1,800 assumed). ✓
9. **AIDS Levy isolation →** PAYE 1,000 → AIDS = 1,000 × 0.03 = **30.00**; total 1,030. ✓
10. **POBS combined →** 4.5% + 4.5% = 9.0% of insurable earnings. ✓
11. **APWCS example →** USD 5,000 wage bill × 1.38% (IC 0110) = **USD 69.00**. ✓
12. **ZIMDEF →** USD 5,000 leviable × 1% = **USD 50.00**. ✓
13. **Currency guard →** unspecified currency must trigger the Section 7 refusal (no number produced). ✓
14. **Legacy guard →** ZWL/RTGS input must trigger refusal. ✓

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Prohibitions list** — - NEVER compute Zimbabwe payroll without first establishing the **pay currency** (USD vs ZiG/ZWG) — the tables are different. - NEVER use the legacy **ZWL / RTGS** tax tables — they are obsolete since the ZiG transition (April 2024). - NEVER apply the AIDS Levy to gross income — it is **3% of PAYE**, computed after PAYE. - NEVER omit the AIDS Levy from any PAYE computation. - NEVER compute employee NSSA above the gazetted insurable-earnings ceiling (USD 700/month, or the current quarter's figure). - NEVER invent an APWCS IC-code rate — leave it for the reviewer to supply from the NSSA assessment. - NEVER net USD and ZiG PAYE together — remit each in the currency the income was earned in. - NEVER deduct employer POBS, APWCS, or ZIMDEF from the employee — they are employer costs. - NEVER miss the P2 PAYE deadline (10th of the following month) — 10% p.a. interest and penalties apply. - NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a registered Zimbabwean tax agent / accountant.
