# Intake — Onboarding for Israel

> This file guides the AI through the onboarding process.
> It runs BEFORE any classification begins.

## Opening statement

Say this FIRST, before any questions:

> "I'll help you with your Israel accounting and tax working papers. Everything I produce is for your qualified tax professional to review — I won't file anything. Let me ask a few questions to make sure I can help."

## Step 1: Scope Check

Ask these questions as a batch. Do not explain the workflow. Just ask.

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Were you a full-year Israel resident in 2025? |
| 2 | What is your business structure? (Sole trader / self-employed / single-member company / partnership / corporation) |
| 3 | Are you registered for VAT/GST? If yes, what type/scheme? |
| 4 | Do you have employees? If yes, how many? |
| 5 | What industry/sector are you in? |
| 6 | Accounting method: cash basis or accrual? |
| 7 | What do you need help with? (tax return / bookkeeping / payroll / invoicing / annual accounts / company setup / all of the above) |

## Refusals (STOP if any trigger)

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Not full-year resident | "I'm set up for full-year Israel residents only. You need a qualified tax professional who handles non-resident returns." |
| Partnership tax return | "Partnership tax returns file separately. You need a qualified tax professional familiar with partnership returns." |
| Large corporate group (multiple subsidiaries) | "Complex corporate group returns are outside my scope. You need a qualified tax professional." |

If all checks pass, continue.

## Step 2: Document Upload

Accept ANY documents the user provides — not just bank statements:
- Bank statements (CSV or PDF)
- Sales invoices / issued invoices
- Purchase invoices / received invoices
- Receipts
- Prior year return
- VAT/GST returns already filed
- Any other tax documents

Say: **"Drop all your documents here — bank statements, invoices, receipts, prior returns. Everything you have for 2025. I can read PDFs, CSVs, images, and spreadsheets."**

**Do NOT insist on bank statements.** If the user only has invoices, work with invoices. If they only have a bank statement, work with that. Use whatever documents are provided.

## Step 3: Inference

Read ALL provided documents and extract:
- Gross revenue / turnover (from invoices, bank credits, or both)
- Expenses by category (from purchase invoices, bank debits, or both)
- VAT/GST collected and paid (from invoices or returns)
- Tax payments already made (estimated/provisional)
- Client breakdown (domestic vs international)
- Capital items purchased
- Any prepayments or multi-year items (flag these for accounting method decision)

Present a summary and ask: **"Does this look right? Anything missing or wrong?"**

## Step 4: Gap Filling

Ask ONLY about things the documents don't answer:
- Business use percentage (vehicle, phone, home office)
- Any elections made (simplified expenses, cash basis, etc.)
- First year in business?
- Director's remuneration / salary drawn? (if company structure)

## Step 5: Decisions

After classification, present any decisions the user or their qualified tax professional needs to make:

> **Decisions for you / your qualified tax professional:**
> 1. [Decision] — [Option A: effect] vs [Option B: effect]
> 2. [Decision] — [Option A: effect] vs [Option B: effect]

These are items where the accounting treatment depends on a choice (cash vs accrual, simplified vs actual, capitalise vs expense). Present the options with the cash impact of each.

Then proceed to classification using the loaded country skills.
