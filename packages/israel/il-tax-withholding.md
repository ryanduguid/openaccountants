### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| No withholding certificate provided | Apply default rate for payment type |
| Certificate year not verified | Treat as expired — apply default rate |
| Unknown whether payee is resident or non-resident | Treat as non-resident (25% rate) |
| Payment type unclear | Apply 30% services default |
| Unknown whether payer exceeds mandatory withholder threshold | Withhold to be safe |

---

## Section 2 — Default withholding rates

### 2.1 Rates by payment type (no certificate)

| Payment type | Hebrew | Default rate | ITO Section |
|---|---|---|---|
| Services — individuals, no certificate | שלומים עבור שירותים | 30% (up to ~47% for unverified payees) | 164 |
| Services — companies, no certificate | שלומים עבור שירותים | 20–30% by ITA classification | 164 |
| Rent — business/commercial property | שכירות נכסי נדל"ן | 35% | 170 |
| Rent — residential property | שכר דירה למגורים | 30% | 170 |
| Royalties | תמלוגים | 23% | 170 |
| Interest | ריבית | 25% | 164 |
| Dividends | דיבידנדים | 25–30% | 164 |
| Payments to non-residents | תשלומים לתושבי חוץ | 25% | 170 |

**The "20% flat" figure from older guidance is incorrect.** The ITA default for a service payment with no certificate is 30%, and the tax office can set it as high as ~47% for an unverified payee. A valid certificate is what brings the rate down (often to 0–5%).

### 2.2 De minimis threshold

A single payment to a payee below approximately NIS 5,520 (annually indexed) does not require withholding, unless cumulative payments to that payee cross the threshold. Always verify the current-year threshold.

## Section 3 — Withholding certificates

### 3.1 Certificate types

| Certificate | Hebrew | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Ishur Nikui Mas BeMakor | אישור ניכוי מס במקור | Reduced or zero withholding on payments received |
| Ishur Tium Mas | אישור תיאום מס | Tax coordination for individuals with multiple payers/employers |
| Ishur Nikui Mas Rechisha | אישור ניכוי מס רכישה | Real estate purchase tax withholding |

### 3.2 Verifying a certificate

When a payee presents a withholding certificate:

1. **Verify the year** — certificates are valid for the current tax year (January–December) only
2. **Verify the payee's identity** — business name, TIN (taxpayer identification number), and approved rate must match
3. **Verify online** — use the ITA gmishurim service to confirm certificate status: https://taxinfo.taxes.gov.il/gmishurim/firstPage.aspx
4. **Check validity period** — some certificates have shorter validity than the full year

### 3.3 Obtaining a certificate

1. Apply through the ITA online services (gmishurim system)
2. Provide: TIN, financial statements, tax returns
3. Certificate valid for the current tax year
4. Renewal required annually — certificates expire December 31

## Section 4 — Withholding calculation

### 4.1 Basic calculation

```
Payment amount (before VAT):    X NIS
Withholding rate:               Y% (from certificate, or default)
Withholding amount:             X × Y%
Net payment to payee:           X − Withholding amount
VAT (if applicable):            Calculated separately on the full pre-withholding amount
```

### 4.2 Worked example — Payment to freelancer

**Scenario:** Business pays NIS 10,000 to a freelancer (Osek Murshe) for consulting, no certificate.

| Line | Amount (NIS) |
|---|---|
| Gross payment (before VAT) | 10,000 |
| Withholding (30% default) | 3,000 |
| Net payment to freelancer | 7,000 |
| VAT (18% on gross) | 1,800 |
| Total paid by business | 8,800 (net 7,000 + VAT 1,800) |

If the freelancer provides a valid certificate showing 2% withholding:

| Line | Amount (NIS) |
|---|---|
| Gross payment (before VAT) | 10,000 |
| Withholding (2% per certificate) | 200 |
| Net payment to freelancer | 9,800 |
| VAT (18% on gross) | 1,800 |
| Total paid by business | 11,600 (net 9,800 + VAT 1,800) |

### 4.3 Cross-border payments

For payments to non-residents:
- Default: 25% withholding
- Tax treaty may reduce the rate — check the Israel–[country] treaty
- Common treaties: US-Israel, UK-Israel, Germany-Israel, France-Israel
- Treaty benefits require documentation and proper application
- Treaty list: https://www.gov.il/he/departments/guides/taxation-agreements

## Section 5 — Periodic reporting (Form 102)

### 5.1 Filing obligation

Amounts withheld must be reported and paid to the ITA periodically:

| Business size | Reporting frequency | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Small businesses | Bi-monthly | 15th of the month after the period |
| Larger businesses / employers | Monthly | 15th of the following month |

Late reporting and late payment carry penalties and indexation (הצמדה + ריבית).

### 5.2 Mandatory withholder threshold

Not every payer must withhold. A business becomes a mandatory withholding agent for service/asset payments once its turnover crosses the ITA's indexed turnover threshold. Below the threshold, withholding on service payments may not be required, but a business with employees still files Form 102 for payroll.

---

## Section 6 — Annual reconciliation (Form 856)

### 6.1 Purpose

Form 856 (טופס 856) is the annual withholding reconciliation for payments to suppliers and service providers. It is a detailed file listing every payee, the total paid, and the total withheld during the year, reconciled against the Form 102 deposits.

### 6.2 Requirements

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Supplier details | ID/company number, name, address |
| Total payments | Gross amount paid during the year |
| Tax withheld | Amount withheld at source |
| Payment type | Services, goods, rent, commissions, etc. |

### 6.3 Deadline

**April 30** of the year following the reporting year.

### 6.4 Workflow

1. Deposit withheld amounts periodically via Form 102
2. At year end, compile the per-payee detail file
3. Submit Form 856 by April 30
4. Form 856 is the PAYER's obligation as the withholding agent — separate from the payee's own annual return

---

## Section 7 — 2026 deduction-disallowance rule

**Income Tax Circular 3/2026 (effective for payments made from 1.1.2026):**

An expense or input-VAT deduction is disallowed where the payer:
- Failed to withhold tax as required, OR
- Failed to report the withholding as required, OR
- Breached the Law for Reduction of the Use of Cash (cash over NIS 6,000 in a business-to-business transaction)

**Treat a missed withholding or a cash-law breach as a deduction risk, not just a reporting issue.** The business loses the right to deduct the expense for income tax purposes AND loses the right to claim input VAT on the payment.

## Section 8 — Red flags and common errors

| Error | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Using the legacy "20% for services" rate | Under-withholding; payer liable for the shortfall |
| Not checking certificate expiry | Applying a reduced rate when certificate has expired |
| Applying domestic rates to non-resident payments | Under-withholding; potential double taxation issues |
| Using residential rent rate (30%) for commercial property | Should be 35% for commercial |
| Cash payment over NIS 6,000 in B2B | Expense deduction disallowed under 2026 rules |
| Missing Form 102 deadline | Penalties and indexation on late payment |
| Not filing Form 856 by April 30 | Separate annual reconciliation penalty |

---

## Section 9 — Tier 2 items (require professional input)

| Item | Why it needs a professional | What to ask |
|---|---|---|
| Tax treaty application | Treaty rates and documentation requirements vary by country | "Which country is the payee resident in? Provide the treaty article relied on." |
| Withholding on real estate transactions | Complex exemption rules under Mas Rechisha | "Is this a residential or commercial property purchase?" |
| Reclassification of payment type | ITA may challenge the classification | "Provide the service agreement or contract." |
| Exemption claims by non-residents | Requires ITA approval and specific documentation | "Does the non-resident have a permanent establishment in Israel?" |
