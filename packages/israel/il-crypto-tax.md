| Contributor | Open Accountants Community |
| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by Israel-licensed רואה חשבון or יועץ מס |

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether activity is business or investment | Treat as investment (25% capital gains) — flag for professional review if high frequency |
| Staking reward classification unclear | Treat as income at receipt (most conservative) |
| Unknown NIS exchange rate for transaction date | Use most recent Bank of Israel business day rate |
| Crypto received as gift | Use donor's carryover basis (Section 97(a)(5)) |
| Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) | Still an "asset" — every conversion is a taxable disposal |

---

## Section 2 — Legal framework

### 2.1 Core principles

- Cryptocurrency is classified as an **asset** (Neches) under Section 88 of the Income Tax Ordinance (Pekudat Mas Hachnasa — פקודת מס הכנסה), NOT as currency
- Gains are taxed as **capital gains** (Revach Hon) under Chapter E of the Ordinance
- ITA Circular 2018/05 provides primary guidance on crypto taxation
- Every disposal (sale, trade, conversion) is a taxable event valued in NIS
- **Crypto-to-crypto swaps are taxable events** — unlike some jurisdictions, Israel has always treated these as disposals

### 2.2 Business vs investment classification

If crypto activity constitutes a business (Esek — עסק), gains are taxed as ordinary income at marginal rates (up to 50%). Classification depends on:
- Frequency and volume of trading
- Whether taxpayer holds crypto as inventory vs investment
- Time and effort devoted to crypto activity
- Whether the taxpayer has another profession

When in doubt, treat as investment (25%) but flag for professional review.

## Section 3 — FIFO cost basis method

Israel mandates FIFO (First In, First Out) for calculating cost basis unless the taxpayer can demonstrate a different method was consistently applied.

### 3.1 FIFO rules

1. Queue all purchases by date (oldest first)
2. For each sale, match against the oldest available purchase lots
3. Calculate gain/loss for each matched lot: (sale price − purchase price − fees) per unit
4. If a lot is partially consumed, the remainder stays in the queue
5. Sum all gains and losses for the tax year

### 3.2 Currency conversion

- All transactions must be converted to NIS at the Bank of Israel exchange rate (Sha'ar Yatzig — שער יציג) on the transaction date
- For crypto-to-crypto trades, the NIS value of BOTH sides must be determined at the time of trade
- For weekends/holidays when BOI doesn't publish rates, use the most recent business day rate

## Section 4 — DeFi and special income classification

| Activity | Classification | Tax rate | Reporting form |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buy and hold, then sell | Capital gain | 25% | Form 1325 |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap | Capital gain (disposal + acquisition) | 25% | Form 1325 |
| Staking rewards | Income at receipt (conservative); debated | 25–50% | Form 1301 or 1325 |
| Liquidity mining / yield farming | Ordinary income | Marginal rates | Form 1301 |
| Airdrops (free tokens) | Income at receipt, capital gain on subsequent sale | Marginal + 25% | Form 1301 + 1325 |
| Mining | Business income or capital gain (depends on scale) | Variable | Form 1301 or 1325 |
| NFT sales (creator) | Business income | Marginal rates | Form 1301 |
| NFT sales (collector) | Capital gain | 25% | Form 1325 |
| Hard fork tokens | Zero cost basis, capital gain on sale | 25% | Form 1325 |
| Lending interest (CeFi/DeFi) | Interest income | 25% (passive) | Form 1301 |

### Classification notes

- **Staking:** ITA has not issued definitive guidance. Conservative approach treats rewards as income at receipt (market value), then capital gain/loss on subsequent sale
- **Airdrops:** Received tokens are income at market value on receipt date. Cost basis for future sale = market value at receipt
- **Hard forks:** New tokens have zero cost basis; entire sale proceeds are capital gain
- **Stablecoins:** USDT, USDC, DAI are still "asset" under Section 88. Every USDT-to-USDC swap, every conversion leg of a DeFi trade, every off-ramp to fiat is a taxable disposal

---

## Section 5 — Loss offsetting rules

- Capital losses from crypto can offset capital gains from crypto in the same tax year
- Capital losses can offset gains from other assets (stocks, real estate) in the same year
- Capital losses carry forward to offset future capital gains under Section 92 (but cannot offset ordinary income)
- Losses from one spouse can offset gains of the other spouse if filing jointly
- **Israel has no wash-sale rule** — a taxpayer can sell in December at a loss and re-buy in January with the loss fully recognized

---

## Section 6 — Reporting requirements

### 6.1 Annual reporting (Forms 1322 / 1325)

- **Form 1322** (Nispach Gimel — נספח ג) — primary capital gains schedule attached to annual return
- **Form 1325** (Nispach Gimel(1) — נספח ג(1)) — auxiliary detail form for securities/crypto where tax was not withheld at source

For each disposal, report:
1. Asset description (e.g., "Bitcoin (BTC)")
2. Date of acquisition (FIFO-determined)
3. Date of disposal
4. Acquisition cost (NIS)
5. Disposal proceeds (NIS)
6. Capital gain or loss (NIS)
7. Holding period

### 6.2 Advance payment (Form 1399י)

- File within **30 days** of the capital gain event
- Transaction codes: **77** (sale) and **71** (virtual currency)
- Payment: 25% of gain for individuals (30% for significant shareholders)
- Advance payments are credited against annual tax liability
- Penalties for non-payment: interest (Ribit — ריבית) and CPI linkage (Hafreshei Hatzmada — הפרשי הצמדה)

### 6.3 Annual return obligation

Salaried individuals with crypto disposals must file Form 1301 even if they would otherwise be exempt. Any disposal generally triggers a filing obligation.

**Filing deadlines (tax year 2025, filed in 2026):**
- Online: June 30, 2026
- Paper: May 31, 2026
- CPA-represented: extensions available

## Section 7 — Surtax on crypto gains (Mas Yesafim — מס יסף)

From 2026, capital income (including crypto gains) above NIS 721,560 is subject to:
- 3% base surtax on all income above the threshold
- Additional 2% on capital-source income above the same threshold
- **Effective 5% surtax on crypto gains above NIS 721,560**
- Threshold frozen through 2027

---

## Section 8 — Voluntary disclosure (Nohal Gilui Mirtzon — נוהל גילוי מרצון)

The 2025–2026 Voluntary Disclosure Procedure expressly covers digital assets and grants criminal immunity.

| Track | Eligibility | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Green Track | Annual income up to NIS 500,000 and cumulative crypto assets up to NIS 1.5M (as of 31.12.2024) | 31 August 2026 |
| Regular Track | Larger cases | 31 August 2026 |

Anonymity is no longer available — all applications filed with identifying details.

---

## Section 9 — Special rules

### 9.1 Gifts and inheritance

Under Section 97(a)(5), gifts and inheritance use **carryover basis** — the recipient inherits the donor's original cost basis and acquisition date. Treating inherited crypto as zero-basis or fair-market-value at inheritance is incorrect.

### 9.2 Lost crypto

Crypto lost to exchange insolvency (FTX, Celsius pattern), theft, or lost private keys is recognized as a capital loss ONLY when the loss is final and documented (e.g., bankruptcy court order, police report). Do not write off frozen-but-not-bankrupt balances.

### 9.3 Inflation indexation

Section 91(b)(3) splits capital gain into a "real gain" (taxed at 25%) and an "inflation-component gain" (taxed at 0% for individuals on assets acquired after 1.1.1994). For long-held lots, a CPA should perform the manual indexation pass, which reduces effective tax.

## Section 10 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Simple buy and sell

**Scenario:** Bought 0.5 BTC in January 2025 for NIS 80,000, sold in August 2025 for NIS 120,000.

**Working:**
- Capital gain: NIS 120,000 − NIS 80,000 = NIS 40,000
- Tax: NIS 40,000 × 25% = NIS 10,000
- Surtax: total income below NIS 721,560 → no surtax
- Advance payment: Form 1399י within 30 days of August sale → NIS 10,000
- Annual reporting: Forms 1325/1322 with 2025 Form 1301

### Example 2 — Crypto-to-crypto with FIFO

**Scenario:** Bought 2 ETH at NIS 5,000 each (March 2024), 3 ETH at NIS 7,000 each (June 2024). In October, traded 3 ETH for 0.5 BTC when ETH = NIS 9,000.

**Working:**
- FIFO: consume Lot 1 (2 ETH @ NIS 5,000) then 1 ETH from Lot 2 (@ NIS 7,000)
- Lot 1 gain: 2 × (NIS 9,000 − NIS 5,000) = NIS 8,000
- Lot 2 partial gain: 1 × (NIS 9,000 − NIS 7,000) = NIS 2,000
- Total gain: NIS 10,000 → Tax: NIS 2,500
- New BTC cost basis: NIS 27,000 (3 × NIS 9,000)
- Remaining: 2 ETH at NIS 7,000 each

### Example 3 — DeFi staking rewards

**Scenario:** Staked 10 ETH, earned 0.5 ETH in rewards (ETH = NIS 8,000 at receipt). Not sold.

**Working:**
- Conservative: NIS 4,000 taxable income at receipt (0.5 × NIS 8,000)
- Rate: 25% if passive income → NIS 1,000 tax; or marginal rates if ordinary income
- Cost basis for 0.5 reward ETH established at NIS 8,000/ETH
- The 10 staked ETH have not been disposed — no capital gain event on those
- Recommend professional consultation on staking classification

## Section 11 — Common errors

| Error | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Using US capital gains rates (15%/20%) | Israeli rate is 25% for individuals |
| Treating crypto-to-crypto as non-taxable | Always taxable in Israel |
| Using average cost or LIFO | Israel mandates FIFO |
| Ignoring stablecoin conversions | USDT/USDC are assets — every swap is a disposal |
| Treating inherited crypto as zero basis | Carryover basis applies (Section 97(a)(5)) |
| Applying US wash-sale rule | Israel has no wash-sale rule — loss harvesting is valid |
| Missing 30-day advance payment deadline | Interest and linkage penalties accrue |
| Ignoring surtax on crypto gains | 5% additional on capital gains above NIS 721,560 |
