## Skills IL — Tax and Finance

- Repository: [skills-il/tax-and-finance](https://github.com/skills-il/tax-and-finance)
- License: MIT
- Language: Hebrew / English
- Scope: AI agent skills for Israeli tax: payroll calculator, VAT reporting, invoice organizer, withholding tax, pension advisor.
- Why it matters: This is the closest project to the OpenAccountants format for Israel. It provides structured, machine-readable skill files covering the major Israeli tax obligations. Multiple Israel skills in this package were adapted from this project.
- Integration approach:
  - MIT is fully compatible with AGPL-3.0 — content can be incorporated with attribution.
  - Already used as the primary source for freelancer operations, tax withholding, income tax returns, corporate tax strategy, employee tax refunds, cryptocurrency tax reporting, and customs duty skills.
  - Monitor for updates to rates, thresholds, and new skill coverage.

## Income Tax Form 134 Calculator

- Repository: [tomerip/income_tax_t134](https://github.com/tomerip/income_tax_t134)
- License: Apache-2.0
- Language: Hebrew / Python
- Scope: Automates the calculation of Israel Tax Authority Form 134 (טופס 134 — בקשה להקטנת מקדמות), used to request a reduction in advance tax payments (Mikdamot).
- Why it matters: Form 134 is one of the most common freelancer interactions with the ITA. Having an automated calculation reference helps validate Mikdamot reduction logic.
- Integration approach:
  - Apache-2.0 is compatible with AGPL-3.0 — content can be incorporated with attribution.
  - Use as a validation reference for Mikdamot calculation logic in `il-income-tax-returns.md` and `il-freelancer-ops.md`.
  - Cross-check bracket and advance payment formulas against this implementation.

## Tax Forms Generator (Form 1325)

- Repository: [talmiller2/tax_forms_generator](https://github.com/talmiller2/tax_forms_generator)
- License: verify before reuse (14 stars)
- Language: Python / Hebrew
- Scope: Generates Israeli capital gains Form 1325 (דוח רווח הון מניירות ערך) from Interactive Brokers data exports.
- Why it matters: Form 1325 is required for reporting securities capital gains. This project bridges broker data exports to ITA-compatible form output — directly relevant to `il-crypto-tax.md` and capital gains sections of `il-income-tax-returns.md`.
- Integration approach:
  - Treat as reference-only until the license is confirmed as compatible.
  - Reference for Form 1325 field mappings, IB data parsing logic, and NIS conversion methodology.
  - Potential future workflow: OpenAccountants capital gains working papers → Form 1325 output.

- License: verify before reuse (9 stars)
- Language: JavaScript / Hebrew
- Scope: Web-based Israeli tax calculator covering income tax brackets, Nekudot Zikui (credit points), and National Insurance (Bituach Leumi) contributions.
- Why it matters: Provides a quick-reference implementation of bracket calculations and credit point logic that can be used to validate OpenAccountants bracket tables.
- Integration approach:
  - Treat as reference-only until the license is confirmed as compatible.
  - Use as a cross-validation source for income tax bracket boundaries, credit point values, and Bituach Leumi rate tiers.
  - Compare output against `il-income-tax-returns.md` bracket tables for consistency checks.
