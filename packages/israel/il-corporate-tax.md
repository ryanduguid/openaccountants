| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown shareholder percentage | Treat as controlling shareholder (30% dividend tax) |
| Unknown Section 3(tet) rate | Use current year published rate |
| Unknown whether salary is below minimum | Flag minimum salary requirement for controlling shareholders |
| Unknown company type | Treat as closely held (Chevra Me'atim) |

---

## Section 2 — Extraction methods overview

Israeli company owners (Baalei Shlita — בעלי שליטה) have four main methods to extract value:

| Method | Corporate tax | Personal tax | Bituach Leumi | Key advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Salary (Maskoret — משכורת)** | 0% (deductible expense) | Progressive rates (10%–50%) | Employee + Employer NI | Tax credit points, pension deductions, NI ceiling |
| **Dividend (Dividend — דיבידנד)** | 23% (on profit first) | 30% (controlling shareholder) | None | No NI, simple, no employer cost beyond profit |
| **Shareholder loan (Halvaat Baalim — הלוואת בעלים)** | 0% (no immediate tax) | Section 3(tet) deemed interest | None | Defers real tax, keeps cash flexible |
| **Management fees (Dmei Nihul — דמי ניהול)** | 0% (deductible) | Income tax as business income + VAT 18% | Self-employed NI rates | Can deduct business expenses against fees |

### Combined effective tax rates (2026, controlling shareholder above surtax threshold)

| Method | Effective rate (approximate) |
|---|---|
| Salary (top bracket) | ~55–60% (50% income tax + employer NI) |
| Dividend | 46.1% (up to ~52% with surtax) |
| Shareholder loan | 6.53% annual deemed interest (not a real extraction) |
| Management fees | ~50–55% + 18% VAT on gross |

---

## Section 3 — Dividend distribution (Halokat Dividendim — חלוקת דיבידנדים)

### 3.1 Tax calculation for controlling shareholder (10%+ holding)

```
Company pre-tax profit:             P
Corporate tax (23%):                P × 0.23
Distributable profit:               P × 0.77
Dividend withholding tax (30%):     P × 0.77 × 0.30 = P × 0.231
Net to shareholder:                 P × 0.77 × 0.70 = P × 0.539
Effective total tax rate:           46.1%
```

### 3.2 Surtax impact (Mas Yesafim — מס יסף)

If total annual income (including dividend) exceeds NIS 721,560:
- 3% surtax on excess (Section 121B)
- Additional 2% on non-labor income above threshold (effective 2025+)
- Total additional: 5% on dividend portion above threshold
- Effective rate climbs to ~49.95% on portion above threshold

### 3.3 When dividend is optimal

- Shareholder's salary already maximizes lower tax brackets
- Amount is large enough that salary would push into 47%+ bracket
- Company has sufficient retained earnings (Arvei Rvaachim — ערכי רווחים)
- No Bituach Leumi advantage left (salary already above NI ceiling)

### 3.4 When dividend is suboptimal

- Shareholder draws no or low salary (wasting lower brackets and credit points)
- Amount is moderate (under ~NIS 200,000) and salary brackets not fully utilized
- Company needs the cash for operations (dividend is irreversible)

---

## Section 4 — Salary extraction (Maskoret — משכורת)

### 4.1 Income tax brackets (2026)

| Annual income (NIS) | Rate |
|---|---|
| Up to 84,120 | 10% |
| 84,121 – 120,720 | 14% |
| 120,721 – 228,000 | 20% |
| 228,001 – 301,200 | 31% |
| 301,201 – 560,280 | 35% |
| 560,281 – 721,560 | 47% |
| Above 721,560 | 50% (47% + 3% surtax) |

### 4.2 Bituach Leumi for controlling shareholder employees (2026)

| Income range | Employee NI | Employee health | Employer NI |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to NIS 7,703/month | 0.4% | 3.1% | 4.46% |
| NIS 7,703 – NIS 51,910/month | 7.0% | 5.0% | 7.38% |
| Above NIS 51,910/month | 0% (ceiling) | 0% (ceiling) | 0% (ceiling) |

Controlling shareholder NI rates (4.46%/7.38% employer) differ slightly from regular employees (4.51%/7.60%).

### 4.3 Salary advantages

- Pension contributions (Hafrashat Pensia — הפרשת פנסיה) are tax-deductible up to ceiling
- Keren Hishtalmut contributions (up to ceiling) are employer-deductible, tax-free to employee
- Tax credit points reduce effective rate on first brackets
- NI contributions build social security entitlements

### 4.4 Optimal salary level

The sweet spot is often drawing enough salary to utilize the lower tax brackets (up to ~NIS 228,000/year at 20% marginal rate) and maximize pension/Keren Hishtalmut deductions, then extracting additional amounts as dividends.

### 4.5 Minimum salary requirement

The Tax Authority expects controlling shareholders to draw a reasonable salary (~NIS 6,500+/month) before distributing dividends.

## Section 5 — Shareholder loan (Halvaat Baalim — הלוואת בעלים)

### 5.1 Section 3(tet) rules (2026)

When a company lends money to a shareholder at below-market interest:

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Deemed interest rate (2026) | 6.53% per year |
| Treatment for controlling shareholders | Deemed interest classified as salary income, taxed at marginal rates |
| Reporting obligation | Company must report deemed interest on Form 126 |
| Section 3(yod) rate | 4.9% (for CPI-linked loans between related parties) |

### 5.2 Reclassification risks

| Risk factor | Detail |
|---|---|
| Loan not repaid within reasonable time | ITA may reclassify as dividend (30% tax + penalties) |
| Loan used for personal expenses | Strengthens reclassification risk |
| No repayment schedule | Red flag for ITA |
| Company has retained earnings | Increases risk of deemed-dividend reclassification |

### 5.3 Worked example

```
Loan amount:                NIS 500,000
Annual deemed interest:     NIS 500,000 × 6.53% = NIS 32,650
Tax on deemed interest:     NIS 32,650 × 47% (marginal rate) = NIS 15,346
Net annual cost:            NIS 15,346 (3.07% of loan)
```

Compare with dividend on the same NIS 500,000: tax of ~NIS 230,500 (46.1%). The loan defers this but accumulates cost annually.

### 5.4 When shareholder loan makes sense

- Short-term cash need (under 12 months) with clear repayment plan
- Bridge financing until dividend declaration is approved
- Company has a formal loan agreement with interest and repayment terms

### 5.5 When to avoid shareholder loans

- Long-term extraction need (accumulates deemed interest annually)
- Company has distributable retained earnings
- No documented loan agreement or repayment schedule

## Section 6 — Management fees (Dmei Nihul — דמי ניהול)

### 6.1 How it works

1. Shareholder (or their management company) invoices the company for management services
2. Company deducts the fee as a business expense (no corporate tax)
3. Fee is subject to income tax as business income + VAT (18%)
4. If through a personal Osek Murshe: subject to self-employed NI rates

### 6.2 Self-employed NI rates (2026)

| Income range | NI rate | Health rate | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to NIS 7,703/month | 2.87% | 3.1% | 5.97% |
| NIS 7,703 – NIS 51,910/month | 12.83% | 5.0% | 17.83% |

52% of the NI amount is tax-deductible.

### 6.3 Requirements and risks

- Transfer pricing rules apply (Section 85A) — fees must reflect arm's length market rates
- ITA may challenge "excessive" management fees as disguised dividends
- Must issue Heshbonit Mas (tax invoice)
- Requires maintaining a separate business entity with bookkeeping
- Properly documented service agreements required

## Section 7 — Strategy comparison

### 7.1 Decision matrix

| Factor | Salary | Dividend | Loan | Management fees |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total effective tax rate | 10%–60% | 46.1%–52% | 6.53% deemed/year | Variable + 18% VAT |
| Bituach Leumi | Yes (capped) | No | No | Yes (higher rates) |
| Corporate tax deductible | Yes | No | N/A | Yes |
| Pension benefits | Yes | No | No | Self-funded |
| Reversible | No | No | Yes (repay loan) | No |
| ITA scrutiny | Low | Low | High | Medium |
| Timing flexibility | Monthly | Board resolution | Immediate | Per invoice |

### 7.2 Common optimal combinations

| Scenario | Recommended approach |
|---|---|
| Small extraction (under NIS 200,000) | Salary up to the 20% bracket to maximize credit points and pension |
| Medium extraction (NIS 200,000 – 500,000) | Salary to optimize brackets + dividend for the remainder |
| Large extraction (NIS 500,000+) | Salary at optimal level + dividend; potentially short-term loan bridge |
| One-time tax assessment | Short-term shareholder loan with 12-month repayment, funded by planned dividend |

## Section 8 — Closely held companies (Chevra Me'atim — חברה מעטים)

A closely held company is subject to a 2% annual tax on accumulated undistributed profits unless at least 6% of accumulated profits are distributed as dividends.

This rule creates pressure to distribute regularly rather than accumulating profits indefinitely within the company.

---

## Section 9 — Compliance checklist

| Requirement | Check |
|---|---|
| Company has a CPA (Roe Cheshbon — רואה חשבון) | All strategies require professional filing |
| Board resolution for dividends | Required before distribution, must be documented |
| Loan agreement for shareholder loans | Written agreement with interest rate, repayment schedule, and signatures |
| Minimum salary for controlling shareholder | ITA expects ~NIS 6,500+/month before dividends |
| Withholding tax on dividends | Company must withhold 30% and deposit with ITA by the 15th of the following month |
