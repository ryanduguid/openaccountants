## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement or record of gross sales/receipts for the year, TIN (Tax Identification Number), and confirmation of whether 8% flat rate or graduated rates are elected.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices/official receipts, purchase records, BIR Form 2307 certificates of withholding, prior year ITR (Form 1701/1701A), BIR registration (Form 2303 / Certificate of Registration).

**Ideal** -- complete books of accounts, general ledger, trial balance, quarterly ITRs (Form 1701Q), percentage tax returns (Form 2551Q), VAT returns (Form 2550Q) if applicable.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-PH-1 -- Corporation or partnership.** "This skill covers sole proprietors and individual professionals only. Corporations file Form 1702. Escalate to a CPA."

**R-PH-2 -- VAT-registered taxpayer.** "VAT-registered taxpayers have additional obligations (Form 2550Q/2550M) and cannot use the 8% flat rate option. Income tax still applies but filing differs."

**R-PH-3 -- Mixed income earner (employment + business).** "Mixed income earners can use the 8% option only on business income, while employment income is taxed at graduated rates. Requires careful computation."

**R-PH-4 -- Non-resident alien.** "Non-resident aliens have different rules (NRA-ETB or NRA-NETB). Out of scope."

## Section 3 -- Two Tax Options for Self-Employed

### 3.1 Option 1: Graduated Income Tax

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Gross sales/receipts | Total business revenue |
| Less: Cost of sales/services | Direct costs |
| = Gross income | |
| Less: Deductions (itemized OR OSD) | |
| = Net taxable income | Apply graduated rates |

**Deduction methods:**

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| Itemized deductions | Actual business expenses with supporting documentation (receipts, invoices, BIR-registered) |
| OSD (Optional Standard Deduction) | 40% of gross sales/receipts (no documentation required) |

If graduated rates are elected, the taxpayer is ALSO subject to **3% Percentage Tax** (quarterly, Form 2551Q) on gross sales/receipts, unless VAT-registered (12% VAT instead).

### 3.2 Option 2: 8% Flat Rate

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| Gross sales/receipts + other non-operating income | Total |
| Less: ₱250,000 (if purely self-employed) | Exempt threshold |
| × 8% | Tax due |

No deductions allowed. No percentage tax due.

### 3.3 When to Choose 8% vs Graduated

| Scenario | Better Option |
|---|---|
| Low expenses relative to revenue | 8% flat rate |
| High expenses (>60% of gross) | Graduated with itemized deductions |
| Moderate expenses, wants simplicity | 8% flat rate |
| Gross exceeds ₱3,000,000 | Must use graduated (8% not available) |
| VAT-registered | Must use graduated |

### 3.4 Election Procedure

| Action | Detail |
|---|---|
| New registration | Check 8% option on BIR Form 1901 |
| Existing taxpayer switching | File BIR Form 1905 before first quarter, OR indicate on first Q1 filing (Form 1701Q) |
| Annual renewal | Must elect every year; does not carry over automatically |
| Exceeding ₱3M threshold | Must switch to graduated + 12% VAT from the month threshold is exceeded |

## Section 6 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- 8% Flat Rate

**Input:** Freelance graphic designer. Gross receipts ₱2,400,000. No employees.

**Tax:** (₱2,400,000 - ₱250,000) × 8% = ₱172,000. No percentage tax. No documentation of expenses required.

### Example 2 -- Graduated with OSD

**Input:** Same freelancer, ₱2,400,000 gross.

**OSD:** 40% × ₱2,400,000 = ₱960,000.
**Net taxable income:** ₱2,400,000 - ₱960,000 = ₱1,440,000.
**Tax:** ₱102,500 + (₱1,440,000 - ₱800,000) × 25% = ₱102,500 + ₱160,000 = ₱262,500.
**Plus 3% percentage tax:** ₱2,400,000 × 3% = ₱72,000.
**Total tax burden:** ₱262,500 + ₱72,000 = ₱334,500.

**Comparison:** 8% flat rate (₱172,000) is significantly better for this taxpayer.

### Example 3 -- Graduated with Itemized Deductions

**Input:** Consultant, gross receipts ₱2,400,000, documented expenses ₱1,800,000.

**Net taxable income:** ₱2,400,000 - ₱1,800,000 = ₱600,000.
**Tax:** ₱22,500 + (₱600,000 - ₱400,000) × 20% = ₱22,500 + ₱40,000 = ₱62,500.
**Plus 3% percentage tax:** ₱72,000.
**Total:** ₱134,500. Better than 8% due to high expenses.
