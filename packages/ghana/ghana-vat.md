GHS 10,000 net. VAT GHS 1,500 + NHIL GHS 250 + GETFund GHS 250 = total GHS 2,000 (20%).

### Example 2 -- Withholding VAT

Government ministry pays supplier. Invoice GHS 20K + VAT 3K + NHIL 500 + GETFund 500 = GHS 24K. Withholding = 7% of GHS 3K = GHS 210. Supplier receives GHS 23,790. Claims GHS 210 credit (Box 20).

## Section 5 -- Classification rules

- **Levy stacking on same base** — 15% VAT + 2.5% NHIL + 2.5% GETFund on same base. Under Act 1151, all three recoverable as input.  _(Act 1151)_
- **Zero rate categories** — 0% percent (exports, Free Zones)  _(Act 1151)_
- **Exempt categories** — Exempt: financial (margin-based), residential rental, medical, education, unprocessed foodstuffs, agricultural inputs, petroleum (separate levies).  _(Act 1151)_

- **Withholding VAT rate** — 7% percent (of VAT amount, not total invoice; agents withhold only on VAT, not NHIL/GETFund; supplier claims credit Box 20)

## Section 8 -- Deductibility and blocked input

- **NHIL/GETFund recoverability under Act 1151** — Under Act 1151: NHIL and GETFund on inputs ARE recoverable.  _(Act 1151)_
