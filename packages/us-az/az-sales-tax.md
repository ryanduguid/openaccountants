### EC1 -- Prime contracting

**Situation:** Contractor builds a house.
**Resolution:** Prime contracting classification. 65% of contract price treated as real property improvement (not taxable); 35% treated as materials (taxable at TPT rate). Complex -- escalate.

### Test 1 -- Retail sale in Phoenix

**Input:** $500 item. Combined rate: ~8.6%.
**Expected:** Tax = ~$43.

### Test 2 -- Grocery food exempt

**Input:** $200 groceries.
**Expected:** Tax = $0. Grocery food exempt in AZ.

## Section 10 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER call Arizona's tax a "sales tax" without noting it is a Transaction Privilege Tax on the SELLER.
- NEVER forget that city TPT rates and exemptions can differ from the state.
- NEVER apply destination-based sourcing for most TPT classifications -- Arizona is generally origin-based.
- NEVER treat grocery food as taxable -- it is exempt in Arizona.
- NEVER compute any number -- all arithmetic is handled by the deterministic engine, not Claude.
