# Arizona Transaction Privilege Tax (TPT)

Arizona TPT under A.R.S. §42-5001 et seq. is a tax on the seller's privilege of doing business in Arizona, not on the buyer — fundamentally different from a typical state sales tax. The seller is liable regardless of whether the tax is collected from the customer. Sixteen distinct business classifications each have their own rate and base. State rate is 5.6%, plus county (0.5%-1.1%) and city (up to ~4%), producing combined rates of approximately 7%-11.2%. Prime Contracting uses a 65% modified base. Marketplace facilitators collect since October 2019 ($100k threshold). All 91 Arizona cities are now collected by ADOR via Form TPT-2 (monthly, quarterly, or annual). Tax year 2025.

---

## 1. Scope and Refusals

### 1.1 In scope

- Determining whether a business activity is taxable under one or more of the sixteen TPT classifications in A.R.S. §42-5061 through §42-5076.
- Computing TPT due across the state, county, and city layers using ADOR's TPT-2 form.
- Use Tax under A.R.S. §42-5155 on out-of-state purchases brought into Arizona for storage, use, or consumption.
- Sourcing rules post-Wayfair (destination-based, A.R.S. §42-5040).
- Marketplace facilitator collection obligations under A.R.S. §42-5043 (effective 1 October 2019).
- Remote-seller economic nexus under A.R.S. §42-5044 (the $100,000 gross-receipts threshold).
- Form TPT-2 filing frequencies, due dates, and the 20th-of-month rule.
- Resale exemption certificate (Form 5000) and standard exemption certificates (Form 5000A series).
- The Prime Contracting classification's unique 65% modified base.
- City-level TPT collected through ADOR for all 91 Arizona incorporated cities and towns.

### 1.2 Out of scope (refer out)

- **Speculative builder tax** (municipal-only, A.R.S. §42-6004 partially-codified, primarily Model City Tax Code §§416-417) — refer to municipal counsel.
- **Contractor's use tax / owner-builder** — overlaps with Prime Contracting but is a separate municipal regime; refer to the city tax office.
- **Property tax** (A.R.S. Title 42 Ch. 11-19) — distinct local levy on real and personal property.
- **Vehicle Use Tax (VUT)** on out-of-state vehicle purchases — administered by ADOT/MVD, not ADOR TPT.
- **Mining severance** (Class 13, A.R.S. §42-5072) and **Telecommunications Service Excise Tax / 911 surcharge** — separately administered.
- **Arizona income tax** (A.R.S. Title 43, 2.5% flat as of 2023) — separate regime; this skill addresses only TPT/use tax.
- **TPT audits, voluntary disclosure, and protests** — credentialed Arizona tax counsel only.
- **Tribal lands and reservation activity** — federal preemption analysis required; refer out.

### 1.3 Refusal catalogue (TPT-specific)

- **R-AZ-TPT-1:** Refuse to determine taxability of a Prime Contracting / MRRA (Maintenance, Repair, Replacement, Alteration) split without seeing the actual contract scope and a project-by-project breakdown. The MRRA carve-out under A.R.S. §42-5075(B)(7) is fact-intensive.
- **R-AZ-TPT-2:** Refuse to opine on tribal-land activity or sales to enrolled tribal members on reservations. McClanahan / Bracker preemption analysis is out of scope.
- **R-AZ-TPT-3:** Refuse to compute the Mining (Class 13) severance tax without a metallurgical assay and the producer's audited gross value of production.
- **R-AZ-TPT-4:** Refuse to issue an opinion on the "computer software as TPP vs service" question for custom-developed software without seeing the SOW; ADOR's position has shifted multiple times and a Private Taxpayer Ruling (PTR) is the only safe path.
- **R-AZ-TPT-5:** Refuse to determine nexus on marketplace facilitator vs marketplace seller treatment without confirmation of which party holds the TPT license and reports the gross income.
- **R-AZ-TPT-6:** Refuse to advise on speculative builder tax — that is municipal, not state TPT, and varies materially by city.

## 2. TPT vs. Sales Tax — The Legal Distinction

This is the single most important conceptual point and the most common source of error among out-of-state practitioners.

### 2.1 Statutory character

A.R.S. §42-5008(A): *"There is levied and shall be collected by the department for the purpose of raising public money to be used in liquidating the outstanding obligations of the state … privilege taxes measured by the amount or volume of business transacted by persons on account of their business activities."*

The tax is on the **privilege of engaging in business** in Arizona. The **seller is the taxpayer**. The buyer is not a taxpayer under the TPT statute. Compare this with virtually every other state's retail sales tax (e.g., California R&TC §6051, New York Tax Law §1105), where the buyer is the statutory taxpayer and the seller is merely a collection agent acting as a trustee for the state.

### 2.2 Consequences of the distinction

| Issue | True sales tax (e.g., CA, NY) | Arizona TPT |
|---|---|---|
| Statutory taxpayer | Buyer | Seller |
| Effect of failure to collect from customer | Buyer still owes tax; seller has trustee liability if collected | Seller is liable to ADOR regardless of whether seller charged the customer |
| Can the seller absorb the tax? | Generally prohibited (anti-absorption statutes) | Yes — seller may absorb TPT and not pass it on to the customer |
| Is the tax on the invoice "tax"? | Yes — held in trust for the state | A pass-through reimbursement of the seller's own privilege-tax expense |
| Buyer's tax base | Pre-tax sales price | Includes any TPT the seller passes through (technically — though ADOR allows "tax on tax" carve-outs by classification) |
| Discharge in bankruptcy | Trust-fund tax — non-dischargeable | TPT is an income/excise tax of the seller — dischargeability analysis differs |

### 2.3 Practical implication for accountants

When you "charge TPT to the customer" on an Arizona invoice you are not collecting a tax the customer owes. You are reimbursing yourself for a tax **you the seller** owe Arizona on the privilege of having made that sale. If the customer refuses to pay the line-item, **you still owe Arizona the tax**. This is why the AZ TPT line on an invoice is often shown as part of "gross receipts" rather than as a separately-stated tax in some classifications.

### 2.4 Why this matters for the bookkeeper

- The TPT remitted to ADOR is an **operating expense** of the seller (deductible on the federal Schedule C as a business tax) — not a balance-sheet pass-through clearing account in the strict economic sense, although it is commonly bookkept that way for convenience.
- An out-of-state seller who registers in Arizona is registering **themselves as the taxpayer** — not as a trustee. This affects the analysis under multistate apportionment and under the Multistate Tax Compact.
- The seller's gross receipts for federal income-tax purposes include TPT collected from customers (because the TPT is the seller's own tax). Many CPAs miss this and net the TPT against revenue, mis-stating gross receipts on Schedule C / Form 1120.

---

## 3. The Sixteen Classifications

Each business activity in Arizona must be slotted into one of the sixteen statutory classifications. A single business may straddle multiple classifications and must report each separately on Form TPT-2.

### 3.1 Rates by classification (state rate only; county and city stack on top)

| # | Classification | A.R.S. § | State rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Transporting | §42-5062 | 5.6% | Persons or property for hire intrastate |
| 2 | Utilities | §42-5063 | 5.6% | Electric, gas, water |
| 3 | Telecommunications | §42-5064 | 5.5% | Plus 911 excise (separate) |
| 4 | Private Car / Pullman | §42-5065 | 5.6% | Rail-car private lines |
| 5 | Pipeline | §42-5066 | 5.6% | Oil/gas pipeline operators |
| 6 | Publication | §42-5067 | 5.6% | Newspapers, magazines |
| 7 | Job Printing | §42-5068 | 5.6% | Commercial printing |
| 8 | Restaurant | §42-5074 | 5.6% | Prepared food and drink |
| 9 | Amusement | §42-5073 | 5.6% | Admissions, recreation, sports |
| 10 | Personal Property Rental | §42-5071 | 5.6% | TPP leasing |
| 11 | Mining — Severance (Metalliferous) | §42-5072 | 3.125% | Copper, gold, silver |
| 12 | Prime Contracting | §42-5075 | 5.6% on **65% of gross** | See Section 4 |
| 13 | Owner-Builder Sales | §42-5076 | Varies | Limited; mostly municipal |
| 14 | Hotel / Transient Lodging | §42-5070 | 5.5% | Plus 1% additional bed tax under §42-5070(C) |
| 15 | Retail | §42-5061 | 5.6% | The catch-all for TPP sales |
| 16 | Use Tax | §42-5155 | 5.6% | Complement to Retail on imports |

(Statutory numbering and ordering follows the ADOR Form TPT-2 instructions; the historical numbering in §42-5061 et seq. is not strictly sequential.)

### 3.2 County rates

The fifteen Arizona counties layer their own TPT (Title 42 Ch. 6 Art. 3, A.R.S. §42-6103 et seq.). Approximate ranges for tax year 2025:

| County | County TPT rate |
|---|---|
| Maricopa | 0.7% |
| Pima | 0.5% |
| Pinal | 1.1% (reduced after Vangilder v. ADOR, 252 Ariz. 481 (2022)) |
| Yavapai | 0.75% |
| Mohave | 0.25% |
| Coconino | 1.3% (Flagstaff area combined effective rate elevated) |
| Yuma | 1.112% |
| Cochise | 0.5% |
| Navajo | 0.5% |
| Apache | 0.5% |
| Gila | 1.0% |
| Graham | 1.0% |
| Greenlee | 0.5% |
| La Paz | 2.0% |
| Santa Cruz | 0.5% |

(Verify against ADOR Publication 610 for the period you are filing.)

### 3.3 City rates — illustrative combined examples

| City | City TPT | Combined (state + county + city) |
|---|---|---|
| Phoenix | 2.3% | ~8.6% |
| Scottsdale | 1.75% | ~8.05% |
| Tucson | 2.6% | ~8.7% |
| Mesa | 2.0% | ~8.3% |
| Tempe | 1.8% | ~8.1% |
| Chandler | 1.5% | ~7.8% |
| Glendale | 2.9% | ~9.2% |
| Flagstaff | 2.281% | ~9.18% |
| Sedona | 3.5% | ~10.55% |
| Yuma | 1.7% | ~8.41% |
| Bullhead City | 2.0% | ~7.85% |

(Always verify against the **TPT Rate Tables** published by ADOR each month — rates change frequently, especially after bond elections.)

---

## 4. Prime Contracting — The 65% Modified Base

This classification is unique in American sub-national tax law and is the single largest source of compliance error.

### 4.1 Who is a Prime Contractor

A.R.S. §42-5075(A): the tax applies to the **gross proceeds of sales** or **gross income** of a "prime contractor" engaged in the business of **contracting**. A "prime contractor" under §42-5075(R)(11) is the contractor who is responsible to the property owner for the completion of the project. Subcontractors generally do **not** owe TPT on their portion when their prime contractor has provided them with a Form 5005 certificate.

### 4.2 The 65% base

A.R.S. §42-5075(B): the tax base is **65% of the gross proceeds of sales or gross income** derived from the contracting activity. The remaining 35% is presumed to represent labor and is not subject to TPT at the contracting layer.

Effective TPT rate on prime contracting:

- State: 5.6% × 65% = **3.64% effective**
- County (Maricopa example): 0.7% × 65% = 0.455% effective
- City (Phoenix example): 2.3% × 65% = 1.495% effective
- **Combined effective rate (Phoenix prime): ≈ 5.59%** of gross contract.

### 4.3 What is "contracting"?

Per §42-5075(R)(3): "contracting" means engaging in business as a contractor. A "contractor" is a person engaged in business who undertakes to or offers to undertake to, or purports to have the capacity to undertake to, or submits a bid to, or does himself or by or through others, **construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, excavation or other structure, project, development or improvement to real property**.

### 4.4 The MRRA carve-out

A.R.S. §42-5075(B)(7) (added by Laws 2013 Ch. 255 and refined by Laws 2014 Ch. 263, effective 1 January 2015) excludes "maintenance, repair, replacement or alteration" (MRRA) of existing property from Prime Contracting. MRRA is instead taxed at the **Retail** classification at the **materials level** — the contractor pays Retail TPT to the material supplier and does **not** charge Prime Contracting TPT to the customer.

The distinction is fact-intensive:

| Activity | Classification | Tax base |
|---|---|---|
| New construction | Prime Contracting | 65% of contract |
| Substantial expansion | Prime Contracting | 65% of contract |
| Replacing a roof | MRRA (Retail at supplier) | Materials cost |
| Remodeling a bathroom | MRRA (Retail at supplier) | Materials cost |
| Building an addition | Prime Contracting | 65% of contract |
| Re-paving a parking lot | MRRA (Retail at supplier) | Materials cost |
| Tearing down and rebuilding | Prime Contracting | 65% of contract |
| Painting (only) | MRRA | Materials cost |

A single contract often contains both — for example, a remodel that includes building an addition. The contractor must **split the contract** and apply both regimes. ADOR's Publication 542 (Contracting and the Transaction Privilege Tax) sets out the bifurcation methodology.

### 4.5 Subcontractor exemption — Form 5005

A subcontractor receiving a Form 5005 from a prime is exempt from Prime Contracting TPT on that subcontract under §42-5075(D). The prime is the taxable party. If the prime fails to issue Form 5005, the subcontractor is jointly liable.

### 4.6 Common error: invoicing TPT as a line item

Because TPT is the seller's tax, contractors often gross-up their bid to include TPT. If the contract says "$100,000 plus TPT," the gross income is **$100,000** (or arguably $100,000 grossed-up to cover the TPT itself — a "tax on tax" question). ADOR allows the contractor to compute TPT on the contract price exclusive of the TPT line if the contract clearly separately states the TPT — this is the "factored rate" calculation in ADOR Publication 612.

---

## 5. Sourcing (post-Wayfair)

### 5.1 Destination sourcing

A.R.S. §42-5040 (as amended by Laws 2019 Ch. 273): retail sales are sourced to the **destination** — the location where the buyer takes possession or to which delivery is made.

- In-store pickup → store location.
- Delivered to buyer's Arizona address → buyer's Arizona address.
- Drop-shipment from out-of-state directly to Arizona buyer → Arizona destination (potential nexus issue for the drop-shipper).

### 5.2 Nexus — three flavours

1. **Physical nexus** (pre-Wayfair): inventory, employee, office, contractor in Arizona.
2. **Economic nexus** (A.R.S. §42-5044, eff. 1 Oct 2019): gross sales into Arizona exceeding **$100,000** in the current or prior calendar year. (Arizona originally had a step-down schedule of $200k → $150k → $100k; the threshold settled at $100,000 from 2021 forward.)
3. **Marketplace facilitator nexus** (A.R.S. §42-5043, eff. 1 Oct 2019): the facilitator (Amazon, eBay, Etsy, Walmart Marketplace) collects on behalf of third-party sellers.

### 5.3 Click-through and affiliate nexus

Arizona does not have a separate click-through nexus statute analogous to New York Tax Law §1101(b)(8)(vi) — economic nexus supersedes.

---

## 6. Marketplace Facilitators

### 6.1 Statutory framework

A.R.S. §42-5043 imposes the TPT collection obligation on a "marketplace facilitator" — defined as a person that contracts with marketplace sellers to facilitate retail sales by:

1. Listing or advertising the seller's product, AND
2. Collecting payment from the buyer and transmitting it to the seller.

### 6.2 What the marketplace seller does (or does not do)

If 100% of a seller's Arizona sales flow through a marketplace facilitator (Amazon, Etsy, eBay) that is reporting and remitting TPT, the seller:

- Does **not** need to register for TPT in Arizona on those sales.
- **Should still maintain documentation** that the facilitator collected and remitted on each transaction.
- **Must register** for any direct sales channel (Shopify, own website, in-person at a trade show) that crosses the $100k threshold or that has physical nexus.

### 6.3 Marketplace seller registration when also selling direct

The most common situation: a small seller sells on Amazon (facilitator collects) **and** their own Shopify store. The Shopify channel must register separately. The seller does **not** include marketplace-facilitated gross receipts on Form TPT-2 (the facilitator reports those on its own TPT-2 under its own license).

### 6.4 Pitfall — Amazon FBA inventory in Arizona

Inventory stored in an Amazon fulfillment center in Phoenix (PHX3, PHX5, PHX6, PHX7) creates **physical nexus** even if Amazon is collecting and remitting the TPT. The seller still has a **TPT registration** obligation for the privilege of having inventory in the state, and may need to file a $0 / marketplace-only return depending on facts. Confirm with ADOR Publication 622.

---

## 7. Cities and the ADOR Consolidation

### 7.1 Historical background

Until 1 January 2017, Arizona had a bifurcated collection system: ADOR collected state and county TPT; many cities collected their own. The eighteen largest cities were "non-program cities" or "self-collecting" — Apache Junction, Avondale, Bullhead City, Chandler, Douglas, Flagstaff, Glendale, Mesa, Nogales, Peoria, Phoenix, Prescott, Scottsdale, Sedona, Somerton, Tempe, Tucson, and Willcox.

### 7.2 HB 2280 (Laws 2013 Ch. 255) and consolidation

HB 2280 mandated single-point collection through ADOR. After phased implementation and litigation, **as of 1 January 2017** all 91 incorporated Arizona cities and towns are collected through ADOR. The Form TPT-2 has a region code field for each city, and ADOR distributes the collected revenue back to the city.

### 7.3 Current state (2025)

All 91 cities use ADOR for collection. Each retains:

- Its own city tax code (the **Model City Tax Code** under A.R.S. §42-6051) with classification-by-classification deviations from state TPT.
- Its own **audit authority** — a city may still audit you even though ADOR collects.
- Its own **license fee** (typically $2-$50 per location per year).

A taxpayer with locations in multiple cities pays:

- One state TPT registration fee ($12).
- One license fee per city per location.
- Files one combined TPT-2 covering all jurisdictions.

### 7.4 Region codes on Form TPT-2

Each line of TPT-2 requires a **region code** (e.g., PHX for Phoenix, TUC for Tucson, SCT for Scottsdale) and a **business code** matching the classification. Mis-coding the region produces an underpayment to one city and an overpayment to another — ADOR's matching of bank deposits to city allocations depends on accurate coding.

---

## 8. Filing — Form TPT-2

### 8.1 Frequency thresholds (A.R.S. §42-5014)

| Annual TPT liability | Filing frequency |
|---|---|
| More than $1,000,000 | Monthly, plus prepayment (June) |
| $8,000 - $1,000,000 | Monthly |
| $2,000 - $8,000 | Quarterly |
| Less than $2,000 | Annually |

ADOR may reassign a taxpayer's frequency after a year of data.

### 8.2 Due dates

- Monthly: 20th of the month following the period (e.g., January TPT due February 20).
- Quarterly: 20th of the month following quarter end (April 20, July 20, October 20, January 20).
- Annual: January 20 of the following year.
- Electronic filers receive an extra five business days to file; payment is still due on the 20th.

### 8.3 June prepayment for very large filers

A.R.S. §42-5014(D): taxpayers whose prior-year TPT exceeded $1,000,000 must remit an estimated payment for June activity by **June 30**, then reconcile on the July TPT-2 due August 20.

### 8.4 Electronic filing mandate

A.R.S. §42-5014(F): taxpayers whose annual TPT liability exceeds $500 must file and pay electronically through **AZTaxes.gov**. Paper TPT-2 is permissible only for very small filers and is strongly discouraged.

### 8.5 Discount for timely filing

A.R.S. §42-5017: a **1% discount** (capped at $10,000 per calendar year) is allowed for timely filing and payment of state TPT. The discount does **not** apply to county or city TPT.

### 8.6 Penalties

- Late filing: 4.5% per month, up to 25%.
- Late payment: 0.5% per month, up to 10%.
- Combined cap: 25%.
- Interest: federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points, per A.R.S. §42-1123.

### 8.7 Amended returns

File a corrected Form TPT-2 for the period; mark "amended." Statute of limitations under A.R.S. §42-1104 is generally **four years** from the due date.

---

## 9. Use Tax (A.R.S. §42-5155)

### 9.1 Statutory complement

Use Tax is imposed on the storage, use, or consumption in Arizona of TPP purchased from a retailer at a rate equal to the Retail TPT rate (5.6% state). Its purpose is to prevent Arizona residents and businesses from avoiding TPT by buying out-of-state.

### 9.2 Who owes it

- Arizona businesses that purchase TPP from out-of-state vendors who do **not** charge Arizona TPT.
- Arizona consumers (but consumer-level use tax compliance is famously low; ADOR primarily enforces through business audit).

### 9.3 Credit for tax paid to another state

A.R.S. §42-5159(A)(7): credit is allowed for sales/use tax legally due to and paid in another state, up to the Arizona rate.

### 9.4 Reporting

Use Tax is reported on the **same Form TPT-2** under a separate business class code (Code 029). A business that has no TPT activity but owes Use Tax still files TPT-2.

### 9.5 Common audit area

Out-of-state SaaS, downloaded software, office equipment shipped from Texas with no AZ TPT charged, and contractor equipment brought across the state line — these are the most common Use Tax audit issues.

---

## 10. Resale Certificate — Form 5000

### 10.1 Purpose

A retailer purchasing TPP for resale to a customer is not liable for TPT on that purchase. The purchaser furnishes the supplier with a **Form 5000 (Transaction Privilege Tax Exemption Certificate)** asserting the exemption.

### 10.2 Form 5000 variants

- **Form 5000** — general exemption certificate.
- **Form 5000A** — purchases for resale.
- **Form 5000HC** — health care purchases.
- **Form 5005** — prime contractor's certificate to subcontractor.

### 10.3 Required fields

- Buyer's TPT license number.
- Buyer's business name and address.
- Reason for exemption (statutory citation).
- Single-purchase or blanket certificate (blanket is valid for the period stated, typically up to 4 years).
- Signature.

### 10.4 Seller's good-faith reliance

A.R.S. §42-5009(B): the seller is relieved of TPT liability if it received a properly-completed Form 5000 in good faith. Bad faith (e.g., the seller knew the buyer was the end user) revives liability.

---

## 11. Common Errors — The "It's Just Sales Tax" Trap

The following errors recur in practice when out-of-state CPAs treat AZ TPT as a sales tax.

| Error | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Netting TPT against revenue on Schedule C | Understates federal gross receipts; reconciliation problems with 1099-K. |
| Assuming buyer is the taxpayer | Failing to register because "the customer pays the tax" — leaves seller exposed. |
| Treating MRRA work as Prime Contracting (or vice versa) | Wrong base, wrong rate, wrong supplier exemption. |
| Treating subcontractor income as taxable when Form 5005 was issued | Double tax. |
| Failing to register after $100k economic nexus crossed | Liability accrues from the date of crossing the threshold, not from date of discovery. |
| Treating Amazon FBA inventory as not creating nexus because Amazon collects | Storage is physical nexus; seller still must register. |
| Coding a Phoenix sale to the wrong region code | City allocation is wrong; ADOR audit flag. |
| Forgetting that Use Tax shares a TPT-2 line | Out-of-state purchases go unreported. |
| Not separately stating TPT on a contract | Tax-on-tax exposure. |
| Treating tribal-land sales as plain TPT | Federal preemption may apply; refer out. |
| Confusing the 1% timely-filing discount with a cap on city TPT | Discount is state-only and capped at $10k/year. |
| Filing on the 25th because "that's the sales-tax deadline" | AZ is the 20th, not the 25th. |

---

## 12. Worked Examples

### 12.1 Example A — Phoenix-based SaaS reseller

**Facts.** A Phoenix LLC sells a third-party SaaS subscription to small businesses. In 2025 it had $480,000 of gross receipts: $360,000 from Arizona customers (of which $200,000 were Phoenix-based), $120,000 from out-of-state customers.

**Classification analysis.**

- SaaS in Arizona is historically a thorny issue. ADOR has taken the position (ATR 23-001 and predecessor TPRs) that **prewritten computer software accessed remotely** is taxable under the Personal Property Rental classification (A.R.S. §42-5071) on the theory that the software vendor is granting the customer a license to use TPP. Custom-developed software accessed remotely is generally not taxable. The position has shifted multiple times — a Private Taxpayer Ruling is the safer path for a marginal case.
- Assume here that the resale of the SaaS subscription falls within the Retail or Personal Property Rental classification (treat as Retail for illustration; the rate is the same — 5.6%).

**Sourcing.**

- $360,000 Arizona-sourced (destination): taxable.
- $120,000 out-of-state: not subject to AZ TPT (sourcing fails). The destination-state nexus must be analyzed separately.

**Tax computation (Phoenix combined ≈ 8.6%):**

- Of the $360,000 AZ-sourced, $200,000 is Phoenix-destination, $160,000 is elsewhere in Arizona (assume Tempe at ~8.1% for illustration).

| Layer | Rate | Base ($200k Phx) | Tax | Base ($160k Tempe) | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| State | 5.6% | $200,000 | $11,200 | $160,000 | $8,960 |
| Maricopa County | 0.7% | $200,000 | $1,400 | $160,000 | $1,120 |
| Phoenix | 2.3% | $200,000 | $4,600 | — | — |
| Tempe | 1.8% | — | — | $160,000 | $2,880 |
| **Total TPT** | | | **$17,200** | | **$12,960** |

Total TPT due: **$30,160**, less 1% state-level timely discount: $20,160 × 1% = $201.60 ≈ $202 discount. (Discount applies only to state portion: $11,200 + $8,960 = $20,160 × 1% = $201.60.)

**Filing frequency.** $30,160 annual liability → monthly filing.

**Bookkeeping caution.** Federal gross receipts on Schedule C = $480,000, **including** any TPT that was passed through to customers (because TPT is the seller's own tax). Do not net.

### 12.2 Example B — Arizona prime contractor doing a residential remodel + addition

**Facts.** A Scottsdale general contractor signs a $300,000 fixed-price contract with a homeowner to (a) remodel the existing kitchen and master bathroom ($180,000 attributable), and (b) build a new 600 sq ft addition ($120,000 attributable). The contractor sources materials from a local supplier in Scottsdale.

**Classification analysis.**

- The **remodel of existing space** ($180,000) is **MRRA** under A.R.S. §42-5075(B)(7). The contractor pays **Retail TPT to the supplier** on materials and does **not** charge Prime Contracting TPT to the homeowner on this $180,000.
- The **new addition** ($120,000) is **Prime Contracting** because it is new construction adding to the structure. Tax base = 65% × $120,000 = $78,000.

**Tax computation on the addition (Prime Contracting, Scottsdale combined ≈ 8.05%):**

| Layer | Rate | Base | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| State | 5.6% | $78,000 | $4,368 |
| Maricopa County | 0.7% | $78,000 | $546 |
| Scottsdale | 1.75% | $78,000 | $1,365 |
| **Total Prime TPT** | | | **$6,279** |

**Effective rate on the addition:** $6,279 / $120,000 = **5.23%**.

**MRRA portion** — materials cost (say $80,000 of materials within the $180,000 remodel scope). Supplier charges Retail TPT at Scottsdale ~8.05% = $6,440. The contractor pays this to the supplier; it is part of the contractor's cost of goods sold, not a separate TPT remittance.

**Total TPT impact on project:** $6,279 (Prime) + $6,440 (Retail at supplier on MRRA materials) = $12,719.

**Pitfall.** If the contractor incorrectly treats the entire $300,000 as Prime Contracting, base = 65% × $300,000 = $195,000, tax ≈ $15,700. The contractor over-pays by ~$3,000 and the homeowner is over-billed. The supplier still charged Retail TPT on the MRRA materials, so the contractor has effectively double-paid.

**Subcontractor handling.** If a plumber works on the addition under a $20,000 subcontract, the prime contractor must issue Form 5005 to the plumber. The plumber excludes the $20,000 from its own Prime Contracting taxable base; the prime keeps the $20,000 inside its own 65% base.

### 12.3 Example C — Out-of-state seller crossing the economic nexus threshold

**Facts.** A Texas-based online retailer of custom skateboards ships from a warehouse in Austin. In calendar year 2024 it had Arizona-destination sales of $87,000. From January through October 2025 it has $115,000 of Arizona-destination sales — $90,000 through its own Shopify store and $25,000 through Amazon (where it is a marketplace seller, no FBA inventory).

**Nexus analysis.**

- 2024 Arizona gross < $100,000 threshold — no economic nexus from prior year.
- 2025 Arizona gross crosses $100,000 on date X (mid-October).
- Per A.R.S. §42-5044, nexus attaches **on the date the threshold is crossed**, and the seller has a **TPT registration obligation** for sales made **after** that date in the current calendar year, plus all sales in the following calendar year.
- Amazon marketplace sales ($25,000) are **excluded** from the seller's own TPT obligation because Amazon as marketplace facilitator under A.R.S. §42-5043 collects and remits TPT on those sales. However, **Amazon sales count toward the seller's $100k nexus threshold** under ADOR's interpretation (see ADOR Publication 622, Section IV) — so the seller cannot subtract Amazon sales to avoid the threshold.
- **Conclusion:** seller must register for an Arizona TPT license effective the date the $100k threshold was crossed.

**Registration.**

- File JT-1 (Joint Tax Application) through AZTaxes.gov.
- $12 state license fee plus city license fees for each Arizona city where the seller has economic nexus (some cities have no separate threshold and require registration once state nexus exists).

**Filing.**

- Reports Shopify sales on TPT-2 under Retail (Code 017) destination-sourced to each Arizona city.
- Does **not** report Amazon sales (Amazon files those under its own TPT license).
- Frequency: $90,000 × ~8% avg ≈ $7,200 expected annual TPT → likely quarterly.

**Tax computation on the $90,000 Shopify Arizona sales (assume avg combined rate 8.4% across destinations):**

- State (5.6%): $5,040
- County (avg ~0.7%): $630
- City (avg ~2.1%): $1,890
- **Total TPT due (approx):** $7,560.

**Late-registration exposure.** If the seller fails to register and report from the threshold-crossing date, ADOR will assess back-tax, late-filing penalties (up to 25%), late-payment penalties (up to 10%), and interest. A **Voluntary Disclosure Program** is available under ADOR Publication 632 — typically waives penalties and limits lookback to 4 years if the taxpayer comes forward before being contacted.

## 13. Interaction with Arizona Income Tax

Arizona has its own personal income tax under A.R.S. Title 43 — a **2.5% flat rate** as of tax year 2023 (Laws 2022 Ch. 321, accelerated phase-in). TPT and Arizona income tax are entirely separate regimes:

- TPT is on the **business's privilege**; income tax is on the **owner's net income**.
- TPT paid is a **deductible business expense** on the Arizona income tax return (just as it is on the federal Schedule C).
- TPT and income tax are not netted.
- A small online business with $50,000 of net profit and $5,000 of TPT remitted pays:
  - $50,000 × 2.5% AZ income tax = **$1,250 state income tax** (after federal AGI starting-point adjustments).
  - $5,000 already paid as TPT (separately) — operating expense.

The two filings have different forms (TPT-2 vs. Form 140 / 140-SBI), different due dates, and different ADOR divisions.
