## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rate (TY 2025)

Arizona imposes a **flat income tax rate of 2.5%** on all taxable income, regardless of filing status or income level. This flat rate took effect in tax year 2023.

| Filing status | Rate | Applies to |
|---|---|---|
| All statuses | 2.5% | All Arizona taxable income |

### Standard deduction (TY 2025)

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
|---|---|
| Single | $15,750 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $31,500 |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,750 |
| Head of Household | $23,625 |

Arizona also allows a **Standard Deduction Increase** equal to 34% of qualifying charitable contributions (TY 2025), calculated on page 3 of Form 140.

### Personal exemptions

Arizona does not use personal exemptions in the traditional sense. The standard deduction effectively replaces the exemption for most filers.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

1. **Starting point:** Arizona begins with **federal adjusted gross income** (federal Form 1040, Line 11).
2. **Arizona additions:** Add back amounts deducted federally but not recognized by Arizona (e.g., other states' municipal bond interest).
3. **Arizona subtractions:** Subtract Arizona-exempt income (e.g., Social Security benefits, U.S. government interest, Arizona-specific exclusions).
4. **Arizona AGI:** Federal AGI ± additions/subtractions.
5. **Deductions:** Subtract standard deduction or Arizona itemized deductions.
6. **Result:** Arizona taxable income × 2.5% = tax liability.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity
- Arizona generally conforms to the Internal Revenue Code as of a specific date (rolling conformity with some exceptions).
- Schedule C business income and deductions flow through federal AGI into Arizona's computation.

### QBI deduction (§199A)
- The federal QBI deduction reduces federal taxable income but does **not** directly apply to Arizona's computation since Arizona starts from federal AGI (above the line).
- However, Arizona allows its own subtraction for certain small business income (check current year instructions).

### SE health insurance deduction
- Flows through federal AGI (above-the-line deduction) and is automatically reflected in Arizona's starting point.

### Retirement contributions
- SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI and therefore reduce Arizona starting income.

### Home office deduction
- Federal home office deduction (simplified or actual) flows through Schedule C and is reflected in federal AGI.

### Estimated tax payments (Form 140ES)

- **Required if:** Your Arizona gross income exceeds $75,000 (single/MFS/HOH) or $150,000 (MFJ) for the current or prior year.
- **Safe harbor:** Total estimated payments + withholding must equal the lesser of 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax.
- **Due dates:** April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
- **Payment methods:** Online via AZTaxes.gov or mail Form 140ES to AZDOR.
- **Small business variant:** Form 140ES-SBI for those electing the small business income tax.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| # | Rule | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| T1-01 | Apply 2.5% flat rate to Arizona taxable income | Single rate × taxable income |
| T1-02 | Standard deduction by filing status | Fixed amounts: $15,750 / $31,500 / $23,625 |
| T1-03 | Social Security benefits fully exempt | Subtract from AZ computation |
| T1-04 | U.S. government bond interest exempt | Subtract from AZ income |
| T1-05 | Estimated tax threshold | Gross income > $75,000 (single) or $150,000 (MFJ) |
| T1-06 | Standard deduction increase | Add 34% of qualifying charitable contributions |

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| # | Rule | Why judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| T2-01 | Standard deduction vs. itemized | Taxpayer must compare both methods |
| T2-02 | IRC conformity date issues | Some federal provisions may not be adopted; requires checking current conformity |
| T2-03 | Part-year resident allocation | Requires apportionment of income to AZ residency period |
| T2-04 | Small Business Income Tax election | Taxpayer may elect to pay 2.5% separately on business income — requires evaluation of benefit |
| T2-05 | Credit for taxes paid to other states | Requires analysis of multistate income sourcing (Form 309) |
| T2-06 | Charitable contribution substantiation | Standard deduction increase requires documentation of qualified contributions |
