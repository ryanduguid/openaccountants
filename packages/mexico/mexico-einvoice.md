---

## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Who Must Comply

- **ALL taxpayers** in Mexico (personas físicas and personas morales) who carry out economic activities
- No threshold — every transaction requiring a tax receipt must produce a CFDI
- Applies to: sales of goods, services, leases, payroll, donations, exports, imports

### Document Types (TipoDeComprobante)

| Code | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| I | Ingreso | Income invoice (standard sales/services) |
| E | Egreso | Credit note / refund |
| T | Traslado | Transfer of goods (no payment) |
| N | Nómina | Payroll voucher |
| P | Pago | Payment receipt (Complemento de Pago) |

### Complementos (Supplements)

| Complemento | Use Case |
|---|---|
| Pagos 2.0 | Payment receipts for deferred/partial payments |
| Carta Porte 3.1 | Bill of lading for goods transport |
| Nómina 1.2 | Payroll details |
| Comercio Exterior 2.0 | Export invoices |
| INE | Political party donations |
| Hidrocarburos | Oil & gas sector |

### B2C Treatment

- B2C sales use RFC genérico: XAXX010101000 (domestic) or XEXX010101000 (foreign)
- Still requires full CFDI generation and PAC certification
- Simplified "factura global" available for aggregating small B2C transactions (daily/weekly/monthly)

## Section 3 -- Technical Format

### XML Schema

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Format | XML |
| Version Attribute | Version="4.0" |
| Root Element | `<cfdi:Comprobante>` |
| Primary Namespace | http://www.sat.gob.mx/cfd/4 |
| XSD Schema | cfdv40.xsd |
| Timbre Fiscal Schema | TimbreFiscalDigitalv11.xsd |
| XSLT (cadena original) | cadenaoriginal_4_0.xslt |
| Catalogs XSD | catCFDI.xsd |
| Encoding | UTF-8 |

### CFDI Lifecycle

```
Taxpayer ERP/System → Generate XML → Sign with CSD (e.firma) →
Submit to PAC → PAC validates → PAC stamps (timbrado) →
PAC returns UUID + TimbreFiscalDigital → Invoice valid →
PAC transmits copy to SAT
```

### Digital Certificates

| Certificate | Purpose |
|---|---|
| e.firma (FIEL) | General identity certificate (not for signing CFDI directly) |
| CSD (Certificado de Sello Digital) | Specifically for signing CFDI; obtained from SAT portal |
| PAC Certificate | PAC's own certificate for the timbrado (fiscal stamp) |

### Cadena Original

The "cadena original" is a pipe-delimited string of all significant invoice fields, generated via XSLT transformation. The taxpayer's digital seal (sello) is a SHA-256 + RSA signature of this cadena original.

### Communication Flow

1. Taxpayer system generates CFDI XML (signed with CSD)
2. Submit to PAC via web service
3. PAC validates structure + data against SAT catalogs
4. PAC validates receiver RFC/name/postal code against SAT database
5. PAC generates UUID (folio fiscal)
6. PAC applies TimbreFiscalDigital complement (SAT stamp)
7. PAC returns stamped CFDI to taxpayer
8. PAC sends copy to SAT within 72 hours
9. Taxpayer delivers stamped CFDI to receiver

### SAT Free Issuance Portal

- Available at portalcfdi.facturaelectronica.sat.gob.mx
- Limited to low-volume issuance
- Requires e.firma (FIEL) login
- Not suitable for automated/high-volume scenarios

| Time limit | Same fiscal year or month following issuance |
| FolioSustitucion | UUID of replacement CFDI (if motivo=01) |

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### PAC Validation Sequence

1. **Structural** — XML well-formed, conforms to cfdv40.xsd
2. **Catalog codes** — All coded fields must exist in SAT catalogs (c_FormaPago, c_Moneda, c_ClaveProdServ, c_ClaveUnidad, c_UsoCFDI, c_RegimenFiscal, etc.)
3. **RFC validation** — Receiver RFC must exist in SAT's valid RFC list (LRFC)
4. **Name matching** — Receiver Nombre must match SAT records exactly (including accents/capitalization)
5. **Postal code** — DomicilioFiscalReceptor must match SAT's registered address for that RFC
6. **Fiscal regime** — RegimenFiscalReceptor must match SAT's records
7. **Mathematical** — SubTotal = sum of Concepto.Importe; Total = SubTotal + taxes - retentions
8. **CSD validity** — Certificate not expired, not revoked, belongs to issuer RFC
9. **Seal verification** — Sello matches cadena original using CSD public key

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Error | Description | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 301 | XML structure invalid | Validate against cfdv40.xsd |
| 302 | CSD expired or revoked | Renew CSD at SAT portal |
| 303 | Invalid seal | Recompute cadena original and resign |
| 305 | Receiver RFC not in LRFC | Verify RFC exists in SAT database |
| 306 | Receiver name mismatch | Use exact name from SAT's constancia |
| 307 | Receiver postal code mismatch | Use fiscal domicile postal code |
| 402 | Invalid ClaveProdServ | Look up correct 8-digit code in SAT catalog |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### IVA (Value Added Tax)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 16% | General rate (most goods and services) |
| 0% | Basic foodstuffs, medicines, exports |
| Exempt | Education, residential rent, medical services |

### IEPS (Special Production and Services Tax)

- Applied on specific goods: alcohol, tobacco, fuel, sugary drinks, pesticides
- Rates vary by product category

### Tax Retention

| Tax | Rate | When |
|---|---|---|
| ISR retention | 10% (general) | Professional services paid to individuals |
| IVA retention | 10.6667% | Services by individuals; transport; temporary staffing |

### Calculation Rules

- Tax base per line = Cantidad × ValorUnitario (before tax)
- Tax per line = Base × TasaOCuota
- Round to 2 decimal places at line level (6 decimal places for TasaOCuota)
- Document SubTotal = sum of all line Importe values
- Document Total = SubTotal + TotalImpuestosTrasladados - TotalImpuestosRetenidos
- For PPD (deferred payment): taxes recorded in Complemento de Pago at time of actual payment

### Multi-Currency

- If Moneda ≠ MXN, must include TipoCambio (exchange rate)
- All amounts in the CFDI are in the stated Moneda
- SAT computes MXN equivalent using the stated TipoCambio

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention Period | 5 years from date the tax return was filed (CFF Art. 30); effectively 6-7 years |
| Format | Original signed XML (with TimbreFiscalDigital) |
| Accessibility | Must be available for SAT audit; queryable from SAT portal |
| Storage | Electronic; taxpayer's own systems + copy maintained by SAT |
| PDF Representation | Optional; XML is the legal document; PDF/printed version is courtesy copy |
| Complementos | Must retain all associated complementos (pagos, carta porte, etc.) |
| Cancellation Records | Retain cancelled CFDIs with cancellation acknowledgment |
| Platform Data (from May 2026) | Platforms must provide SAT permanent online access; data archived 5+ years |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Not issuing CFDI | MXN 17,020 -- MXN 97,330 per event (CFF Art. 83-IV / 84-IV) |
| Issuing CFDI without fiscal requirements | MXN 17,020 -- MXN 97,330 |
| Not delivering CFDI to client upon request | MXN 17,020 -- MXN 97,330 |
| CSD cancellation by SAT | SAT may cancel CSD for repeated violations (prevents all future CFDI issuance) |
| Simulated operations (EFOS) | 2-9 years imprisonment + fines (CFF Art. 113 Bis) |
| Acquiring/using CFDI from EFOS | Tax deductions/credits disallowed + penalty |
| Late cancellation | Administrative fines; SAT may reject cancellation |

### Receiver Consequences

- Receiver who deducts/credits a CFDI that does not meet requirements risks deduction disallowance
- ISR deductions and IVA credits require a valid CFDI with correct receiver data

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### Monthly VAT Return (Declaración Mensual IVA)

- IVA trasladado (output VAT) derived from type "I" CFDIs issued
- IVA acreditable (input VAT) derived from type "I" CFDIs received
- IVA retenido from retention CFDIs
- SAT pre-fills monthly return proposals based on CFDI data

### Annual ISR Return

- Income declared must match sum of type "I" CFDIs issued in the fiscal year
- Deductions must be backed by valid received CFDIs
- SAT cross-references reported income vs. CFDI issuance records

### Payroll (Nómina)

- Payroll CFDIs (type "N" with Nómina complemento) feed into:
  - Employee's annual tax return (pre-filled income)
  - Employer's ISR withholding obligations
  - Social security (IMSS) cross-validation

### Complemento de Pago

- For PPD method invoices, actual VAT is recognized only when payment CFDI is issued
- Cashflow-based IVA timing: VAT liability/credit arises on payment date, not invoice date
- Monthly IVA return uses payment CFDIs for deferred-payment transactions

### SAT Audit Crossmatching

- SAT automatically cross-references buyer-seller CFDI pairs
- Discrepancies flagged in taxpayer's "Buzón Tributario" (tax mailbox)
- Invitation letters ("carta invitación") issued for unexplained income vs. CFDI mismatches
