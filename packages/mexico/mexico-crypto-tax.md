| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | United Mexican States (Estados Unidos Mexicanos) |
| Tax | Impuesto Sobre la Renta (ISR) on Virtual Assets |
| Currency | MXN (Mexican Peso) — all values must be in MXN at transaction date |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 January -- 31 December) — "ejercicio fiscal" |
| Primary authority | Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta (LISR), Art. 126 (enajenación de bienes), Art. 142 (otros ingresos), Art. 152 (progressive rates) |
| Supporting legislation | Ley para Regular las Instituciones de Tecnología Financiera (Ley Fintech, 2018), Art. 30; Código Fiscal de la Federación (CFF), Art. 16-A; Circular 4/2019 Banco de México |

| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by a Mexican Contador Público (C.P.) or licensed tax professional |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Key Principles

- Mexico does NOT have a specific crypto tax law — crypto is taxed under general ISR rules
- Virtual assets are classified as "activos virtuales" (intangible movable property) under Ley Fintech Art. 30
- They are explicitly NOT legal tender, NOT foreign currency, and NOT denominated in any currency
- The SAT taxes realized gains; mere holding (HODL) does not trigger tax
- There is an annual exemption of approximately $60,000 MXN for non-habitual disposals of movable property

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether trading or occasional | Treat as habitual (actividad empresarial) — higher compliance burden |
| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without documented acquisition cost |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — Mexican residents taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Mexico-source only |
| Mining classification unclear | Treat as "otros ingresos" (Art. 142 LISR) unless clearly commercial-scale |
| CFDI required? | If in doubt, issue CFDI for business crypto transactions |
| RESICO eligibility unclear | Verify income does not exceed $3,500,000 MXN annually |

---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Legal Classification

| Term | Definition | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Activos virtuales | Digital representations of value that can be electronically transferred and used as means of payment, NOT legal tender | Ley Fintech Art. 30 |
| Bienes intangibles muebles | Intangible movable property — the SAT's fiscal classification for crypto | SAT criteria (oficios 2019–2025) |
| Enajenación de bienes | Disposal/alienation of property — the chapter under which crypto sales are taxed | LISR Art. 126 |

### 2.2 Taxable Events

| Event | Tax Treatment | LISR Chapter |
|---|---|---|
| Sale of crypto for MXN/fiat | Taxable — enajenación de bienes | Art. 126 (occasional) or Art. 100 (business) |
| Crypto-to-crypto exchange (swap) | Taxable — enajenación (disposal at FMV) | Art. 126 / Art. 100 |
| Payment for goods/services with crypto | Taxable — disposal at FMV in MXN on date of transaction | Art. 126 / Art. 100 |
| Mining rewards received | Taxable — income at FMV when received | Art. 142 (otros ingresos) or Art. 100 (business) |
| Staking rewards received | Taxable — income at FMV when received | Art. 142 (otros ingresos) |
| Crypto received as salary/payment | Taxable — employment or professional income at FMV | Art. 94 (salarios) or Art. 100 |
| Holding crypto (HODL) | NOT taxable — no enajenación has occurred | — |
| Transfer between own wallets | NOT taxable — no change in ownership | — |
| Receiving crypto as gift | Taxable to recipient if exceeds annual gift exemption | Art. 93(XXIII) LISR |

### 2.3 Occasional vs Business Activity

The SAT distinguishes between occasional disposals and habitual business activity:

| Factor | Occasional (Enajenación de bienes) | Business (Actividad empresarial) |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency | Infrequent, sporadic sales | Regular, systematic trading |
| Intent | Not primary economic activity | Profit-seeking as primary activity |
| Tax treatment | Annual declaration; $60,000 MXN exemption may apply | Monthly provisional payments; full ISR + 16% IVA potential |
| Reporting | In Declaración Anual under "enajenación" | Monthly declarations + annual |
| Cost basis adjustment | INPC inflation adjustment allowed | Full deductions per business rules |

## Section 3 -- Rate Tables

### 3.1 ISR Progressive Rates — Personas Físicas (2025)

| Lower Limit (MXN) | Upper Limit (MXN) | Fixed Quota (MXN) | Marginal Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| $0.01 | $8,952.49 | $0.00 | 1.92% |
| $8,952.50 | $75,984.55 | $171.88 | 6.40% |
| $75,984.56 | $133,536.07 | $4,461.94 | 10.88% |
| $133,536.08 | $155,229.80 | $10,723.55 | 16.00% |
| $155,229.81 | $185,852.57 | $14,194.54 | 17.92% |
| $185,852.58 | $374,837.88 | $19,682.13 | 21.36% |
| $374,837.89 | $590,795.99 | $60,049.40 | 23.52% |
| $590,796.00 | $1,127,926.84 | $110,842.74 | 30.00% |
| $1,127,926.85 | $1,503,902.46 | $271,981.99 | 32.00% |
| $1,503,902.47 | $4,511,707.37 | $392,294.17 | 34.00% |
| $4,511,707.38 | En adelante | $1,417,491.57 | 35.00% |

**Citation:** LISR Art. 152; Resolución Miscelánea Fiscal 2025.

Crypto gains are added to ALL other income for the year to determine the applicable bracket.

### 3.2 Corporate ISR Rate

| Entity Type | Rate |
|---|---|
| Personas morales (corporations) | 30% flat on net gain |

**Citation:** LISR Art. 9.

### 3.3 RESICO Rates (Régimen Simplificado de Confianza)

If the taxpayer qualifies for RESICO (total annual income ≤ $3,500,000 MXN):

| Annual Income (MXN) | Rate |
|---|---|
| Up to $300,000 | 1.00% |
| $300,001 – $600,000 | 1.10% |
| $600,001 – $1,000,000 | 1.50% |
| $1,000,001 – $2,500,000 | 2.00% |
| $2,500,001 – $3,500,000 | 2.50% |

**Warning:** RESICO applicability to crypto traders is uncertain. Conservative default: use the general progressive regime unless a tax professional confirms RESICO eligibility.

### 3.4 The 20% Alternative Rate

If a taxpayer **cannot prove** their cost basis for a crypto disposal, the SAT may apply a **20% rate on gross proceeds** instead. This is not an elective option — it is a fallback when documentation is insufficient.

**Citation:** LISR Art. 126, third paragraph.

### 3.5 Annual Exemption

| Exemption | Amount | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Enajenación de bienes muebles | ~$60,000 MXN per year (3× UMA anualizada, approx. $124,000 MXN for 2025 per some sources) | Non-habitual disposals only; habitual traders do NOT qualify |

The exact threshold is tied to the UMA (Unidad de Medida y Actualización) and updated annually.

---

## Section 4 -- Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 Accepted Methods

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| Specific identification | Primary method — match each sale to a specific acquisition lot |
| FIFO (First In, First Out) | Accepted when specific identification impractical |
| INPC-adjusted cost | Cost basis may be adjusted for inflation using INPC (Índice Nacional de Precios al Consumidor) from acquisition month to disposal month |
| Average cost | Less common; may be accepted with documentation |
| LIFO | Not standard practice |

### 4.2 Cost Basis Components

| Component | Included? |
|---|---|
| Purchase price in MXN (at exchange rate on acquisition date) | Yes |
| Exchange fees and commissions on acquisition | Yes |
| Network/gas fees on acquisition | Yes |
| Exchange fees and commissions on disposal | Yes — deductible from proceeds |
| INPC inflation adjustment | Yes — for enajenación de bienes calculation |

### 4.3 INPC Adjustment

For occasional disposals under the enajenación de bienes chapter, the cost basis can be adjusted for inflation:

```
Adjusted cost = Original cost × (INPC disposal month / INPC acquisition month)
```

This can meaningfully reduce the taxable gain for long-held assets in a high-inflation environment.

**Citation:** LISR Art. 124.

### 4.4 Unverifiable Cost Basis

If the taxpayer cannot document their acquisition cost, the SAT may apply a 20% tax on gross sale proceeds. This is punitive — it effectively assumes zero cost basis and then applies 20% to the full amount.

## Section 5 -- DeFi / Staking / Mining / Airdrop Treatment

### 5.1 Mining

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Occasional mining (hobby) | "Otros ingresos" (Art. 142 LISR) — taxable at progressive rates |
| Commercial mining operation | Actividad empresarial — ISR at progressive rates + 16% IVA on services |
| Valuation | FMV in MXN at date of receipt |
| Cost basis of mined coins | FMV at receipt (for future disposal) |
| Deductible expenses (commercial) | Electricity, equipment depreciation, internet, facility costs |
| CFDI requirement | Business miners must issue CFDI for self-billed income |

### 5.2 Staking

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Staking rewards | Taxable as "otros ingresos" at FMV when received |
| Cost basis of staking rewards | FMV at receipt date (for future disposal) |
| Staking-as-a-service | If providing service: actividad empresarial + IVA |
| Loss from slashing | Likely not deductible absent specific SAT guidance |

### 5.3 Airdrops

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Promotional airdrop | Taxable as "otros ingresos" at FMV when received |
| Fork-based distribution | Cost basis of ₩0; taxable on disposal |
| Airdrop in exchange for a service | Income at FMV — may be actividad empresarial |

### 5.4 DeFi

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| DeFi lending interest | Income at FMV — "otros ingresos" or business income |
| Liquidity provision (AMM) | Depositing tokens to pool = potential disposal; LP tokens have new cost basis |
| Yield farming rewards | Income at FMV when received |
| Impermanent loss | Not specifically addressed by SAT; likely not deductible |
| Crypto-to-crypto swaps in DeFi | Each swap is a taxable enajenación |
| Wrapping (e.g., ETH → WETH) | Arguable — conservative: treat as disposal |

---

## Section 6 -- NFT Treatment

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Purchase of NFT | Acquisition cost for future disposal |
| Sale of NFT at profit | Taxable — enajenación de bienes at progressive ISR rates |
| Creation and sale (artist/creator) | Business income (actividad empresarial) — ISR + 16% IVA |
| NFT royalties | Income — "otros ingresos" or business income depending on regularity |
| NFT-to-NFT swap | Disposal of both — compute gain/loss on each |
| IVA on NFT sales | If business activity: 16% IVA applies to NFT sales (digital service) |
| CFDI for NFT sales | Required for business transactions |

---

## Section 7 -- Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Individual Filing

| Habitual traders (actividad empresarial) | Must make monthly ISR provisional payments (pagos provisionales) by the 17th of the following month |
| Occasional sellers (enajenación) | No monthly obligation — annual declaration only |

### 7.3 CFDI Requirements

| Scenario | CFDI Required? |
|---|---|
| Business-to-business crypto transactions | Yes — must issue CFDI |
| Business receiving crypto as payment | Yes — CFDI for the underlying supply |
| Individual occasional sale | No CFDI required for personal transactions |

---

## Section 8 -- Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

### 8.1 Loss Offset Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Loss offset within same category | Losses from enajenación de bienes muebles can offset gains from enajenación de bienes muebles within the same year |
| Cross-category offset | Losses from crypto generally CANNOT offset employment income, interest, or other income categories |
| Actividad empresarial losses | Business losses can offset business income; carry-forward for up to 10 years |
| Enajenación losses | Limited offset — only against gains from same type of asset disposal |

### 8.2 Business Loss Carry-Forward

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Available to | Taxpayers under actividad empresarial regime |
| Duration | Up to 10 years |
| Adjustment | Must adjust for inflation using INPC |
| Condition | Must be properly documented and declared in the year incurred |

### 8.3 Key Limitation

Occasional sellers (enajenación de bienes) have significantly more limited loss utilization than business traders. If crypto trading generates recurring losses, consult a tax professional about whether actividad empresarial classification is more appropriate.

---

## Section 9 -- Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 SAT Enforcement Powers

| Measure | Detail |
|---|---|
| Exchange data access | SAT receives transaction data from Mexican exchanges (Bitso, etc.) and through CARF from foreign platforms (from April 2026) |
| Bank account monitoring | SAT monitors bank deposits; large unexplained deposits trigger audits |
| Discrepancia fiscal | If spending exceeds declared income, SAT can assess tax on the difference |
| Informant reporting | Third-party reporting obligations exist |

### 9.2 Penalties

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to file | 55%–75% surcharge on unpaid tax |
| Late filing | Inflation-adjusted surcharges (recargos) + fines |
| Underdeclared income | 55%–75% of unpaid tax + surcharges |
| Tax fraud (defraudación fiscal) | Criminal penalties — imprisonment and fines |
| Failure to issue CFDI | Fines per missing CFDI |

### 9.3 Transfer Pricing

For related-party crypto transactions (e.g., between a taxpayer and a controlled entity), arm's length principles apply. The SAT can recharacterize transactions at fair market value.

### 9.4 Crypto as Payment for Invoiced Services

If crypto is used to pay for services that should be invoiced, both parties have obligations: the service provider must issue a CFDI in MXN at the transaction-date exchange rate, and the payer must recognize a disposal of the crypto at FMV.

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Occasional Sale, INPC Adjustment

**Input:** Mexican tax resident, salaried employee. Bought 0.5 BTC on Bitso in January 2024 for $250,000 MXN. Sold 0.5 BTC in November 2025 for $500,000 MXN. Exchange fees: $3,000 MXN total. INPC Jan 2024: 133.24; INPC Nov 2025: 142.50 (hypothetical). No other disposals in the year. Salary income: $600,000 MXN.

**Computation:**
```
Disposal proceeds:          $500,000
Less exchange fees:          -$3,000
Net proceeds:               $497,000

Cost basis:                 $250,000
INPC adjustment:            $250,000 × (142.50 / 133.24) = $267,380
Adjusted cost basis:        $267,380

Gain:                       $497,000 - $267,380 = $229,620

Exemption check:            Single disposal, non-habitual — $60,000 exemption does NOT apply
                            if total disposals exceed the threshold (verify UMA for year).
                            Conservative: treat as fully taxable.

Combined income:            $600,000 salary + $229,620 crypto = $829,620 total

ISR on $829,620:
  Art. 152 tariff:          $110,842.74 + ($829,620 - $590,796) × 30%
                          = $110,842.74 + $71,647.20
                          = $182,489.94

Less ISR already withheld on salary (employer PAYE), the crypto gain adds
approximately $68,886 in additional ISR ($229,620 × ~30% effective marginal rate).
```

Filed in Declaración Anual by 30 April 2026.

### Example 2 -- Habitual Trader with Monthly Provisionals

**Input:** Mexican tax resident. Trades crypto full-time on Bitso and Binance. Total 2025 trading income: $1,200,000 MXN in net gains. Operating expenses (internet, equipment): $80,000 MXN. Registered under actividad empresarial.

**Computation:**
```
Gross income:               $1,200,000
Deductible expenses:         -$80,000
Net taxable income:         $1,120,000

ISR on $1,120,000:
  Art. 152 tariff:          $110,842.74 + ($1,120,000 - $590,796) × 30%
                          = $110,842.74 + $158,761.20
                          = $269,603.94

Monthly provisionals:       ~$22,467/month (subject to adjustment based on actual monthly income)
Annual reconciliation:      File Declaración Anual, credit provisional payments against annual ISR
```

Monthly provisional payments due by the 17th of the following month.

### Example 3 -- Mining Income

**Input:** Mexican tax resident operates a small mining rig at home. Mined 0.02 BTC over 2025 with total FMV of $20,000 MXN at various receipt dates. Electricity cost: $8,000 MXN.

**Computation:**
```
Mining income (otros ingresos):   $20,000 (FMV at receipt dates)
Cost basis for mined BTC:         $20,000 (for future disposal calculation)

If classified as otros ingresos (occasional):
  Added to other income for progressive rate computation
  Deductions: limited under otros ingresos chapter

If classified as actividad empresarial:
  Electricity deduction:   $8,000
  Net income:              $12,000
  ISR: at progressive rates, added to other income
  IVA: 16% may apply on mining services
```

Conservative: declare as otros ingresos unless professional confirms business classification.

## Self-Checks

Before finalising any Mexico crypto tax computation, verify:

- [ ] Has the taxpayer confirmed Mexican tax residency?
- [ ] Are all transaction values converted to MXN at the transaction-date exchange rate?
- [ ] Is the taxpayer classified as occasional (enajenación) or habitual (actividad empresarial)?
- [ ] Has the INPC adjustment been applied for enajenación de bienes?
- [ ] Is the annual exemption for movable property applicable (non-habitual only)?
- [ ] Has the 20% gross proceeds fallback been avoided by documenting cost basis?
- [ ] For business traders: are monthly provisional payments being made?
- [ ] Have all crypto-to-crypto swaps been treated as disposals?
- [ ] CFDI requirements: are business transactions properly invoiced?
- [ ] Have loss offset rules been applied correctly (same category only)?
- [ ] CARF: does the taxpayer know exchanges now report to SAT?
- [ ] Flag for reviewer: confirm UMA-based exemption threshold for the relevant year

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER state that crypto is tax-free in Mexico — realized gains are taxable under ISR
- NEVER ignore crypto-to-crypto swaps — each is a taxable enajenación
- NEVER apply the 20% gross proceeds rate by choice — it is a punitive fallback for missing cost basis
- NEVER forget INPC adjustment for occasional disposals — it can meaningfully reduce tax
- NEVER mix enajenación and actividad empresarial rules — they have different compliance obligations
- NEVER ignore monthly provisional payment obligations for business traders
- NEVER assume RESICO eligibility without verification of income limits and regime requirements
- NEVER compute gains in USD or other currencies — SAT requires MXN
- NEVER treat wallet-to-wallet transfers as taxable disposals
- NEVER ignore CARF reporting — SAT receives exchange data from April 2026
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
