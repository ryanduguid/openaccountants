## Section 2 -- Documentation Requirements

### 2.1 TP Report (Estudio de Precios de Transferencia)

|---|---|
| Required? | Yes, for taxpayers with related-party transactions (general obligation under Art. 76 LISR) |
| Threshold | All entities with controlled transactions must have TP study available |
| Content | Functions/assets/risks, method selection, comparables, arm's length analysis |
| Language | Spanish |
| Filing | Not filed; maintained and available on SAT request |

### 2.2 Local File (Archivo Local)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Required? | Yes, for entities with cumulative income > MXN ~1,940 million (2025; indexed annually) |
| Format | Per BEPS Action 13 / OECD standards with Mexico-specific content |
| Language | Spanish |
| Filing deadline | May 15 of the following fiscal year |

### 2.3 Master File (Archivo Maestro)

| Filing method | Electronic submission |

### 2.4 Country-by-Country Report (CbCR)

Mexico distinguishes between:

Both must be prepared; the Local File is more detailed and includes some Master File content.
