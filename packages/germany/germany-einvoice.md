## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates (2025/2026)

| Rate | Application |
|---|---|
| 19% | Standard rate (Regelsteuersatz) |
| 7% | Reduced rate (ermäßigter Steuersatz) -- food, books, public transport, cultural events |
| 0% | Intra-EU supplies, exports (with §4 UStG exemption code) |

### Rounding

- Line-level: net amount = quantity × unit price, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Tax amount per line: net amount × rate, rounded to 2 decimal places
- Document-level totals must equal sum of line-level amounts within each tax category
- XRechnung validation allows EUR 0.01 tolerance per tax subtotal group
- Banker's rounding (round half to even) is accepted but not required

### Multi-Rate Invoice Handling

- Each VAT rate requires a separate tax subtotal group (BG-23)
- Tax category codes: S (standard), AA (reduced), Z (zero-rated), E (exempt), AE (reverse charge), K (intra-EU), G (export), O (outside scope)
- For reverse charge (§13b UStG), use category code AE with rate = 0%
- Tax exemption reason (BT-120/BT-121) must be populated for zero-rate and exempt categories

### §14 UStG Invoice Requirements

German VAT law (§14 UStG) mandates specific content that must appear in the structured data:

- Full name and address of seller and buyer
- Tax number (Steuernummer) or VAT ID (USt-IdNr.)
- Invoice date and sequential invoice number
- Quantity and description of goods/services
- Delivery/service date or period
- Net amount per rate, applicable tax rate, and tax amount
- Total gross amount

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 8 years (§14b UStG; reduced from 10 years by Bürokratieentlastungsgesetz IV, effective 2025) |
| Format | Original structured format (XML) as received or sent |
| GoBD compliance | Must satisfy Grundsätze zur ordnungsmäßigen Führung und Aufbewahrung (GoBD, updated 14 July 2025) |
| Hybrid invoices (ZUGFeRD) | Only the structured XML part must be archived; the PDF part is only required if it contains additional tax-relevant information (e.g., booking notes) |
| Immutability | Archived invoices must be tamper-proof -- no modifications allowed after receipt |
| Verfahrensdokumentation | Written procedural documentation describing the entire e-invoice lifecycle (receipt, processing, archiving) is mandatory |
| Storage location | Germany or EU member state; tax authorities must have full online access |
| Audit access | Three levels: Z1 (direct access to DV system), Z2 (indirect access via data export), Z3 (data carrier handover) |

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to issue proper invoice (§14 UStG breach) | Administrative fine up to EUR 5,000 per occurrence (§26a UStG) |
| Retention violation | Fine up to EUR 1,000 for specific breaches; up to EUR 30,000 for serious cases (§26a Abs. 1 UStG) |
| Non-compliant invoice → input VAT deduction denied | Buyer may lose right to deduct input VAT until a corrected compliant invoice is received |
| Estimated tax assessment | Tax authority may estimate turnover and VAT liability if records are insufficient |

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT Return Integration

- E-invoices provide the data basis for the monthly/quarterly Umsatzsteuer-Voranmeldung (advance VAT return) via ELSTER
- Properly archived e-invoices serve as documentary evidence for input VAT deduction claims
- Non-compliant invoices (missing mandatory fields) may result in denied input VAT deduction until corrected
- The BMF has indicated plans for future pre-filled VAT returns based on e-invoice data, aligned with the EU ViDA initiative

### Income Tax Integration

- For Einzelunternehmer (sole proprietors) and Freiberufler (freelancers), e-invoice revenue data feeds into the Einkommensteuer return (Anlage S or Anlage G)
- EÜR (Einnahmenüberschussrechnung -- cash-basis accounting) practitioners must ensure e-invoice dates align with payment dates for revenue recognition
- Bilanzierung (accrual accounting) practitioners recognise revenue at invoice date

### Intra-EU Reporting

- Intra-EU supplies reported via Zusammenfassende Meldung (recapitulative statement) must reconcile with e-invoices issued with tax category K (intra-community supply)
- Buyer VAT IDs on e-invoices (BT-48) must match VIES-validated numbers

### GoBD and Tax Audit

- Tax auditors may request Z1 (direct system access), Z2 (data export in GDPdU/IDEA format), or Z3 (data carrier) access to archived e-invoices
- Verfahrensdokumentation must describe the e-invoice workflow from receipt to archiving
- Failure to produce compliant archives during Betriebsprüfung can trigger estimated assessments with penalty surcharges (Zuschläge)
