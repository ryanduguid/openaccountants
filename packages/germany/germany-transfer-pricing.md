## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

### 3.1 Definition

§1 AStG: Income of a taxpayer from cross-border transactions with related parties must be determined as if the transactions had been agreed between unrelated parties under comparable conditions (arm's length principle). Germany applies a "hypothetical arm's length test" where no comparable exists.

### 3.2 Accepted Methods

| Method | Accepted |
|---|---|
| Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) | Yes |
| Resale Price Method (RPM) | Yes |
| Cost Plus Method (CPM) | Yes |
| Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) | Yes |
| Profit Split Method (PSM) | Yes |
| Hypothetical arm's length test | Yes (unique to Germany) |

### 3.3 Preferred Method

Standard CUP is preferred where reliable comparables exist. The hypothetical arm's length test applies when no comparable transactions are available (particularly for unique intangibles and business restructurings).

### 3.4 Range/Median

Tax authorities may use the median of the interquartile range for adjustments if taxpayer's result falls outside the arm's length range.

## Section 8 -- Safe Harbours

Germany does not have broad statutory safe harbour rules.

| Area | Detail |
|---|---|
| Low-value intra-group services | OECD simplified approach (cost-plus 5%) generally accepted in practice |
| Interest rates | No formal safe harbour; Bundesbank reference rates used as benchmarks |
| Documentation thresholds | Below EUR 6m (goods) / EUR 600k (other), no Local File required but arm's length must still be demonstrated |
| Small transactions | No statutory de minimis; all cross-border related-party transactions subject to arm's length principle |

### 8.1 Practical Implications of Documentation Thresholds

While Germany has no formal safe harbour, the documentation thresholds effectively reduce compliance burden:
- Below EUR 6m goods / EUR 600k other: no Local File required
- Below EUR 100m group revenue: no Master File required
- However, the general obligation under §90 AO to cooperate with tax authorities remains
- Tax authorities can still challenge pricing even without formal documentation requirements
