| Mixed wallet (staked + unstaked) | Separate tracking required |
| Airdrop cost basis | €0 at receipt (income = FMV at receipt under §22) |

---

## Section 2 -- Rules and Classification

### 2.1 Private Veräußerungsgeschäfte (§23 EStG)

Crypto sold/exchanged within 1 year of acquisition is a private sale. Gain = sale price - acquisition cost - directly related expenses (Werbungskosten).

**Taxable events:**
- Selling crypto for EUR/fiat
- Exchanging crypto for another crypto (e.g., BTC → ETH)
- Paying for goods/services with crypto
- Providing crypto as collateral that is liquidated

**Non-taxable events:**
- Transferring between own wallets
- Buying crypto with fiat (acquisition, not disposal)
- Holding >1 year then selling (steuerfrei)
- Gift (but recipient inherits acquisition date + cost)

### 2.2 Staking as Sonstige Einkünfte (§22 Nr. 3 EStG)

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Classification | Sonstige Einkünfte (miscellaneous income) |
| Taxable event | Receipt of staking rewards |
| Taxable amount | Fair market value (EUR) at time of receipt (Zufluss) |
| Freigrenze | €256/year for ALL sonstige Einkünfte combined (§22 Nr. 3 S. 2) |
| Freigrenze behavior | If exceeded, entire amount taxable |
| Holding period of rewards | Starts fresh from receipt date -- 1 year to tax-free sale |
| Haltefrist extension | NO extension for staked coins (BMF 2022, Rz. 87) |

### 2.3 Mining

| Scenario | Classification |
|---|---|
| Hobby mining (occasional, small scale) | §22 Nr. 3 EStG (sonstige Einkünfte) |
| Commercial mining (sustained, profit intent, significant hardware) | §15 EStG (Gewerbebetrieb) |
| Pool mining | Same rules -- proportional share of block reward |

**Commercial mining triggers:**
- Gewerbesteuer obligation (municipal trade tax)
- Gewerbeanmeldung required
- IHK membership
- Full income tax on mining income at progressive rates
- Depreciation (AfA) allowed on mining hardware

**Hobby mining (§22 Nr. 3):**
- €256 Freigrenze applies
- Hardware costs deductible as Werbungskosten
- No Gewerbesteuer

### 2.4 Lending (Crypto Lending / DeFi Lending)

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Interest received | §22 Nr. 3 EStG (sonstige Einkünfte) |
| Taxable amount | FMV in EUR at receipt |
| Freigrenze | €256/year (shared with staking and other §22 Nr. 3 income) |
| Holding period of original coins | NOT extended by lending (BMF 2022) |
| Return of lent coins | Not a taxable event |

### 2.5 DeFi Specific Treatments

| DeFi Activity | Classification | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Token swap on DEX | §23 EStG disposal + acquisition | Same as centralised exchange trade |
| Liquidity provision (LP) | Disposal of tokens into pool = §23 event | Acquisition of LP tokens |
| LP token removal | Disposal of LP token = §23 event | Reacquisition of underlying |
| Yield farming rewards | §22 Nr. 3 (sonstige Einkünfte) | FMV at receipt |
| Airdrops | §22 Nr. 3 at FMV on receipt | Cost basis = FMV at receipt for future sale |
| Hard forks (new coins) | Cost basis €0; acquisition date = fork date | Taxable on sale within 1 year |
| Wrapped tokens (e.g., WETH) | Potentially §23 event (exchange) | Conservative: treat as disposal |
| NFT sale | §23 EStG (same as any crypto asset) | 1-year Haltefrist applies |
| Governance token rewards | §22 Nr. 3 at FMV | Same as staking rewards |

### 2.6 FIFO Method (Mandatory)

Per BMF-Schreiben Rz. 59--63:
- FIFO applies per wallet/exchange account (walletbezogen)
- Alternatively, taxpayer may apply FIFO across ALL wallets (universal FIFO) if consistently applied
- Once chosen, method must be maintained consistently
- LIFO, HIFO, and other methods are NOT permitted

**Per-wallet FIFO example:**
- Wallet A: bought 1 BTC on 01.01.2024, bought 1 BTC on 01.06.2024
- Wallet A: sold 1 BTC on 15.03.2025
- FIFO: the 01.01.2024 BTC is sold → held >1 year → tax-free

## Section 3 -- Computation

### 3.1 Gain Calculation (§23)

```
Veräußerungsgewinn = Veräußerungspreis
                   - Anschaffungskosten
                   - Werbungskosten (directly attributable costs)

Where:
- Veräußerungspreis = EUR value at time of sale/exchange
- Anschaffungskosten = EUR value at time of acquisition (FIFO)
- Werbungskosten = exchange fees, network fees (gas), directly related costs
```

### 3.2 Annual Aggregation

```
Step 1: Calculate gain/loss on each individual disposal within Haltefrist
Step 2: Sum all gains and losses from §23 transactions for the year
Step 3: Check net result against €1,000 Freigrenze
        - Net gain < €1,000 → entirely tax-free
        - Net gain ≥ €1,000 → entire net gain is taxable
Step 4: If taxable, add to other taxable income in Einkommensteuererklärung
Step 5: Apply personal income tax rate (Anlage SO)
```

### 3.3 Loss Treatment (§23 Abs. 3)

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Offsetting within year | §23 losses offset §23 gains in same year |
| Cannot offset against other income | §23 losses ONLY offset §23 gains (horizontal Verlustausgleich prohibited) |
| Carry-back | 1 year carry-back to prior year §23 gains (§10d Abs. 1) |
| Carry-forward | Unlimited carry-forward to future §23 gains |
| Verlustvortrag application | Automatically applied by Finanzamt if declared |

### 3.4 Staking/Mining Income Computation

```
Staking/Mining Income (§22 Nr. 3):
Step 1: Record FMV in EUR of each reward at time of receipt
Step 2: Sum all §22 Nr. 3 income for the year
        (includes staking, lending interest, mining hobby, airdrops)
Step 3: Check against €256 Freigrenze
        - Total < €256 → entirely tax-free
        - Total ≥ €256 → entire amount taxable
Step 4: Deduct directly related Werbungskosten (e.g., validator costs)
Step 5: Net amount added to taxable income
```

---

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### 5.1 Crypto-to-Crypto Exchanges

Every crypto-to-crypto exchange (e.g., BTC → ETH) is TWO events:
1. Disposal of BTC (realises gain/loss under §23 if <1 year held)
2. Acquisition of ETH (new Anschaffungskosten = FMV at time of exchange)

The exchange rate used must be documented (e.g., CoinMarketCap, exchange order fill price).

### 5.2 Gifts and Inheritance

| Scenario | Rule |
|---|---|
| Gift (Schenkung) | Recipient inherits acquisition date AND cost basis of donor |
| Inheritance (Erbschaft) | Heir inherits acquisition date AND cost basis of deceased |
| Implication | If donor held >1 year, recipient can sell immediately tax-free |
| Schenkungsteuer | Separate gift tax may apply (Freibeträge: €500,000 spouse, €400,000 child) |

### 5.3 Stablecoins

- Stablecoins (USDT, USDC, DAI) are "andere Wirtschaftsgüter" -- same rules apply
- Exchange gains from EUR→stablecoin→EUR within 1 year are taxable
- FX movement on stablecoin denominated in USD is a §23 event

### 5.4 Lost/Stolen Crypto

- If provably lost (e.g., lost private key, verified hack), may claim as Verlust under §23
- Finanzamt may require proof (police report, blockchain evidence)
- Scam losses: deductible as §23 Verlust if disposal can be demonstrated

### 5.5 ICO / Token Sales

- Acquisition of ICO tokens: Anschaffungskosten = EUR paid
- Sale within 1 year: §23 gain/loss
- Worthless tokens: may realise loss by provable abandonment or sell for minimal amount

### 5.6 Fork Coins

- New coins received from hard fork: Anschaffungskosten = €0
- Acquisition date = date of fork
- Sale within 1 year of fork: gain = full proceeds (minus fees)
- Sale after 1 year from fork: tax-free

### 5.7 Margin/Futures Trading

- Gains from crypto futures/CFDs: typically §20 EStG (Kapitalerträge) -- 25% Abgeltungsteuer
- Gains from leveraged spot trading: §23 EStG (same as normal trading)
- BFH case law developing -- document approach taken

## Section 6 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Simple Sale Within Haltefrist

Bought 2 BTC on 15.03.2025 for €50,000 total (€25,000 each).
Sold 1 BTC on 01.08.2025 for €35,000. Exchange fee: €50.

Gain = €35,000 - €25,000 - €50 = €9,950
Held < 1 year → taxable under §23.
€9,950 > €1,000 Freigrenze → entire €9,950 is taxable income.

### Example 2 -- Sale After Haltefrist

Bought 1 ETH on 01.01.2024 for €2,000.
Sold 1 ETH on 15.01.2025 for €4,000.

Held > 1 year → completely tax-free. No reporting obligation.

### Example 3 -- Staking Rewards

Received 0.5 ETH staking rewards throughout 2025.
Total FMV at each receipt: €1,800.
No other §22 Nr. 3 income.

€1,800 > €256 Freigrenze → entire €1,800 is taxable as sonstige Einkünfte.
Added to personal income; taxed at marginal rate.

### Example 4 -- Under Freigrenze

Total §23 gains in 2025: €900.
Total §22 Nr. 3 income (staking): €200.

§23: €900 < €1,000 → tax-free.
§22 Nr. 3: €200 < €256 → tax-free.
No tax obligation and no reporting required.

## Section 7 -- Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Correction |
|---|---|
| Applying 25% Abgeltungsteuer | WRONG -- crypto is §23, not §20. Personal rate applies. |
| Using LIFO instead of FIFO | WRONG -- only FIFO allowed per BMF Schreiben |
| Ignoring crypto-to-crypto trades | Each swap is a taxable disposal + new acquisition |
| Not tracking staking rewards separately | Each reward has its own acquisition date and cost basis |
| Assuming Haltefrist extends with staking | WRONG -- BMF 2022 confirmed NO extension |
| Treating Freigrenze as Freibetrag | WRONG -- Freigrenze means if exceeded, ALL is taxable |
| Not reporting because "exchange didn't report" | Doesn't matter -- taxpayer has Erklärungspflicht |
