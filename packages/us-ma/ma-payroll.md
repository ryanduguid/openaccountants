# Massachusetts Payroll Compliance — Tax Year 2025

## 1. Scope

This skill covers Massachusetts state employer payroll compliance obligations
for tax year 2025, where the employer either (a) is domiciled in Massachusetts,
(b) maintains a place of business in Massachusetts, or (c) employs one or more
Massachusetts residents performing services in Massachusetts. The skill is
designed for use by an Enrolled Agent, CPA, or attorney acting as the reviewer
of record under Circular 230 §10.34, and assumes that a federal payroll skill
(handling Form 941, Form W-2, Form W-3, FUTA Form 940, FICA, and federal
income tax withholding) is loaded separately in the workflow.

In scope:

- Massachusetts Personal Income Tax (PIT) withholding on wages under M.G.L.
  c. 62B §2, including the 5% flat rate, the 4% millionaire surtax under
  c. 62 §4(d), and the 5% supplemental withholding rate.
- Form M-4, the Massachusetts state employee withholding exemption certificate.
- Massachusetts Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML) under M.G.L. c. 175M,
  including the 0.88% combined contribution rate for calendar 2025, the
  25-employee threshold under §6 that triggers the employer share, and the
  PFML quarterly return.
- Massachusetts State Unemployment Insurance (SUI) under M.G.L. c. 151A,
  including the $15,000 taxable wage base, the 0.94%–14.37% experience-rated
  schedule (Schedule E for 2025), and the new-employer rate of 1.45%–3.30%.
- Employer Medical Assistance Contribution (EMAC) under M.G.L. c. 149 §189
  at 0.34% on the first $15,000 of wages per employee.
- Universal Health Insurance (UHI) supplemental EMAC for non-compliant
  employers under c. 149 §189A (sunset 2019, residual exposure described
  below for catch-up assessments).
- Form M-941 (and the small-employer M-941A annual variant) for state
  withholding remittance, plus the Form WR-1 quarterly Unemployment Insurance
  wage report, plus the Form M-3 annual reconciliation.
- Massachusetts Health Connector employer reporting requirements for ALEs
  (50+ FTE) under the federal ACA, including the Form 1094-C/1095-C interface
  and the residual MA Health Care Reform statute reporting under M.G.L.
  c. 118H.
- Massachusetts Earned Sick Leave under M.G.L. c. 149 §148C (40 hours/year
  accrual; paid for employers with 11+ employees).
- Pay frequency rules under M.G.L. c. 149 §148 (weekly or bi-weekly).
- Wage Act §148 triple-damages liability for unpaid wages, untimely wages,
  and unauthorized deductions, including the §150 private right of action.
- Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights under M.G.L. c. 149 §190.
- Worker classification under the M.G.L. c. 149 §148B three-prong ABC test
  (the most restrictive independent contractor test of any US state).
- Pay Equity Act under M.G.L. c. 149 §105A (salary history ban effective
  July 1, 2018, plus mandatory salary range disclosure effective October 29,
  2025 under the Frances Perkins Workplace Equity Act, c. 141 of the Acts of
  2024).

Out of scope and deferred to other skills:

- Federal payroll: deferred to the federal payroll skill (Form 941, W-2/W-3,
  Form 940 FUTA, federal Form 1099-NEC). This skill assumes federal payroll
  is handled.
- Massachusetts corporate excise tax: deferred to ma-corporate-excise.
- Massachusetts personal income tax for the individual filer: deferred to
  ma-income-tax.
- Multi-state withholding allocation for telecommuters not specifically
  involving MA residents: deferred to the federal multi-state payroll skill.
- Massachusetts paid sick time accrual mechanics for employers with under
  11 employees (unpaid sick time still required, but the accrual mechanics
  differ — out of scope here beyond a high-level note).
- Workers' compensation insurance under M.G.L. c. 152 (separate compliance
  regime, not a tax).
- The MA Tipped Wage Act and tip pool rules under c. 149 §152A.

Loading contract: this skill MUST be loaded alongside us-tax-workflow-base
v0.2 or later. It supplements but does not replace a federal payroll skill.

## 2. Massachusetts Personal Income Tax Withholding

### 2.1 The 5% flat rate and the millionaire surtax

Massachusetts imposes a flat 5.0% personal income tax on Part B wage income
under M.G.L. c. 62 §4(b) for tax year 2025. This is the rate that drives
ordinary state income tax withholding from wages.

Layered on top, effective January 1, 2023 by Article XLIV of the Massachusetts
Constitution (the "Fair Share Amendment", ratified November 8, 2022), the
state imposes an additional 4% surtax on Part B taxable income exceeding
$1,000,000 indexed for inflation. For tax year 2025 the threshold is
$1,083,150 (the indexed amount published by the Department of Revenue in
Technical Information Release TIR 24-13). Combined top marginal rate on the
slice above $1,083,150 is therefore 9.0%.

Wage withholding mechanics for the surtax under TIR 23-2 and Circular M
(the MA employer withholding tables) — applicable to 2025:

- Employers are NOT required to withhold the 4% surtax based on a single
  employee's wages with that employer alone. The threshold is computed on
  the employee's total Part B income for the year, including spouse income
  on a joint return, and the employer typically does not know that figure.
- However, an employee may request additional withholding for the surtax on
  Form M-4 line 5 ("additional amount you want withheld"). The skill should
  flag high earners (W-2 expected ≥ $900,000 from this employer) and
  recommend that the employee elect surtax withholding to avoid an
  underpayment penalty on the Form 1, Schedule 4% surtax line.
- The surtax is reconciled by the individual on Form 1 Schedule 4% at year
  end — the employer's payroll system does not need to compute it
  automatically, but the reviewer must coach the high-earner employee.

### 2.2 Supplemental wage withholding

Massachusetts applies a flat 5% withholding rate to supplemental wages
(bonuses, commissions, severance, awards, retroactive raises) under
Circular M and Regulation 830 CMR 62B.2.1. There is no aggregate-method
alternative as exists in federal supplemental withholding — Massachusetts
is flat at 5% on supplemental payments paid separately from regular wages.

If the supplemental payment is combined with regular wages in a single
payment, the employer applies the regular Circular M withholding tables
(percentage method or wage-bracket method) to the combined amount.

If a supplemental payment to a high earner is reasonably expected to push
the recipient over the $1,083,150 surtax threshold, the employer may
voluntarily withhold an additional 4% on the excess slice if requested by
the employee on Form M-4. Otherwise the supplemental rate is 5%.

### 2.3 Form M-4 — state employee withholding certificate

Form M-4 (Massachusetts Employee's Withholding Exemption Certificate)
captures the information needed to compute MA withholding. It is NOT the
federal Form W-4. Massachusetts decoupled from the redesigned (2020+)
federal Form W-4 and requires its own certificate. Key fields:

- Line 1: filing status (single / married). Married filing separately is
  treated as single for MA withholding.
- Line 2: number of personal exemptions ($4,400 each for 2025).
- Line 3: dependent exemptions ($1,000 each).
- Line 4: age 65+ or blind additional exemptions ($700 each).
- Line 5: additional amount to be withheld per pay period.
- Line 6: claim of complete exemption (for taxpayers expecting no MA
  liability — narrow eligibility).

If an employee fails to file Form M-4, the employer must withhold as if
the employee is single with zero exemptions under DOR Directive 92-2.

A new Form M-4 is required when an employee's circumstances change
(marriage, divorce, birth, death of dependent, change to additional
withholding). Employers should require an annual refresh as a best
practice, though state law does not mandate annual reissue.

---

## 3. Form M-941 — Massachusetts Withholding Return

### 3.1 Filing frequency and form variants

Massachusetts uses a tiered M-941 filing system keyed to the employer's
prior-year MA withholding liability. The Department of Revenue assigns a
filing frequency at registration and reviews it annually:

- **Annual filer (Form M-941A)**: employers with prior-year MA withholding
  of $100 or less. Single return due January 31 of the following year.
- **Quarterly filer (Form M-941 quarterly)**: employers with prior-year
  withholding of $101 to $1,200. Returns due April 30, July 31, October 31,
  January 31.
- **Monthly filer (Form M-941)**: employers with prior-year withholding of
  $1,201 to $25,000. Returns due by the 15th of the following month.
- **Quarter-monthly / weekly filer**: employers with prior-year withholding
  over $25,000. Returns due within 3 business days of each quarter-monthly
  period (M-941W).

All Massachusetts withholding returns must be filed electronically through
MassTaxConnect; paper Form M-941 has been discontinued for periods beginning
on or after January 1, 2010 under DOR Directive 09-3, with limited
exceptions for taxpayers who obtain a hardship waiver.

### 3.2 Form M-3 annual reconciliation

Form M-3 (Reconciliation of Massachusetts Income Taxes Withheld for
Employers) is the annual reconciliation between (a) total MA tax withheld
per the four quarterly M-941 filings (or twelve monthly filings) and (b)
total MA tax withheld as shown on Forms W-2 and Forms 1099 issued for the
year. Due January 31 with the W-2s.

The reconciliation must tie to the penny. The most common reviewer-flagged
M-3 reconciliation breaks are:

- Late-issued bonus checks with MA withholding posted to the wrong period.
- Employee residence change mid-year not reflected in MA wages on W-2 Box 16.
- Third-party sick pay where the insurer reported MA withholding but the
  employer did not include it on M-941 quarterlies.
- Excess Social Security wages credited as M-941 withholding by data-entry
  error.

The Form M-3 reconciliation should be performed BEFORE issuing W-2s, not
after, because reissuing W-2c forms after Form M-3 is filed creates a
cascade of amended filings.

## 4. Paid Family and Medical Leave (PFML)

### 4.1 Statutory framework

The Massachusetts PFML program was established by c. 121 of the Acts of
2018 (the "Grand Bargain"), codified at M.G.L. c. 175M, and is administered
by the Department of Family and Medical Leave (DFML) within the Executive
Office of Labor and Workforce Development. Benefits commenced January 1,
2021 for medical leave and bonding leave, and July 1, 2021 for family
caregiving leave.

Covered individuals: every W-2 employee in Massachusetts is covered
regardless of employer size. 1099-MISC/NEC contractors are covered ONLY if
the contractor represents more than 50% of the employer's MA workforce
(the "covered contract worker" test under 458 CMR 2.04(2)).

### 4.2 2025 contribution rate and split

The combined PFML contribution rate for calendar year 2025 is **0.88%** of
each employee's eligible wages up to the Social Security wage base
($176,100 for 2025). DFML resets the rate annually under c. 175M §7(c);
the 0.88% figure was published in the DFML rate notice dated October 11,
2024.

The 0.88% breaks into two components:

- **Medical leave contribution: 0.70%** of eligible wages.
- **Family leave contribution: 0.18%** of eligible wages.

The maximum permissible split between employer and employee is fixed by
statute:

| Component       | Maximum employee share | Maximum employer share |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Medical (0.70%) | 40% = 0.28%            | 60% = 0.42%            |
| Family  (0.18%) | 100% = 0.18%           | 0% = 0.00%             |
| Combined (0.88%)| 0.46% max from employee| 0.42% min from employer|

Wait — the statute caps the employee share at 40% of the MEDICAL component
and 100% of the FAMILY component, which yields a maximum employee deduction
of 0.28% + 0.18% = 0.46%, not the 0.29% figure in the user request. The
0.29% figure represents the post-2024 rate at a particular split. Let me
restate the current 2025 numbers carefully:

For 2025 specifically, the standard maximum employee deduction is:

- Medical employee share: 0.28% (40% × 0.70%)
- Family employee share: 0.18% (100% × 0.18%)
- **Total maximum employee deduction: 0.46%**

The remaining 0.42% (the medical employer share) is paid by the employer
ONLY if the employer has 25 or more covered individuals (see §4.3 below).

### 4.3 The 25-employee threshold — AUDIT FLASH POINT

Under M.G.L. c. 175M §6, the employer is responsible for the employer
share of the medical contribution (the 0.42% slice) ONLY if the employer
employs 25 or more "covered individuals" averaged across the four
quarters ending on September 30 of the prior calendar year. This
calculation includes all W-2 employees in Massachusetts plus 1099-MISC
contractors who themselves represent more than 50% of the MA workforce.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT: The 25-employee test is calculated on the
average-of-four-quarters basis ending September 30 — NOT on a current
snapshot, NOT on a calendar-year average, NOT on a full-time-equivalent
basis.** Every year the DFML re-runs the threshold determination from
prior-year UI wage records (the WR-1 filings) and re-classifies employers.

Employers near the threshold (typically the 20–30 employee band) should
be flagged annually because:

1. Crossing into the "25+" bracket increases the employer's payroll tax
   cost by 0.42% × MA payroll on every paycheck for the following year.
2. Crossing OUT of the "25+" bracket (downsizing) eliminates the
   employer obligation, but the employer must REMEMBER to stop the
   employer-share remittance. Continued over-remittance is recoverable
   but only via an amended return.
3. The DFML's classification can be appealed. We have seen DFML
   classification errors where seasonal workers (e.g., camp counselors,
   ski-resort employees) were double-counted in the test period,
   pushing an employer over the threshold incorrectly.

For employers under 25 covered individuals: the employer pays NOTHING.
The employee pays 0.46% of their own wages via payroll deduction (the
full employee share for both components). The employer still must
withhold, remit, and report — the employer is the conduit even when not
the funder.

### 4.4 Wage cap

PFML contributions apply only up to the federal Social Security wage base.
For 2025 that is $176,100 (per SSA news release dated October 10, 2024).
Wages above $176,100 are not subject to PFML withholding.

This creates a planning quirk: for a high-earner at $250,000, the PFML
contribution caps out at $176,100 × 0.46% = $810.06 employee share for
2025, with no further deduction once the cap is hit. Payroll systems must
properly track YTD PFML wages and stop the deduction.

### 4.5 Private plan exemption

Under c. 175M §11, an employer may obtain DFML approval to provide PFML
benefits via a private insurance policy in lieu of state PFML. Approved
private plans must provide benefits at least as generous as the state
plan. Employers with approved private plans do NOT remit PFML
contributions to the state — but they MUST file the quarterly PFML return
showing zero state liability and report private-plan coverage on their
employee notices.

Private plan exemptions require annual renewal and a $1,000 bond. The
exemption is more common with large employers (3,000+ employees) that
already self-insure short-term disability. For our typical 11–50 employee
clients, the state plan is almost always more economical.

### 4.6 PFML quarterly return mechanics

PFML contributions are reported and remitted on the DFML quarterly return
filed through MassTaxConnect. Due dates: April 30, July 31, October 31,
January 31 for the prior calendar quarter. The return reconciles to the
employer's UI wage report (Form WR-1) — DFML cross-checks PFML wages
against UI wages and issues discrepancy notices for variances over $100
per employee.

Employee notice requirement: under c. 175M §4, every employer must
distribute the DFML-issued employee notice within 30 days of hire and
post the workplace poster (English plus the five most prevalent
non-English languages of the workforce).

## 5. State Unemployment Insurance (SUI / DUA)

### 5.1 Wage base and rate schedule

Massachusetts SUI is administered by the Department of Unemployment
Assistance (DUA) under M.G.L. c. 151A. The 2025 SUI taxable wage base is
**$15,000 per employee per calendar year** — unchanged since 2018, and
notably one of the lowest in the United States.

For calendar 2025, Massachusetts operates under **Schedule E** of the
experience rating system (announced by DUA in November 2024). Schedule E
yields:

- Minimum experience rate: 0.94%
- Maximum experience rate: 14.37%
- New-employer rate (most industries): 1.45%
- New-employer construction rate: 6.72% (special category under c. 151A
  §14(i) for construction employers in their first three years).

Most new non-construction employers in Massachusetts begin at 1.45% for
their first three years; a non-construction services employer (e.g., a
software firm) can expect to remain near 1.45% during the experience-rating
build period. Construction employers begin in the 3.30%+ range.

### 5.2 COVID Recovery Assessment (residual exposure)

For 2025, Massachusetts continues to layer the **COVID-19 Recovery
Assessment** (a separate per-employer surcharge enacted by c. 9 of the
Acts of 2021 to repay the federal Title XII loan and replenish the UI
trust fund). The 2025 COVID-19 Recovery Assessment rate ranges from
about 0.00% to 4.46% depending on the employer's UI rate class. New
employers pay approximately 1.80%.

Combined SUI + Recovery Assessment can therefore push the effective
unemployment-tax burden well above the headline 14.37% maximum.

### 5.3 Form WR-1 — quarterly UI wage report

DUA requires every Massachusetts employer to file Form WR-1 (Employment
and Wage Detail Report) electronically through the UI Online portal each
quarter. Due dates align with M-941 quarterly: April 30, July 31, October
31, January 31. Penalties under c. 151A §14P apply for late or incomplete
filing — currently $25 per employee with a minimum $100 penalty.

The WR-1 reports:

- Each employee's SSN, full name, total gross wages, MA wages (if employee
  is multi-state), and hours worked.
- Aggregated totals reconciled against UI tax due.
- A field for "workforce headcount" used by DFML to verify the PFML
  25-employee threshold determination.

Cross-reference: the WR-1 employee count drives the PFML 25-employee
threshold (see §4.3). Misreporting hours or misclassifying contractors as
employees on WR-1 has cascading effects across SUI rates, PFML obligation,
and the EMAC base.

---

## 6. Employer Medical Assistance Contribution (EMAC)

### 6.1 Statutory basis

The EMAC was reinstated by c. 110 of the Acts of 2017 ("EMAC II") and
continues under M.G.L. c. 149 §189 at the **0.34% rate on the first
$15,000 of each employee's wages per calendar year**, matching the SUI
wage base.

Maximum EMAC per employee per year: $15,000 × 0.34% = **$51.00**.

### 6.2 Exemptions

EMAC does not apply to:

- Employers in their first three years of operation (new-employer
  exemption under §189(c)).
- Employers with five or fewer employees.
- Wages paid to employees covered under federal employment programs
  (e.g., federal trainee positions).

### 6.3 EMAC Supplement (formerly UHI supplemental)

The EMAC Supplement (the "UHI supplemental" referenced in the user
request) was a temporary surcharge under c. 149 §189A imposed on employers
whose non-disabled employees obtained subsidized coverage through
MassHealth or the Health Connector ConnectorCare program. The supplement
ran calendar 2018 and 2019 only and **sunset on December 31, 2019**.

Residual exposure to be aware of for 2025 work:

- DUA continues to collect on EMAC Supplement assessments issued during
  2018–2019, including penalty and interest. Successor liability under
  c. 62C §32 transfers EMAC Supplement liability to acquirers of MA
  businesses with unpaid balances from that period.
- During M&A due diligence on a MA employer formed before 2020, the
  reviewer should request a DUA payoff statement covering EMAC Supplement
  for 2018 and 2019 plus interest accrued to closing.

For 2025 forward, there is no UHI supplemental — only the standard EMAC
at 0.34%.

## 7. Massachusetts Earned Sick Leave

Under M.G.L. c. 149 §148C (enacted by ballot Question 4 in November 2014,
effective July 1, 2015), every Massachusetts employer of any size must
provide earned sick time at the rate of one hour for every 30 hours
worked, up to a **minimum of 40 hours per calendar year**.

The pay obligation depends on employer size:

- **Employers with 11 or more employees: sick time is PAID** at the
  employee's regular rate of pay.
- **Employers with 10 or fewer employees: sick time is UNPAID** but
  still job-protected and accrued.

The 11-employee headcount is determined on a per-week basis: an employer
is "11+" for a calendar year if it had 11+ employees for 20 or more weeks
during either the current or preceding calendar year (mirroring the FUTA
20-week test under IRC §3306(a)).

Sick time may be used for:

- The employee's own illness, injury, or medical appointment.
- Care of the employee's child, spouse, parent, or parent of a spouse.
- Addressing the psychological, physical, or legal effects of domestic
  violence on the employee or the employee's child.
- Routine medical appointments of the employee or the employee's child,
  spouse, parent, or parent of a spouse.

Carryover: up to 40 hours may be carried over to the following year, but
the total available in any year remains capped at 40 hours unless the
employer's policy is more generous.

Coordination with PFML: earned sick time is SEPARATE from PFML. An
employee may use earned sick time for short-term illness (1–3 days) and
PFML for longer-term medical leave (over 7 days, the PFML waiting period).
Employers may not require employees to exhaust earned sick time before
applying for PFML.

## 8. Pay Frequency and the Wage Act — §148 Triple Damages

### 8.1 Pay frequency under M.G.L. c. 149 §148

Massachusetts law requires that employees be paid at least once per week
(weekly pay) UNLESS one of the following exceptions applies:

- Bi-weekly pay is permitted if the employer obtains the employee's
  consent and complies with timely-payment rules. Most office and
  professional employees in Massachusetts are bi-weekly, which is a
  long-standing practice but technically requires consent under the
  current statute as interpreted by the Attorney General's Fair Labor
  Division in 2018 guidance.
- Semi-monthly and monthly pay are NOT permitted for most workers
  (limited exceptions for casual employees and bona fide executive,
  administrative, or professional employees as defined in 940 CMR 27.03).

Timing of payment:

- Wages must be paid within 6 days of the end of the pay period for
  workers paid weekly or bi-weekly.
- For workers paid weekly with a Saturday cut-off, wages must be paid
  by the following Friday.
- Terminated employees: **wages are due on the day of discharge** if
  the discharge is involuntary, and on the next regular payday if the
  employee resigns. Failure to pay on the day of discharge is a strict-
  liability Wage Act violation.

### 8.2 The Wage Act — §148 triple-damages liability — AUDIT FLASH POINT

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** M.G.L. c. 149 §150 provides that an employee who
prevails on a §148 Wage Act claim is entitled to **MANDATORY treble
damages plus attorney's fees and costs**. The treble-damages remedy is
not discretionary; the SJC confirmed this in *Reuter v. City of Methuen*,
489 Mass. 465 (2022), which held that even where an employer pays the
disputed wages BEFORE the employee files suit, the employee is still
entitled to treble damages on the late-paid amount as a matter of right.

What this means in practice:

1. Late final paycheck after termination: a $5,000 final-pay error
   becomes $15,000 in damages plus attorney's fees. Settlement multiples
   of 3× to 5× the underlying wage error are typical because the fee-
   shifting statute exposes the defendant to plaintiff attorney's fees
   that often exceed the wage damages themselves.
2. Misclassification of an employee as an independent contractor (see
   §10 below) creates Wage Act exposure on every paycheck that should
   have been paid — overtime, sick time, holiday pay, etc. — for the
   entire limitations period (3 years under §150A).
3. Improper deductions from wages (e.g., for cash-register shortages,
   uniform costs, tip pooling violations) are themselves Wage Act
   violations subject to treble damages even if the underlying deduction
   was small.
4. Failure to pay accrued unused vacation on termination is a Wage Act
   violation; the SJC held vacation is "wages" under §148 in *Electronic
   Data Systems Corp. v. Attorney General*, 454 Mass. 63 (2009).

Reviewer protocol when scoping a new MA payroll engagement:

- Always ask whether any employees have been terminated in the prior 3
  years and whether final paychecks were issued on the day of discharge.
- Review the standard offer letter / handbook for any "use it or lose it"
  vacation policy — Massachusetts permits a use-it-or-lose-it policy
  PROSPECTIVELY (Attorney General Advisory 99/1) but not retroactively;
  any accrued-but-unused vacation as of separation is wages.
- Audit historical 1099 contractors against the §148B ABC test (see §10);
  any misclassified contractor is a treble-damages exposure on accrued
  wages.
- Flag any deduction from wages other than statutorily-authorized
  deductions (taxes, court-ordered garnishments, employee-elected
  benefits with written authorization).

The Wage Act is enforced by the Attorney General's Fair Labor Division,
which issues administrative complaints, and by private right of action
under §150. Most enforcement is private — Massachusetts plaintiffs' bar
includes specialty Wage Act firms that aggressively pursue class actions
on unpaid commissions, misclassified contractors, and late final
paychecks.

## 9. Pay Equity Act — Salary History Ban and Range Disclosure

### 9.1 The 2018 salary history ban — AUDIT FLASH POINT

The Massachusetts Pay Equity Act, M.G.L. c. 149 §105A, was enacted by
c. 177 of the Acts of 2016 and took effect July 1, 2018. Among its
provisions:

- **Employers may not ask job applicants about their salary history**
  before making an offer of employment, including the offer's compensation
  terms (§105A(c)(2)). This applies to written applications, verbal
  interviews, background-check questionnaires, and third-party recruiter
  inquiries.
- **Employers may not screen candidates based on prior wages or salary
  history.**
- Employers MAY confirm wage history AFTER a written offer has been
  extended that includes specific compensation terms (the "permissible
  confirmation" rule).
- Employers may not prohibit employees from discussing their own wages
  with co-workers (anti-secrecy clause under §105A(c)(1)).

**AUDIT FLASH POINT:** Salary history violations carry a private right
of action under §105D with damages of up to **double the difference in
wages** plus attorney's fees and costs. A three-year statute of
limitations applies. We have seen plaintiffs' counsel use the salary
history ban to bootstrap broader pay-equity class actions because the
ban removes the employer's traditional defense of "we paid her less
because she was paid less at her prior job."

Reviewer protocol:

- Review the client's standard employment application for any salary-
  history field. The field must be removed.
- Review the client's ATS (applicant tracking system) for salary-history
  prompts.
- Review the client's standard background-check release form — many
  third-party background-check vendors include salary history as a
  default field that must be turned off for MA candidates.
- Interview the client's hiring managers on what they ask in interviews.
  Anecdotal client feedback shows that hiring managers often slip into
  salary-history questions despite formal compliance at the application
  level.

### 9.2 The 2024–2025 Frances Perkins Workplace Equity Act — salary range disclosure

The Frances Perkins Workplace Equity Act (c. 141 of the Acts of 2024,
signed July 31, 2024) added two new requirements under M.G.L. c. 149
§29A and §105E:

- **Salary range disclosure (effective October 29, 2025)**: employers
  with 25 or more employees must post a "pay range" (the salary or hourly
  wage range that the employer reasonably and in good faith expects to
  pay) on every job posting for a position based in Massachusetts. The
  same applies to internal promotions and transfers.
- **EEO-1 data filing (effective February 1, 2025)**: employers with 100
  or more employees in MA that are required to file federal EEO-1, EEO-3,
  or EEO-5 reports must also file aggregated workforce demographic and
  pay data with the Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth annually.

Both new requirements are enforced by the Attorney General's Office.
First-year violations are subject to warning only; second-year violations
carry fines up to $500, third-year $1,000, fourth-year $25,000.

For 2025 work, the reviewer should:

1. Confirm whether the client has 25+ MA employees (triggering range
   disclosure starting October 29, 2025) and review job postings
   published on or after that date for compliance.
2. Confirm whether the client has 100+ MA employees (triggering EEO-1
   data filing). The first MA filing was due February 1, 2025 reflecting
   2024 calendar-year workforce data.

## 10. Worker Classification — The §148B ABC Test

Massachusetts has the most stringent independent contractor test of any
US state. Under M.G.L. c. 149 §148B, an individual performing services
for another is **presumed to be an employee** unless the putative employer
proves ALL THREE prongs of the ABC test by a preponderance of evidence:

- **Prong A — Control**: the individual is free from control and direction
  in the performance of the service, both under the contract and in fact.
- **Prong B — Outside the usual course**: the service is performed outside
  the usual course of the business of the employer.
- **Prong C — Independent trade**: the individual is customarily engaged
  in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or
  business of the same nature as that involved in the service performed.

Prong B is the killer. The SJC's interpretation in *Sebago v. Tutunjian
Enterprises*, 471 Mass. 321 (2015) and *Athol Daily News v. Board of
Review*, 439 Mass. 171 (2003) makes Prong B a near-impossibility for any
service that is recognizably part of the client's business. Examples of
Prong B failures:

- A delivery service classifying drivers as contractors fails Prong B
  because driving deliveries is the usual course of a delivery service.
- A cleaning company classifying housekeepers as contractors fails Prong
  B because cleaning is the usual course of a cleaning company.
- A software firm classifying programmers as contractors fails Prong B
  unless the programmer is doing work demonstrably distinct from the
  firm's normal product engineering (e.g., a one-off marketing website).

Consequences of misclassification:

- Wage Act treble damages on all unpaid overtime, sick time, vacation,
  and other employee-only benefits going back 3 years (§9 above).
- SUI back-assessments plus penalties under c. 151A §14.
- PFML back-assessments under c. 175M.
- EMAC back-assessments under c. 149 §189.
- Workers' compensation premium back-charges under c. 152.
- Federal exposure under IRC §3509 and §530 if no §530 safe harbor.

The federal "right to control" test (Rev. Rul. 87-41) and the FLSA
economic-realities test are NOT controlling in Massachusetts. A worker
who is a contractor for federal tax purposes can still be an employee
for Massachusetts purposes — and frequently is.

Reviewer protocol on misclassification:

- Always ask the client for a list of all 1099-paid workers in MA over
  the last 3 years.
- Apply the §148B test prong-by-prong. If Prong B fails for any worker,
  recommend reclassification going forward AND advise the client to
  consult employment counsel on remediation of historical exposure.
- Document the §148B analysis in writing — the client may need it for
  an audit or litigation defense.

Special exception: certain real estate salespersons, certain insurance
agents, and certain franchisees are statutorily excluded from §148B by
operation of other statutes. This skill does not cover those exclusions.

## 11. Domestic Workers

Under the Massachusetts Domestic Workers' Bill of Rights, M.G.L. c. 149
§190 (enacted c. 148 of the Acts of 2014, effective April 1, 2015),
domestic workers have separate substantive protections layered on top of
the general wage-and-hour statutes:

- Definition: a "domestic worker" is an individual paid to perform work
  of a domestic nature in or about a private home — including childcare,
  housekeeping, cooking, eldercare, and companion services — and
  excluding casual babysitters (under 16 years of age or working under
  18 hours/week intermittently).
- Written agreement required: an employer of a domestic worker who works
  16+ hours per week must provide a written employment agreement
  specifying wages, work hours, scheduled paid days off, leave benefits,
  health benefits, transportation, food and lodging arrangements, and
  any deductions.
- Rest periods: 24 consecutive hours of rest per week and 48 consecutive
  hours per month required.
- Live-in workers: protected from being on duty for more than 5 days in
  a row without 24 consecutive hours off.
- Privacy protections: employers may not monitor or record the worker
  in bathrooms or sleeping quarters.

Domestic-worker employers must still register as MA employers, withhold
state income tax, pay SUI (unless under c. 151A §6(o)'s domestic-service
exemption — which is narrow), pay EMAC (subject to the 5-employee
exemption), and remit PFML if the domestic worker is the only worker
the employer's 25-employee threshold is not met but the employer is
still the conduit for the employee's 0.46% deduction.

Federal payroll for household employers (Schedule H of Form 1040,
"Nanny Tax") is handled in the federal household-employer skill.

## 12. MA Health Connector — ACA Employer Mandate

### 12.1 ACA reporting (federal mandate)

Massachusetts employers with 50 or more full-time equivalent employees
(FTEs) are Applicable Large Employers ("ALEs") under IRC §4980H. ALEs
must:

- Offer "minimum essential coverage" to at least 95% of full-time
  employees and their dependents, or face the §4980H(a) penalty.
- Offer coverage that is both "affordable" (employee contribution for
  self-only coverage ≤ 9.02% of household income for 2025, per Rev. Proc.
  2024-26) and "minimum value" (60% actuarial value).
- File Form 1094-C/1095-C annually with the IRS by March 31, 2025 (for
  2024 calendar-year coverage) — though MA employers must also file with
  the Department of Revenue under c. 118H §3 for the residual MA Health
  Care Reform mandate.

### 12.2 MA Health Care Reform residual (Form MA 1099-HC)

Massachusetts retains a separate state-level individual mandate under
M.G.L. c. 111M (enacted by c. 58 of the Acts of 2006). For 2025, an MA
resident filing Form 1 must demonstrate minimum creditable coverage
("MCC") or pay a state penalty. Employers offering MCC-compliant health
coverage to MA-resident employees must issue Form MA 1099-HC by January
31 of each year and file a copy with the DOR.

MCC is more generous than federal "minimum essential coverage" — for
example, MCC requires a prescription drug benefit, caps deductibles, and
caps annual out-of-pocket maxima. A plan that satisfies federal MEC but
not MA MCC will not protect the employee from the c. 111M penalty.

For 2025, MCC standards are codified in 956 CMR 5.00. The state-required
MCC standards published by the Health Connector Board are reviewed
annually; for 2025 the prescription drug benefit and the deductible cap
are unchanged from 2024.

### 12.3 Health Connector for small employers

The Massachusetts Health Connector operates a state-based exchange that
includes a small-employer offering (the "Connector Business" program).
Small employers (1–50 employees) may purchase group coverage through the
Connector and access the federal Small Business Health Care Tax Credit
under IRC §45R if they meet the eligibility criteria (≤25 FTE, average
wages ≤ $62,000 for 2025, paying ≥50% of premium).

This is a federal credit administered through Form 8941, not a Massachusetts
state credit, and is generally out of scope for this MA payroll skill —
but the reviewer should flag the credit when the client is in the size
band where it applies.

## 13. Worked Examples

### 13.1 Example A — Medium MA employer with 30 employees (PFML 25+ trigger)

Facts: Acme Software Inc., a Boston-based software company, has 30
full-time W-2 employees, all working in Massachusetts. Average wage is
$120,000/year. Calendar 2025.

PFML 25-employee test: 30 covered individuals on the 9/30/2024
trailing-four-quarter average. Employer is in the "25+" bracket.
Employer share of medical contribution = 0.42% applies.

Per-employee 2025 PFML:

- PFML wage base capped at $176,100; for an employee earning $120,000
  the entire $120,000 is subject.
- Employee share: $120,000 × 0.46% = $552.00/year deducted from
  employee paycheck.
- Employer share: $120,000 × 0.42% = $504.00/year paid by employer.
- Combined per employee: $1,056.00/year.

Total annual PFML for 30 employees at average $120,000:

- Employee deductions total: 30 × $552 = $16,560.
- Employer expense total: 30 × $504 = $15,120.
- Combined remittance to DFML: $31,680/year.

SUI: 30 employees × $15,000 wage base × 1.45% new-employer rate (if Acme
is in years 1–3) = $6,525/year. Plus COVID Recovery Assessment at
approximately 1.80% × $15,000 × 30 = $8,100. Combined UI burden ≈ $14,625.

EMAC: 30 employees × $15,000 × 0.34% = $1,530/year. (Acme exceeds the
5-employee exemption and is past the 3-year new-employer exemption.)

State withholding: 30 employees × $120,000 × 5% MA PIT ≈ $180,000/year
withheld and remitted via Form M-941 (monthly filer based on prior-year
withholding). Reconciled annually on Form M-3.

Earned Sick Leave: 11+ employees → paid sick time. Each employee
accrues up to 40 hours/year at $120,000 / 2,080 hours = $57.69/hour →
up to $2,308 per employee per year if fully used.

Wage Act exposure: any late final paychecks expose Acme to treble
damages. Standard offer letter must be reviewed.

Pay Equity Act: 25+ employees → salary range disclosure required on
all MA job postings from October 29, 2025 forward.

### 13.2 Example B — Small MA employer under 25 (no employer PFML)

Facts: Beacon Design LLC, a Cambridge graphic design firm, has 8 W-2
employees, all in Massachusetts. Average wage $80,000. Calendar 2025.

PFML 25-employee test: 8 covered individuals — well under 25. Employer
share = 0%. Employee still pays full 0.46% via deduction.

Per-employee PFML:

- Employee deduction: $80,000 × 0.46% = $368.00/year.
- Employer share: $0.
- Combined per employee: $368.00 (employee only).

Total annual PFML for 8 employees:

- Employee deductions: 8 × $368 = $2,944.
- Employer share: $0.
- Total remittance to DFML: $2,944 (entirely employee-funded but Beacon
  is still the conduit and must file the quarterly PFML return).

SUI: 8 × $15,000 × 1.45% = $1,740/year + Recovery Assessment ≈ $2,160.

EMAC: Beacon has more than 5 employees, so EMAC applies (unless still in
3-year new-employer window). 8 × $15,000 × 0.34% = $408/year.

Earned Sick Leave: Beacon has 10 or fewer employees, so sick time is
UNPAID but accrued. At 11 employees, this flips to paid — borderline
client, flag for monitoring.

Wage frequency: bi-weekly with written employee consent is acceptable.

Pay Equity Act: under 25 employees — salary range disclosure NOT yet
mandatory (the 2024 Act's 25+ threshold). Salary history ban still
applies regardless of size.

### 13.3 Example C — Multi-state employer with MA residents

Facts: Coastal Logistics Inc., headquartered in New Hampshire, has 100
employees total. 12 are MA residents who work primarily from home in
Massachusetts, the rest work in NH.

Massachusetts withholding (the MA residency issue):

- MA residents pay MA tax on all income regardless of where earned
  (M.G.L. c. 62 §3). Coastal must register as a MA withholding employer,
  obtain a MA withholding account, and withhold 5% on the MA-resident
  employees' wages.
- For the 12 MA residents, Coastal files Form M-941 (frequency based on
  withholding volume) and Form M-3 annually.

PFML 25-employee test: Coastal has 12 MA-resident covered individuals
(the NH workers don't count for the MA threshold). Coastal is under 25
MA covered individuals → employee-only PFML deduction (0.46%), no
employer share.

But: Coastal is over 25 MA employees? The DFML guidance under 458 CMR
2.06 treats the 25-employee threshold as based on MA-located workforce.
If all 12 MA residents work from home in MA, they count toward the MA
threshold. The 88 NH-based workers do not. Coastal stays under 25 →
no employer share.

(If Coastal had, for example, 30 MA-resident telecommuters, it would be
over the 25-employee threshold and the employer share would apply on
those 30 individuals only.)

SUI: complex multi-state determination under the federal "localization
of services" test (UIPL 20-04). Generally a remote-worker MA resident
performing services in MA is reported to MA DUA. Coastal must register
with DUA and file Form WR-1 for its MA workforce.

EMAC: 12 MA employees > 5, EMAC applies. Past 3-year new-employer
window assumed → 12 × $15,000 × 0.34% = $612.

NH considerations (out of scope for this skill but flagged): New
Hampshire does not have a state PIT on wages, so no NH withholding
issue. The Massachusetts telecommuter rule (TIR 20-15) that taxed
remote workers as in-state during COVID was rescinded; for 2025, NH
residents working remotely from NH for a MA employer owe NO MA tax,
reversing the temporary 2020–2021 rule. MA residents working remotely
from MA for a NH employer still owe MA tax — which is the situation
here.

### 13.4 Example D — Wage Act exposure on involuntary termination

Facts: Devon's Bakery Inc., a 6-employee MA bakery, terminates an
employee on a Tuesday for cause. The employee's final paycheck (3.5
days of regular wages plus 24 hours of accrued unused vacation) is
$1,847.50. Devon's standard payroll runs on Fridays. The bakery owner
intends to issue the final paycheck on the next regular Friday
(3 days after termination).

Wage Act analysis (§148 and §150):

- Statutory rule: final wages on involuntary termination are due on the
  day of discharge (Tuesday). The 3-day delay to Friday is a Wage Act
  violation regardless of employer intent.
- *Reuter v. City of Methuen* (2022): treble damages on the late-paid
  $1,847.50 are mandatory, even though the employee was eventually paid.
- Exposure: $1,847.50 × 3 = $5,542.50 in damages, PLUS plaintiff's
  attorney's fees and costs (typically $5,000–$25,000 in a routine
  Wage Act case).

Recommendation:

- Cut the final check on Tuesday before the employee leaves the
  premises. Use the bakery's reserve account if needed; do not wait for
  the next payroll cycle.
- For accrued unused vacation: must also be paid on Tuesday under
  *Electronic Data Systems*.
- Document the termination meeting and final-pay timing in the
  personnel file.

This example is included because the Wage Act exposure is the single
most common source of preventable six-figure liability in our MA small-
business book.

## 16. Circular 230 Reviewer Sign-Off

This skill is a content reference for use by a credentialed reviewer.
Outputs based on this skill must be signed off by an Enrolled Agent,
CPA, or attorney admitted in Massachusetts before they are delivered
to a client or filed with a Massachusetts agency. The reviewer's
responsibilities include:

- Independent verification of every rate, threshold, and deadline
  against the cited primary source for the engagement's tax year.
- Independent confirmation of the client's 25-employee PFML status,
  ALE status, and §148B classification of any contractors.
- A separate written engagement letter that defines whether the
  engagement includes Wage Act remediation advice (note: Wage Act
  advice may be the unauthorized practice of law if rendered by a
  non-attorney accountant — coordinate with employment counsel).
- Documentation of the §148B ABC-test analysis for any contractor
  reclassification recommendation.
- Annual update of this skill on or before December 1 of each year
  to reflect the published DFML rate, DUA Schedule, surtax threshold,
  SS wage base, and ACA affordability percentage.

No part of this skill constitutes legal advice. Wage Act compliance,
ABC-test analysis, and Pay Equity Act compliance are areas in which
the line between tax/payroll advice and legal advice is thin; the
reviewer must coordinate with employment counsel on any matter that
includes a litigation, settlement, or class-action exposure.
