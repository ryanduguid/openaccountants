## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Income tax rates

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Part A income (interest, dividends, capital gains from non-MA obligations) | 5.00% | M.G.L. c. 62, § 4(a) |
| Part B income (wages, salaries, self-employment, most other income) | 5.00% | M.G.L. c. 62, § 4(b) |
| Part C income (short-term capital gains) | 8.50% (subject to 50% deduction, effective rate ~12%) | M.G.L. c. 62, § 4(c) |
| Long-term capital gains | 5.00% | M.G.L. c. 62, § 4(b) |

### Millionaire's surtax (4% additional tax)

| Tax year | Surtax threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2023 | $1,000,000 | Article 44 |
| 2024 | $1,053,750 | Inflation-adjusted |
| 2025 | $1,083,150 | Inflation-adjusted |
| 2026 | TBD (inflation-adjusted, typically announced late in preceding year) | M.G.L. c. 62, § 5A |

The 4% surtax applies only to the portion of taxable income **exceeding** the threshold. For a taxpayer with $1,100,000 in TY2025 taxable income, the surtax applies to $16,850 ($1,100,000 − $1,083,150).

### Deductions and exemptions

Massachusetts does **not** use a standard deduction in the federal sense. Instead, it provides:

| Item | Amount (TY2025) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal exemption — Single | $4,400 | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3(B)(a) |
| Personal exemption — Head of Household | $6,800 | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3(B)(b)(2) |
| Personal exemption — MFJ | $8,800 | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3(B)(b)(1) |
| Dependent deduction | $1,000 per dependent | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3(B)(a)(3) |
| Rental deduction | 50% of rent paid, max $3,000 | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3(B)(a)(9) |

### Filing threshold

Everyone whose Massachusetts gross income is $8,000 or more must file.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

Massachusetts uses its **own income classification system** rather than starting directly from federal AGI. However, the computation references federal Form 1040 amounts extensively.

Massachusetts income is divided into three parts:
- **Part A:** Interest, dividends, and net capital gains on non-Massachusetts obligations
- **Part B:** Wages, salaries, self-employment income, pensions, annuities, and most other income
- **Part C:** Short-term capital gains and gains on collectibles

### Key differences from federal

| Item | Massachusetts treatment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| No standard deduction | MA uses personal exemptions and specific deductions instead | M.G.L. c. 62, § 3 |
| Social Security | Fully exempt | M.G.L. c. 62, § 2(a)(2)(E) |
| Interest from MA obligations | Exempt | M.G.L. c. 62, § 2 |
| Interest from other states | Taxable (add back any federal exclusions) | M.G.L. c. 62, § 2 |
| Short-term capital gains | Taxed at 8.50% (not the standard 5%) | M.G.L. c. 62, § 4(c) |

### Resulting computation

Compute Part A, Part B, and Part C income separately → subtract applicable deductions and exemptions → apply the appropriate rate to each part → sum = Massachusetts gross tax → minus credits → plus 4% surtax if applicable.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe $400 or more.

| Voucher | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Use Form 1-ES for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance
Massachusetts generally follows federal treatment — the deduction is taken as a Part B deduction.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))
Massachusetts generally follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce Part B income.

### Home office deduction
Massachusetts follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)
Massachusetts does **not** allow the federal QBI deduction. Massachusetts has its own income computation that does not incorporate the QBI deduction.

### Health insurance mandate
Massachusetts has an individual health insurance mandate (separate from the ACA). Failure to maintain minimum creditable coverage may result in a penalty assessed on Form 1 (Schedule HC). This is relevant for self-employed individuals who must obtain their own coverage.
