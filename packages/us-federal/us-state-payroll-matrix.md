# US 50-State Payroll Reference Matrix (Tax Year 2025)

## 1. Scope

This reference covers payroll obligations for employers with W-2 employees in any combination of the 50 US states plus the District of Columbia. Coverage areas:

- State income tax (PIT) withholding: registration forms, employee certificates, quarterly returns, due dates
- State Unemployment Tax Act (SUTA) contributions: 2025 taxable wage base, new-employer rate, experience-rated range
- State new-hire reporting under 42 U.S.C. §653a (federal 20-day deadline; state-specific portals)
- State disability insurance (SDI) and short-term disability mandates (CA, NY, NJ, RI, HI, PR — not all flagged here)
- State paid family and medical leave (PFML) mandates: CA, NY, NJ, RI, MA, WA, OR, CT, CO, DC, MN (effective 2026), DE (effective 2026), MD (effective 2026)
- Local income / occupation / privilege taxes: PA Act 32 EIT, OH RITA/CCA, KY occupational license fees, NYC resident tax, AL/MO/MI/MD/IN/DE municipal income taxes
- State-specific retirement mandates: CalSavers, IL Secure Choice, OR OregonSaves, CT MyCTSavings, MD Saves, VA RetirePath, CO SecureSavings, NJ Secure Choice, NY Secure Choice
- Transit / special district payroll taxes: OR TriMet & Lane Transit, NY MCTMT, WA Cares Fund

**Out of scope:** federal Forms 941/940/W-2/W-3 (covered in `us-form-941-940-payroll.md`), federal §3401(c) statutory-employee classification, multi-state allocation methods (covered in `us-multi-state-allocation.md`), employer-sponsored retirement plans (covered in `us-self-employed-retirement.md`), workers' compensation insurance rates (a state-specific commercial-insurance matter, not a tax skill).

**Audience:** US CPAs, EAs, and payroll providers servicing multi-state employers. This skill is a quick-reference table; it is not a substitute for the state agency website on any given filing date.

## 2. How to use this matrix

1. **Identify each state of employment** — based on where the employee physically performs services, not where the employer is domiciled. The seven convenience-of-employer states (NY, NJ — limited, CT, PA, NE, AR, DE) may reach remote workers even outside the state.
2. **For every employment state, check three things:**
   - Income tax withholding registration (Column 3)
   - SUTA registration in the state where wages are localized under the four-part FUTA test (26 USC §3306(j))
   - New-hire reporting within 20 days of hire (Column 6)
3. **For PFML / SDI mandates:** if the state is in Column 7 or 8 as "Y," the employer must register with the state insurance agency and remit contributions (employer share, employee share, or both).
4. **For local taxes:** if Column 9 flags "Y," consult the city/municipality directly. PA Act 32 employers must capture the employee's PSD code (political subdivision code) at hire.
5. **Cross-reference Section 5** for the state-by-state quirks before finalizing the payroll setup.

## 3. Quick-reference tables

### 3.1 Multi-state employer essentials

A "multi-state employer" for new-hire reporting purposes (42 U.S.C. §653a(b)(1)(B)) is one with employees in two or more states who elects to report all new hires to a single state. The election is filed with HHS Office of Child Support Services. All other employers must report to each state where the employee works.

### 3.2 No-PIT states (9)

These states have no personal income tax. Employers still owe SUTA, new-hire reporting, federal withholding, and (where applicable) workers' compensation and state-specific levies.

| State | SUTA Agency | Special Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Alaska (AK) | AK DOL Employment Security | Employee SUI contribution 0.50% of wages (one of two states; NJ and PA are the others) |
| Florida (FL) | FL DOR — "Reemployment Tax" not "SUTA" | First $7,000 of wages |
| Nevada (NV) | NV DETR | Modified Business Tax (MBT) on payroll over $50K/quarter |
| New Hampshire (NH) | NH Employment Security | No PIT on wages; 4% tax on interest/dividends repealed for 2025 |
| South Dakota (SD) | SD DOL Reemployment Assistance | — |
| Tennessee (TN) | TN DOL Workforce Development | Hall Income Tax repealed 2021; unemployment-only |
| Texas (TX) | TX Workforce Commission (TWC) | Form C-3 quarterly |
| Washington (WA) | WA ESD | PFML + Cares Fund LTC mandate — see Section 5 |
| Wyoming (WY) | WY DWS | — |

### 3.3 Paid-leave / SDI states (12 in 2025, expanding through 2026)

|---|---|---|---|
| California | SDI + PFL | 1.20% (employee only) | Employee 100%; no wage cap (SB 951) |

| Massachusetts | PFML | 0.88% | Split employer/employee per MA DFML schedule |
| Washington | PFML + Cares Fund | PFML 0.92%; LTC 0.58% | PFML split; LTC employee-only |
| Oregon | Paid Leave Oregon | 1.00% | Employee 60% / Employer 40% (employers ≥25) |
| Connecticut | CT Paid Leave | 0.50% (employee only) | Employee 100%; wage base = SS base |
| Colorado | FAMLI | 0.90% | 50/50 employer/employee (employers ≥10) |
| District of Columbia | DC PFL | 0.75% | Employer-only |
| Minnesota | MN Paid Leave (eff. 1/1/2026) | 0.88% projected | Split per MN DEED |

### 3.4 Local income tax states (8)

| State | Localities | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Pennsylvania | ~2,500 municipalities & school districts | Act 32 EIT — employee residence PSD code controls |
| Ohio | ~600 municipalities | RITA, CCA, or city-administered |
| Kentucky | ~210 counties/cities | Occupational license fees |

- **SDI (CA-EDD Form DE 9 / DE 9C)** is now 1.20% with **no wage cap** since 2024 (SB 951 removed the cap). A $500K/yr executive pays $6,000+ to SDI annually. **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** payroll providers from 2023 or earlier still capping at the old wage base.
- **CalSavers** retirement mandate: any employer with 1+ employee that does not sponsor a qualified retirement plan must register and facilitate Roth IRA contributions. Deadline elapsed 12/31/2023 for all sizes.
- **PIT brackets** to 12.3% + 1% Mental Health Services Tax on income >$1M = 13.3% top marginal.
- **DE 9 / DE 9C** is filed quarterly through e-Services for Business; due last day of month after Q-end. DE 9C is the wage-detail return; DE 9 is the contribution return.
- **WTPA wage notice** must be furnished at hire (Labor Code §2810.5).

### 5.2 New York — the convenience-of-employer trap

- **NYS-45** is the *combined* quarterly return: state PIT WH + SUTA + MCTMT (where applicable). One form, four parts.
- **Convenience-of-employer rule (TSB-M-06(5)I):** if a NY employer permits remote work for the employee's convenience (not the employer's necessity), the wages are NY-sourced even if the employee never sets foot in NY. This rule cost out-of-state remote workers ~$1B+ in NY tax during 2020-2022. **AUDIT FLASH POINT** when onboarding a remote employee for a NY-based employer.
- **MCTMT** (Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax): 0.34-0.60% on payroll where total quarterly payroll within the MCTD (12 downstate counties) exceeds $312,500. Self-employed have a separate MCTMT regime.
- **NY PFL** funded via employee payroll deduction (0.388% of wages capped at NYSAWW × 0.388%) remitted to the private DBL carrier.
- **NYC** has a resident-only city PIT (3.078-3.876% graduated); employer must withhold for NYC residents but not for non-residents. **Yonkers** has both resident (16.75% of NY state tax) and non-resident (0.5%) earnings tax.

### 5.3 New Jersey — multi-deduction stub mandate

- Employee paychecks must reflect **separate line items** for:
  - NJ SIT
  - NJ UI/HC/WD (combined)
  - NJ Workforce Development Partnership Fund
  - NJ SDI (TDI) — employee portion
  - NJ FLI — Family Leave Insurance
- **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** the SUI base ($43,300), TDI base ($165,400), and FLI base ($165,400) are *different* — payroll software must carry three wage bases.
- NJ-927 is the quarterly combined return.

### 5.4 Pennsylvania — Act 32 EIT compliance

- Every employee completes the **Residency Certification Form** at hire, declaring:
  - Resident PSD code (6-digit political subdivision identifier)
  - Work-location PSD code
  - Resident EIT rate
  - Non-resident EIT rate (for work location)
- Employer withholds the **higher** of the two rates and remits to the work-location's Tax Collection District (one of 69).
- **LST** (Local Services Tax) is a flat $52/yr maximum, withheld in equal installments. If the employee works in multiple LST jurisdictions, the $52 cap is shared and the employee files for refund.
- **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** PSD-code mismatches generate notices from any of the ~21 active TCDs (Berkheimer, Keystone, Capital Tax, etc.). A wrong PSD code on day one will compound for years.

### 5.5 Ohio — RITA/CCA municipal withholding

- ~600 Ohio municipalities impose a local income tax (0.5-3.0%). Most are administered through one of:
  - **RITA** (Regional Income Tax Agency) — ~330 municipalities
  - **CCA** (Central Collection Agency, Cleveland-based) — ~50 municipalities
  - **Self-administered** (Columbus, Cincinnati, Akron, Toledo, etc.)
- Withholding rules under **HB 110 (2021)** and the **20-day rule**: employer withholds for the work-location city for the first 20 days an employee works there, then switches to the principal-place-of-work municipality.
- Employees who live in a city with a higher rate than their work city are entitled to a "courtesy withholding" of the difference, but it is voluntary for the employer.
- **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** remote workers post-2021 sometimes get incorrectly withheld for the office-city when they actually never go there. HB 110 phased out the COVID-era principal-place-of-work emergency rule; the 20-day test now applies.
- Separate **school-district income tax (SDIT)** withholding on Form SD-101 for ~190 school districts (paid by residents of those districts).

### 5.6 Washington — Cares Fund LTC + PFML stack

- **WA Cares Fund:** 0.58% employee-only payroll tax (no wage cap) funding a state long-term-care trust. **Opt-out window closed 12/31/2022 for existing LTCi holders;** very few are exempt now.
- **WA PFML:** 0.92% combined; employer share 28.57%, employee share 71.43% for 2025 (varies annually based on premium experience).
- **No PIT** so employers register only with WA ESD for both unemployment and PFML.
- **AUDIT FLASH POINT:** out-of-state employer with WA-resident remote employee must register for both PFML and Cares Fund — many miss this.

### 5.7 Oregon — TriMet & Statewide Transit

- **TriMet payroll tax (0.8237% 2025):** employers pay on wages of services performed within the TriMet district (Portland metro 3-county area). Filed on Form OR-OQ.
- **Lane Transit District (LTD):** 0.79% on services performed in the LTD area (Eugene metro).
- **Statewide Transit Tax (STT):** 0.10% *employee* deduction on all OR wages.
- **Paid Leave Oregon:** 1.00% on wages; employers with ≥25 employees split 40% employer / 60% employee.
- **OregonSaves** retirement mandate phased in 2020-2023 for all employers without a qualified plan.

### 5.8 Colorado — FAMLI

- **FAMLI:** 0.90% on wages up to SS base; 50/50 employer/employee split for employers with ≥10 employees; employee-only for employers <10.
- **CO SecureSavings** retirement mandate for employers with 5+ employees since 12/31/2023.

### 5.9 Illinois — Secure Choice + Chicago

- **IL Secure Choice** mandate: 5+ employees, no qualified plan → must register and facilitate Roth IRA contributions.
- **Chicago Paid Leave & Paid Sick Leave** ordinance (effective 7/1/2024) layers on top of IL state ESST.
- IL is flat 4.95% so withholding tables are simple, but local-equivalent obligations (transit fund, expense reimbursement under IL Wage Payment Act §9.5) are easy to miss.

### 5.10 Massachusetts — PFML

- **MA PFML 0.88%:** the only state-administered combined medical + family leave with employer/employee split that varies by employer size. Employers <25 EE pay 0.18% (employee-only for medical portion); ≥25 EE pay full 0.88% with employer covering 60% of medical / 0% of family.
- The 4% surtax on income >$1M (the "Millionaires Tax," Article 44) means high earners need additional withholding via Form M-4.

## 6. AUDIT FLASH POINTS — multi-state remote workers

The convenience-of-employer rule (also called the "convenience of the employer" rule or COE rule) is the single largest audit flash point for multi-state employers in 2024-2025:

| State | Authority | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| New York | TSB-M-06(5)I | Wages of NY-based employer's remote employee sourced to NY unless employer requires the out-of-state location |
| New Jersey | Adopted 2023 (P.L. 2023, c.125) — limited reciprocal application against NY | Reverse convenience rule that sources to NJ in mirror situations |
| Connecticut | Conn. Gen. Stat. §12-711(b)(2)(C) | COE applies when nonresident works for CT employer |
| Pennsylvania | 61 Pa. Code §109.8 | COE rule for PA-employer non-resident remote workers |
| Nebraska | Nebraska Reg-22-003.01C | COE rule applies |
| Arkansas | Reg. §1.26-51-202 | COE rule applies |
| Delaware | 30 Del. C. §1124 (interpretation) | COE rule applies |

**Practical guidance:** when a client has a remote employee residing outside a COE-rule state but employed by a company headquartered in one of these seven states, withholding *both* states' PIT may be required, with the employee filing for credit. The default conservative position is to withhold for the COE state plus the residence state until the employee files for an exemption.
