# US Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (Form 2555) — Tax Year 2025

## 1. Scope

This skill prepares the §911 Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the §911(c) Foreign Housing Exclusion or Deduction for tax year 2025 filings by:

- US citizens (any age, any state of last residence) living and working outside the United States.
- US lawful permanent residents (green card holders) who meet one of the qualifying tests AND have not surrendered residency (Form I-407).
- Sole proprietors and single-member LLCs disregarded for federal tax operating abroad.
- W-2 employees of foreign employers, US employers operating abroad, and foreign subsidiaries of US multinationals.

In scope for this skill:

- Form 2555 preparation in its entirety (Parts I–IX).
- The Bona Fide Residence Test under IRC §911(d)(1)(A).
- The Physical Presence Test under IRC §911(d)(1)(B) including the 12-month-window optimisation.
- The "tax home in a foreign country" requirement under §911(d)(3).
- The 2025 FEIE cap and indexing methodology.
- The §911(c) housing exclusion (employer-paid) and housing deduction (self-employed).
- The IRS Notice updating high-cost-locality housing caps (the annual successor to Notice 2024-44).
- The stacked tax computation under §911(f) — the "anti-bracket-cliff" mechanic.
- The §911(e) election, the 5-year revocation lockout, and how to re-elect with IRS consent.
- The strategic choice between FEIE and the Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116), including the "carve-out" planning approach.
- The Self-Employment tax trap — FEIE excludes income tax but NOT the 15.3% SE tax under §1402.
- Cross-references to totalization agreements (refer-out only).
- The §6072(c) automatic 2-month filing extension to June 15 for taxpayers abroad.

Out of scope (refer out, do not attempt):

- US citizens and bona fide residents of Puerto Rico (§933 — different regime entirely; refer to a PR specialist).
- The detailed computation of foreign tax credits under §901–§905 (refer to a Form 1116 skill).
- FBAR (FinCEN Form 114) and Form 8938 disclosure (refer to the foreign-asset-disclosure workstream).
- PFIC (Form 8621), CFC (Form 5471), GILTI (Form 8992), and foreign trust (Form 3520/3520-A) reporting.
- Treaty residency tie-breaker analysis where dual residency is contested.
- Expatriation tax under §877A and Form 8854.
- Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures and OVDP.
- State residency severance for US-state taxation while abroad (California, New York, Virginia in particular).
- Computation of the totalization agreement Certificate of Coverage process at the foreign social-security agency level (refer to the foreign-payroll specialist).
- Roth conversions, RMD planning, NIIT and additional Medicare while abroad — handled by other skills.
- Cryptocurrency staking or mining income earned abroad — separate workstream.

Every output must go to a Circular 230 reviewer (EA, CPA, or attorney) before reaching the client. The reviewer must independently confirm: (a) the 12-month window for the Physical Presence Test, (b) the housing-cap locality lookup, (c) the SE-tax exposure, (d) the §911 election history, and (e) the FTC interaction.

## 2. The US Worldwide Taxation Principle

The starting principle a non-tax professional rarely appreciates: the United States is one of only two countries in the world that taxes its citizens on worldwide income regardless of where they live (the other is Eritrea). Every other country uses some form of residence-based taxation.

Consequences:

- A US citizen who has never lived in the United States ("Accidental American") still owes US tax on global income and must file Form 1040 annually if income exceeds the standard filing threshold for their filing status.
- A US citizen who emigrates to Dubai and earns AED 800,000 working for a Dubai employer still owes US tax on that compensation — UAE has no income tax, but the US does, on its citizens, everywhere.
- The remedy is partial: the FEIE excludes a capped amount, and the Foreign Tax Credit relieves double taxation where the foreign country DOES tax the income.
- Green card holders are treated as US tax residents for the entire calendar year unless they formally surrender the green card by filing Form I-407. Simply leaving the US does not stop the green card holder's US tax obligations.

This principle frames every conversation. The taxpayer's first instinct ("I don't live in the US, why am I filing?") is wrong. The correct framing is: "You file every year. The question is how much of the income you can exclude or credit."

§911 is the most generous of the relief mechanisms for earned income. It is not, however, a substitute for filing — the FEIE is claimed ON a Form 1040 and computed ON a Form 2555. Failure to file means no FEIE; the IRS can disallow the §911 election retroactively if the return is filed late enough (generally outside the §911(d)(8) "timely-filed-with-extensions plus reasonable cause" window).

## 3. The 2025 FEIE Cap

The maximum foreign earned income that can be excluded for tax year 2025 is **$130,000** per qualifying individual. This is the Rev. Proc. 2024-40 inflation-adjusted figure (the IRS publishes the annual indexed amount each fall in the inflation Rev. Proc.). For comparison:

- 2024: $126,500
- 2023: $120,000
- 2022: $112,000
- 2021: $108,700

Notes on the cap:

- The cap is per qualifying individual, not per couple. A married couple where both spouses qualify independently can each claim up to $130,000, for a combined exclusion of $260,000.
- The cap is prorated by qualifying days when the taxpayer is a qualifying individual for less than the full year. A taxpayer who qualifies under the Physical Presence Test for a 12-month window that overlaps tax year 2025 by 200 days is limited to $130,000 × (200 / 365) = $71,233 of FEIE for 2025.
- The proration uses 365 days for the denominator (the IRS Form 2555 instructions specify "days in the year" — 366 in a leap year).
- The exclusion applies to foreign earned income ONLY (see Section 7). Investment income, pension income, and US-source income are never excludable.
- The cap interacts with the housing exclusion/deduction — together they cannot exceed foreign earned income, and the housing-cap formula uses the FEIE cap as its base (see Section 10).

Reviewer must verify the 2025 figure against the IRS Form 2555 instructions when they are released (typically December 2025 or January 2026). If the published figure differs from $130,000, the reviewer overrides this skill.

## 4. The Bona Fide Residence Test (§911(d)(1)(A))

A US citizen (the test is NOT available to green card holders unless they are also nationals of a country with a US tax treaty containing a non-discrimination clause — narrow exception) qualifies if:

> The taxpayer is a bona fide resident of a foreign country, or countries, for an uninterrupted period that includes an entire taxable year.

Key elements:

- **Entire taxable year**: for a calendar-year taxpayer, this means January 1 through December 31. The taxpayer must be a bona fide resident for the entire calendar year. Once the test is met in Year 1 (the establishment year), it can be back-dated for portions of Year 0 and continue into Year 2 even if the taxpayer departs partway through.
- **Bona fide**: a facts-and-circumstances inquiry, not a day count. The IRS and the Tax Court look at:
  - Stated intent (does the taxpayer say "I live in country X indefinitely" or "I'm here on a 14-month assignment"?)
  - Length of stay and pattern of trips back to the US.
  - Family ties (spouse and children in the foreign country vs. left behind in the US).
  - Type of accommodation (long-term leased apartment vs. hotel suite).
  - Local social and economic integration (foreign bank account, local driver's license, foreign tax-resident filing).
  - Whether the taxpayer has filed a tax return as a non-resident of the foreign country (Form 2555-style — IRS Rev. Rul. 75-84 disqualifies a taxpayer who claims non-residence to the foreign tax authority to escape foreign tax).
  - Nature of the work (indefinite vs. temporary assignment).
- **Uninterrupted**: brief and temporary trips to the US do not break bona fide residence. Long absences or return-to-US-for-residential-reasons absences do.

Practical patterns:

- A US citizen who moved to London in March 2024 and has lived there continuously since, with a UK long-term residential lease, UK tax filings as a UK tax resident, family in London, and only occasional US business trips, qualifies as a bona fide resident for tax year 2025 (and likely retroactively for the portion of 2024 after March, once the 2025 establishment year is met).
- A US citizen on a 9-month assignment in Tokyo who returns to the US each summer does NOT qualify under bona fide residence (no intent of indefinite residence; assignment is temporary).
- A digital nomad rotating between Bali, Mexico City, and Lisbon every 3 months does NOT qualify under bona fide residence (no bona fide residence in any one country). The Physical Presence Test is the appropriate alternative.

Statement requirement: Part II of Form 2555 asks for a statement to the foreign country's tax authority that the taxpayer is NOT a resident there. If the taxpayer made such a statement, bona fide residence is disqualified (Rev. Rul. 75-84). Capture this on intake.

## 5. The Physical Presence Test (§911(d)(1)(B))

A US citizen OR green card holder qualifies if:

> The taxpayer is present in a foreign country or countries during at least 330 full days during any 12 consecutive months.

Key elements:

- **330 full days**: a "full day" is a 24-hour period (midnight to midnight) entirely spent in a foreign country. Partial days (arrival day, departure day, days in international waters or international airspace) do NOT count.
- **In a foreign country**: the territorial waters and airspace of a foreign country count; the Antarctic and international waters do not. A day at sea in international waters between two foreign ports is NOT a foreign-country day.
- **12 consecutive months**: the window is taxpayer-chosen, can begin on any day, and need not align with the calendar year. This is the planning lever.
- **Travel to the US**: any day the taxpayer is physically in the US, including arriving or departing, breaks the 330-day count for that day. Even a 30-minute layover at a US airport while transiting kills the day.
- **Sickness, vacation, or non-work days abroad**: all count as foreign-country days as long as the 24-hour-midnight-to-midnight test is met.

### 5.1 The 12-Month Window Strategy

Because the 12-month window is taxpayer-chosen, a first-year expat or a returning expat can often "straddle" two tax years to qualify for FEIE in both:

Example: a taxpayer moves to Dubai on March 15, 2024 and plans to stay through August 31, 2025.

- Days abroad: March 16, 2024 through August 30, 2025 = approximately 532 days.
- Of those, 35 days are US business trips (combined). Net foreign-country full days: ~497.
- The taxpayer can choose any 12-month window that contains 330 full foreign-country days.
- A March 16, 2024 → March 15, 2025 window contains roughly 330 full days (if US trips were sparse). This qualifies the taxpayer for FEIE on the 2024 return for the portion of 2024 within the window (March 16 – December 31, 2024 = 291 days). 2024 FEIE prorated: $126,500 × 291 / 366 = $100,562.
- A separate September 1, 2024 → August 31, 2025 window also contains 330 days. This qualifies the taxpayer for FEIE on the 2025 return for the portion of 2025 within the window (January 1 – August 31, 2025 = 243 days). 2025 FEIE prorated: $130,000 × 243 / 365 = $86,548.
- The two windows do NOT need to be non-overlapping. They are separately applied to two separate tax years.

This straddling is the most important practical move for first-year expats and is responsible for thousands of dollars of additional exclusion when handled correctly.

### 5.2 Day-Counting Discipline

Reviewer must see, for the chosen window:

- A day-by-day or trip-by-trip log of every US-day during the window.
- A column showing "qualifying" for each day (yes/no).
- A running 330-day tally.
- Documentation of arrival and departure dates (passport stamps, airline tickets, boarding passes).

Form 2555 Part III, line 18 asks for the dates the taxpayer was present in the US during the window — this must reconcile to the log. Misreporting US days is the most common audit finding on FEIE returns.

### 5.3 Waiver of Time Requirements for War, Civil Unrest, Pandemic

Under §911(d)(4), the IRS may waive the time requirement for taxpayers who must leave a country due to war, civil unrest, or similar adverse conditions. The IRS publishes an annual list of waiver countries in a Rev. Proc. Recent examples have included Ukraine (2022 onward), Sudan, Ethiopia, Iraq, and during the COVID-19 emergency, a broad pandemic-related waiver. Reviewer must check whether a waiver applies before disqualifying a taxpayer who is short of 330 days due to evacuation.

## 6. The Tax Home Requirement (§911(d)(3))

A separate, parallel requirement: the taxpayer's "tax home" must be in a foreign country during the qualifying period.

- "Tax home" generally means the location of the taxpayer's regular or principal place of business.
- If the taxpayer's abode (personal residence, family, social ties) remains in the United States, the tax home is in the US — even if the taxpayer works abroad. The §911 election is then unavailable.
- The Tax Court has consistently applied this in cases involving offshore oil-rig workers who maintained US homes (Tax Court denied §911 because the abode was in the US).
- A digital nomad with no fixed business location may struggle to establish a foreign tax home. The IRS may argue the tax home is "itinerant" — neither US nor foreign — and disallow §911.

The reviewer must affirmatively confirm tax home in a foreign country on intake. A useful test: where is the taxpayer's primary residence, family, bank accounts, gym membership, driver's license, mailing address for personal correspondence? If most or all are foreign, tax home is foreign.

## 7. Definition of Foreign Earned Income

§911(b)(1) defines foreign earned income as:

> The amount received by such individual from sources within a foreign country or countries which constitute earned income attributable to services performed by such individual during the period [of qualifying foreign residence/presence].

Inclusions:

- Wages, salary, professional fees, commissions, tips, bonuses, allowances earned for services performed in a foreign country.
- Compensation paid by a foreign employer, US employer abroad, foreign subsidiary, or foreign branch.
- Net earnings of a self-employed taxpayer (Schedule C net profit, partnership Schedule K-1 earned income, etc.) for services performed in a foreign country.
- Reasonable compensation for personal services rendered abroad, even if paid in the US or to a US bank account (source is where the services are performed, not where the payment is received).
- Allowances for housing, education, cost-of-living differentials, hardship duty, etc. — these are foreign earned income (subject to housing exclusion treatment for the housing portion).

Exclusions (NEVER foreign earned income, regardless of where earned):

- Investment income: interest, dividends, capital gains, royalties (unless connected with the active conduct of a trade or business).
- Rental income (passive — Schedule E).
- Pension or annuity distributions, including from foreign pensions.
- Social Security benefits.
- Amounts received as an employee of the US government or any agency or instrumentality thereof (§911(b)(1)(B)(ii)).
- Military pay (active duty US armed forces — separate combat-zone exclusion under §112 may apply).
- Amounts received more than one year after the close of the tax year in which the services were performed (§911(b)(1)(B)(iv) — late-paid compensation cap).
- Disallowed deductions and recharacterizations — e.g., S corporation distributions in excess of reasonable compensation are not earned income.

Sourcing rule: compensation is sourced where the services are performed. A US citizen who lives in Lisbon, performs all programming work in Lisbon, and is paid by a US client to a US bank account, has Lisbon-source earned income — qualifying for FEIE. A US citizen who lives in Lisbon but flies to Boston for 60 days of in-person consulting earns Lisbon-source income for the 305 Lisbon days and US-source for the 60 Boston days. The 60-day Boston earnings are NOT FEIE-eligible.

Allocation: where services are performed partly inside and partly outside the US, allocate by workdays (Form 2555 Part IV uses a workday-allocation methodology).

## 8. The Self-Employment Tax Trap

This is the single most consequential drafting error for self-employed expats.

§911 excludes foreign earned income from **gross income for income tax purposes**. It does NOT exclude the income from net earnings from self-employment under §1402(a). Schedule SE is computed on the FULL Schedule C net profit before any FEIE.

Consequences:

- A US citizen freelance developer in Dubai with $130,000 of Schedule C net profit pays $0 federal income tax (fully excluded under FEIE) but owes $18,365 of SE tax: $130,000 × 0.9235 × 0.153 = $18,365 (approximately).
- This is permanent. There is no way to exclude the SE tax under §911. The SE tax is calculated and paid as if no FEIE election existed.
- Many expats do not realize this until their first return is prepared. Set expectations on intake: "FEIE is an INCOME tax relief. The 15.3% SE tax is separate and still due."

### 8.1 Totalization Agreement Workaround

The US has bilateral totalization agreements with 30 countries (as of 2025): Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Uruguay.

If the taxpayer is genuinely paying foreign social security on the same income (Germany Rentenversicherung, UK National Insurance, France SECU, Portugal Segurança Social, etc.) AND the foreign country is on the totalization list, the taxpayer can obtain a Certificate of Coverage from the FOREIGN agency proving foreign coverage. Attached to the US return, this exempts the taxpayer from US SE tax on the same earnings.

- The Certificate of Coverage is issued by the foreign social-security agency, NOT the IRS or SSA.
- The taxpayer files the US return with the Certificate of Coverage as a paper attachment and a statement on Schedule SE indicating "Exempt — totalization agreement with [country]" instead of computing SE tax.
- Countries NOT on the list (Dubai/UAE, Singapore, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, Cayman, BVI, Bermuda, most of Latin America, most of Africa, most of Asia except Japan/Korea/Chile/Uruguay/Brazil) do NOT allow exemption. SE tax is owed in full.
- This skill refers all Certificate of Coverage workstreams to the foreign-payroll specialist. Note the exposure on the reviewer brief but do not attempt to file the certificate.

### 8.2 Practical SE-tax Examples

- Dubai-based US-citizen freelancer earning $200,000 Schedule C: FEIE excludes $130,000 of income tax; SE tax on full $200,000 × 0.9235 × 0.153 (with the Social Security wage base of $176,100 in 2025 limiting OASDI) is approximately $24,000. UAE not on totalization list — no relief.
- Berlin-based US-citizen freelancer earning $130,000 Schedule C, paying German Rentenversicherung 18.6% on the same earnings: FEIE excludes income tax in full; SE tax is exempted via German Certificate of Coverage. Net US federal tax: $0. (German tax of course owed separately.)

Capture totalization status on intake.

## 9. Foreign Housing Exclusion vs Foreign Housing Deduction

§911(c) provides relief for housing costs above a "base housing amount" up to a "cap." Two parallel mechanisms:

- **Foreign Housing Exclusion** — for employees whose housing is paid by an employer (i.e., the housing benefit is included in foreign earned income). The exclusion reduces the income amount taxable to the employee.
- **Foreign Housing Deduction** — for self-employed taxpayers who pay their own housing costs. The deduction is an above-the-line adjustment on Schedule 1.

A taxpayer with both employee and self-employed income allocates housing costs proportionally between exclusion and deduction.

### 9.1 The Base and Cap

For 2025:

- **Base housing amount**: 16% × FEIE cap × qualifying days / 365 = 16% × $130,000 × (qualifying days / 365) = $20,800 × (qualifying days / 365) for a full year. (Note: Form 2555 instructions use "16% × FEIE cap" — verify in the official 2025 instructions; the figure rounds to roughly $21,600 in some interpretations including the prior-year inflation method; reviewer to verify.)
- **General cap**: 30% × FEIE cap × qualifying days / 365 = 30% × $130,000 × (qualifying days / 365) = $39,000 for a full year.
- **High-cost locality cap**: the IRS publishes an annual Notice (successor to Notice 2024-44 for 2024 tax year) listing higher caps for designated high-cost cities. For tax year 2024, examples included Hong Kong ($114,300), Singapore ($88,200), Tokyo ($66,500), Geneva ($107,400), Paris ($73,100), London ($67,800), Dubai ($57,413), Moscow ($73,600), and others. The 2025 Notice (typically released spring 2025) will update these figures; reviewer must look up the specific city.

### 9.2 The Housing Cost Definition

§911(c)(3) defines housing expenses to include:

- Rent (residential).
- Reasonable utilities (excluding telephone).
- Real and personal property insurance.
- Occupancy taxes.
- Non-deductible rental security deposit lost.
- Furniture rental.
- Residential parking.
- Repairs.
- Household repairs.

NOT included:

- Purchase price or principal payments on a purchased home (mortgage interest is treated differently — see §911(c)(3)(B); it is deductible elsewhere).
- Improvements that increase basis.
- Domestic help (maid, gardener, nanny).
- TV subscription, telephone, internet, cable.
- Furniture purchases.
- Depreciation on owned home.

For a US citizen owning a home abroad, only the "operating" expenses (utilities, insurance, taxes, repairs) and mortgage interest qualify — and even mortgage interest is treated via a complicated separate mechanism. Renters have the cleaner case.

### 9.3 Spousal Housing

If both spouses qualify for §911 and share the same household, only ONE spouse may claim the housing exclusion/deduction (not both — the IRS treats it as a household-level cost). Couples should allocate the housing claim to the higher-income spouse to maximize the cap utilization.

### 9.4 The Final Cap Test

Housing exclusion/deduction = MIN(actual housing costs minus base, cap minus base) × qualifying days/365.

Worked example, taxpayer single, lived in Singapore all of 2025:

- Actual housing costs (rent + utilities + insurance + parking): $90,000.
- Base housing amount: 16% × $130,000 = $20,800.
- Singapore cap (2025 — verify in successor Notice): assume $90,000 for illustration.
- Excess over base: $90,000 − $20,800 = $69,200.
- Cap over base: $90,000 − $20,800 = $69,200.
- Housing exclusion = $69,200.

Combined with FEIE of $130,000 = $199,200 total exclusion. Taxpayer's salary of $250,000 leaves $50,800 taxable in the US (offset by FTC if Singapore tax was paid).

## 10. Form 2555 Walkthrough

Form 2555 has nine parts. Each maps to specific tax-law concepts. The skill produces the following deliverables for each return:

### Part I — General Information

- Line 1: Foreign address.
- Line 2: Occupation.

- Line 10: Brief description of trade/business.

### Part II — Bona Fide Residence Test (if elected)

- Line 11: Period of bona fide residence.

The deliverable to the reviewer is the completed Form 2555, a worksheet showing the day count for Physical Presence Test (if used), a housing-cost worksheet (with line-item rent, utilities, parking, etc.), a reconciliation of total foreign earned income to Schedule C / W-2 / K-1 inputs, and the §911(f) stacked-tax worksheet (see Section 11).

## 11. The Stacked Tax Computation under §911(f)

Pre-2006 law: a taxpayer with $200,000 of income and $80,000 of FEIE was taxed on the remaining $120,000 starting at the 10% bracket — the FEIE essentially gave a "windfall" of low brackets.

§911(f), enacted in 2006, closed this:

> Tax = (Tax computed on TOTAL income including excluded amount) − (Tax computed on excluded amount alone, using same brackets).

This is called the "stacked" method. It ensures non-excluded income is taxed at the marginal rate it would have faced without the FEIE.

### 11.1 Worked Mechanic

Single filer, 2025, $250,000 foreign salary, $130,000 FEIE, no other income:

- Step 1: Compute tax on $250,000 using 2025 single brackets:
  - 10% on first $11,925 = $1,192.50
  - 12% on $11,925–$48,475 = $4,386.00
  - 22% on $48,475–$103,350 = $12,072.50
  - 24% on $103,350–$197,300 = $22,548.00
  - 32% on $197,300–$250,525 ≈ $16,896.00 (for the $52,700 in this band — note: only $52,700 of the $250,000 enters the 32% band, since the 35% band starts at $250,525)
  - Actually compute on $250,000: 24% applies to $103,350–$197,300 portion, then $52,700 in the 32% band.
  - Tax ≈ $1,193 + $4,386 + $12,073 + $22,548 + $16,864 = approximately $57,063.
- Step 2: Compute tax on $130,000 (the excluded amount) using same brackets:
  - 10% on $11,925 = $1,192.50
  - 12% on $11,925–$48,475 = $4,386.00
  - 22% on $48,475–$103,350 = $12,072.50
  - 24% on $103,350–$130,000 = $6,396.00
  - Tax ≈ $24,047.
- Step 3: Net tax = $57,063 − $24,047 = $33,016.

Compare to pre-§911(f) "shelf" method: $250,000 − $130,000 = $120,000 taxable; tax on $120,000 = $1,193 + $4,386 + $12,073 + $4,002 = $21,654. The stacked method costs the taxpayer roughly $11,362 more, by design.

### 11.2 The Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet

The worksheet implementing §911(f) is in the Form 1040 instructions (the "Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet"). Every Form 2555 filer with non-zero taxable income after FEIE must use this worksheet rather than the standard Tax Computation Worksheet or Tax Tables. The reviewer brief shows the worksheet output.

Software automation note: most tax software handles this correctly. Hand-prepared returns often miss it — common audit finding.

### 11.3 Interaction with Other Brackets

§911(f) also applies to the AMT computation, the qualified dividends/long-term capital gains rate computation (28% rate gain, unrecaptured §1250 gain), the NIIT under §1411, and the Additional Medicare Tax under §3101(b)(2). For each, the taxpayer must include the excluded income for purposes of determining brackets and thresholds, then subtract the tax associated with the excluded amount.

## 12. Election and Revocation Under §911(e)

§911 is an ELECTION. It is not automatic. The election is made by filing Form 2555 (or Form 2555-EZ, abolished after 2018) with a timely-filed (including extensions) return for the first year for which the election is to apply.

### 12.1 Once Made, Continues

Once the §911(e) election is made, it CONTINUES in effect for ALL subsequent years until the taxpayer revokes it. The taxpayer does not re-elect each year; rather, the taxpayer continues to file Form 2555 each year showing the qualifying status.

### 12.2 Revocation

Revocation is by attached statement to a timely-filed return for the year in which the revocation is to apply. Once revoked, the taxpayer CANNOT re-elect for 5 tax years without the IRS's consent (a Private Letter Ruling under §911(e)(2)).

### 12.3 Practical Trap

- Year 1: Taxpayer files Form 2555, claims FEIE. Election made.
- Year 2: Taxpayer's situation changes (e.g., moves to high-tax country where FTC is better). Taxpayer files WITHOUT Form 2555.
- Year 3: Taxpayer's situation reverts. Taxpayer files WITH Form 2555.

In this scenario, the IRS may treat the Year 2 omission as a revocation. If so, the Year 3 re-election is invalid (within 5-year lockout), and FEIE is disallowed.

The safe practice: each year the taxpayer is abroad, file Form 2555 even if the FEIE computes to $0 (because, e.g., it would have been more beneficial to use FTC). This preserves the election by showing it remains in effect. Alternatively, file a statement at the bottom of the return "Election under §911(e) remains in effect; FEIE not claimed for tax year [X] due to election to use FTC; taxpayer does not revoke §911 election."

Reviewer must confirm election history on intake. If the taxpayer was abroad in prior years and did not file Form 2555, the IRS may treat the current election as a "new" election subject to consent.

## 13. FEIE vs Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116) — Strategic Choice

The biggest planning decision for most expats. Both mechanisms relieve double taxation; they cannot both apply to the same dollar of income.

### 13.1 The Mechanics Briefly

- **§911 FEIE**: excludes up to $130,000 of foreign earned income from US gross income. Income outside the cap is taxed in the US starting at the §911(f) stacked rate. Housing exclusion adds more relief.
- **§901 Foreign Tax Credit (Form 1116)**: includes all foreign income in US gross income but provides a dollar-for-dollar credit against US tax for foreign income tax actually paid on the same income, limited to the US tax on the foreign-source portion (the "FTC limitation" under §904).

### 13.2 The Rule of Thumb

- Low-foreign-tax country (UAE, Singapore, Hong Kong, Cayman, BVI, Bermuda): §911 FEIE generally beats FTC because there is little or no foreign tax to credit.
- High-foreign-tax country (Germany ~45%, UK ~45%, France ~45%, Sweden ~52%, Australia ~45%): FTC generally beats §911 because the foreign tax credit fully eliminates US income tax and even produces "excess" credits that carry forward. Plus, using FTC preserves more US tax basis for retirement contributions and other purposes.
- Medium-foreign-tax country (Spain, Italy, Netherlands): often a hybrid — §911 on the first $130k + FTC on the rest. Requires careful modelling.

### 13.3 The Carve-Out

A taxpayer earning, say, $250,000 in Berlin paying German tax of $115,000 (46% effective) can:

- Claim §911 FEIE on first $130,000 (US tax on this portion = $0).
- Claim FTC on the remaining $120,000.
- US tax on the $120,000 stacked = approximately $33,016 (per Section 11).
- German tax allocated to that $120,000 = approximately $55,200 ($115,000 × 120/250).
- FTC = MIN($55,200, $33,016) = $33,016.
- Net US tax = $0.
- Excess FTC = $22,184 carried forward 10 years.

Alternatively, NO §911 (FTC only):

- Full $250,000 in US gross income.
- US tax ≈ $57,063.
- FTC = MIN($115,000, $57,063) = $57,063.
- Net US tax = $0.
- Excess FTC = $57,937 carried forward 10 years.

Both produce $0 net US tax for 2025. The FTC-only approach generates MORE carryforward — which has value if the taxpayer expects future US-source income (e.g., a return to the US, or US-source consulting). The §911-plus-FTC carve-out generates less carryforward but preserves the §911 election.

### 13.4 Other Factors

- §911 reduces AGI, which can reduce phase-outs (e.g., student loan interest, Roth IRA contributions, child tax credit, certain education credits).
- §911 reduces earned income for IRA/Roth contribution purposes — taxpayers using FEIE may have NO eligible compensation for Roth IRA contributions if FEIE fully excludes their earned income (compensation for IRA purposes is reduced by §911 exclusion under §219(c) and Treas. Reg. §1.219-1(c)(4)).
- §911 affects QBI computation (excluded income is NOT included in QBI under §199A(c)(3)(A)(i)).
- FTC carryback is 1 year and carryforward is 10 years (§904(c)).
- Self-employed taxpayers should evaluate whether using FTC instead of §911 (or in combination) affects the Schedule SE-tax bottom line. (§911 does NOT reduce SE tax; FTC does NOT reduce SE tax either. Neither path affects SE tax.)
- The taxpayer's spouse: if one spouse uses §911 and the other uses FTC, the rules become tangled — reviewer should model both scenarios.

The skill produces a side-by-side comparison on the reviewer brief.

## 14. Filing Mechanics

### 14.1 The §6072(c) Automatic 2-Month Extension

US citizens and residents who are abroad on the regular due date (April 15, 2026 for tax year 2025) get an automatic 2-month extension to **June 15, 2026** WITHOUT filing any form. The taxpayer attaches a statement to the return saying "Taxpayer was abroad on April 15; §6072(c) automatic extension applies."

This is not an extension to pay — only to file. Interest accrues on any balance due from April 15.

### 14.2 The Additional Form 4868 Extension to October 15

Filing Form 4868 by April 15 (or by June 15 for those using §6072(c)) extends the filing deadline to October 15, 2026. Filed-from-abroad returns commonly use this for time to compile foreign payroll, foreign tax assessments, and bank records.

### 14.3 The December 15 Special Extension

A taxpayer abroad who needs MORE time beyond October 15 can request a discretionary extension to December 15 by letter to the IRS Service Center. This is a request, not a right — the IRS grants it where reasonable.

### 14.4 Form 2350 — Special FEIE Extension

A taxpayer who has not yet met the qualifying-period requirement by the regular due date (e.g., a Physical Presence Test 12-month window that ends after April 15) can file Form 2350 to extend the filing deadline until 30 days after the qualifying period ends. This is critical for first-year expats.

### 14.5 E-Filing

Form 2555 is fully e-fileable through major tax software (TurboTax, Drake, ProConnect, Lacerte, ATX, etc.). The 12-month window data, US-day log, and housing-cost worksheets must be inputted; the software generates the form and the §911(f) worksheet. Reviewer must verify the §911(f) worksheet output rather than trusting the bottom-line number.

### 14.6 Estimated Taxes

US citizens abroad still owe quarterly estimated taxes (Form 1040-ES) under §6654, including the SE-tax portion. The §6072(c) extension applies only to the annual return, not estimated payments. Most expats miss this — set up Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4 reminders.

## 15. Worked Examples

### 15.1 Example A — W-2 Employee in Dubai

**Taxpayer**: Sarah, age 35, single, US citizen, full year 2025 in Dubai working for a UAE company. Salary AED 750,000 (USD ~$204,000). Employer-provided housing of $60,000/yr. No US-source income. UAE: 0% income tax.

**Test**: Physical Presence (lived continuously in Dubai 1 Jan – 31 Dec 2025; 12-month window = calendar year 2025; 365 full days in UAE — well over 330).

**Foreign earned income**: $204,000 wages + $60,000 housing benefit = $264,000.

**FEIE**: $130,000 (full year qualifying).

**Housing exclusion**:
- Base: 16% × $130,000 = $20,800.
- Cap: Dubai is on the IRS high-cost-locality list. Assume 2025 cap = $58,400 (verify in successor to Notice 2024-44).
- Actual housing: $60,000.
- Housing exclusion = MIN($60,000 − $20,800, $58,400 − $20,800) = MIN($39,200, $37,600) = $37,600.

**Total exclusion**: $130,000 + $37,600 = $167,600.

**Taxable income**: $264,000 − $167,600 = $96,400 − $14,600 standard deduction (2025 single) = $81,800.

**§911(f) stacked tax** (on $81,800 + $167,600 = $249,400 reported "as if"):
- Tax on $249,400 ≈ $56,872.
- Tax on $167,600 ≈ $32,460.
- Net US tax = $56,872 − $32,460 = $24,412.

**Foreign tax credit**: $0 (UAE collected no tax).

**SE tax**: $0 (W-2 employee, not self-employed).

**Net US federal tax owed**: $24,412.

**Compare without FEIE**: Tax on $204,000 + $60,000 − $14,600 = $249,400 = $56,872. Far worse. §911 saves $32,460.

### 15.2 Example B — Freelance US Citizen in Lisbon Using FTC + NHR

**Taxpayer**: David, age 42, married filing separately, US citizen, full year 2025 in Lisbon, Portugal under the Non-Habitual Resident (NHR) regime (legacy regime; assume he qualified before 2024 cutoff). Schedule C net profit: $180,000. Portuguese tax under NHR on foreign-source professional income (treated as foreign even though performed in Portugal under the NHR special rules): 20% flat = $36,000.

**Test**: Bona Fide Residence (Portuguese tax resident since 2023, NHR registered, long-term apartment lease).

**Decision**: §911 vs FTC?

**§911 path**:
- FEIE: $130,000.
- Schedule C taxable in US after FEIE: $50,000.
- §911(f) stacked tax on $50,000 — $14,600 SD = $35,400: roughly $4,000.
- FTC on the $50,000 (Portuguese tax allocated: $36,000 × 50/180 = $10,000): FTC = MIN($10,000, $4,000) = $4,000. Net US income tax = $0.
- SE tax: Portugal IS on totalization list. If David has a Certificate of Coverage from Portuguese Segurança Social, SE tax = $0. Otherwise SE tax = $180,000 × 0.9235 × 0.153 = ~$25,447.

**FTC-only path**:
- Full $180,000 in US gross income.
- Taxable: $180,000 − $14,600 = $165,400.
- Tax ≈ $33,000.
- FTC = MIN($36,000, $33,000) = $33,000. Net US income tax = $0.
- Excess FTC carryforward: $3,000 (10 years).
- SE tax: same as above; not affected by FTC vs §911.

**Recommendation**: For David, FTC-only is slightly better because (a) generates $3,000 of carryforward, (b) preserves Roth IRA / IRA contribution eligibility (compensation is not reduced by §911 exclusion), (c) keeps QBI deduction available on full $180,000 Schedule C net profit (§911 would exclude $130,000 from QBI base), (d) avoids the §911 election lockout if David ever wants to relocate to a high-cost city in the future.

**Caveat**: David should still file Form 2555 to preserve the §911 election history if he has filed it in prior years. Statement: "FEIE election under §911(e) remains in effect; FEIE not claimed for tax year 2025 due to election to use FTC."

### 15.3 Example C — US Citizen in Singapore Using §911 + High-Cost Housing

**Taxpayer**: Priya, age 38, single, US citizen, full year 2025 in Singapore working for a Singapore subsidiary of a US multinational. Salary SGD 350,000 (USD ~$260,000). Pays Singapore income tax of ~$31,000 (effective 12%). Employer-provided housing of $108,000/yr (very common in Singapore where housing is expensive).

**Test**: Bona Fide Residence (lived in Singapore 4+ years, permanent residence visa, family there).

**Foreign earned income**: $260,000 + $108,000 = $368,000.

**FEIE**: $130,000.

**Housing exclusion**:
- Base: 16% × $130,000 = $20,800.
- Singapore 2025 cap: assume $90,000 (Singapore is one of the highest-listed cities; verify in successor to Notice 2024-44).
- Actual housing: $108,000.
- Housing exclusion = MIN($108,000 − $20,800, $90,000 − $20,800) = MIN($87,200, $69,200) = $69,200.

**Total exclusion**: $130,000 + $69,200 = $199,200.

**Taxable**: $368,000 − $199,200 = $168,800; minus $14,600 SD = $154,200.

**§911(f) stacked tax** (computed on $154,200 + $199,200 = $353,400):
- Tax on $353,400 (single 2025) — well into the 35% bracket: approximately $89,000.
- Tax on $199,200: $1,193 + $4,386 + $12,073 + $22,548 + $640 (small piece in 32%) ≈ $40,840.
- Net US income tax = $89,000 − $40,840 = $48,160.

**FTC on remaining**: Singapore tax of $31,000 allocated to the $130,000 in non-FEIE foreign earned income (it's tricky — the allocation rules under §904 are complex; assume an allocation of $11,000 to the unexcluded portion as a rough approximation, reviewer to verify). FTC = MIN($11,000, $48,160) = $11,000.

**Net US tax owed**: $48,160 − $11,000 = $37,160.

**SE tax**: $0 (W-2 employee).

**Decision**: §911 + high-cost housing exclusion + partial FTC is the right combination. Pure FTC would not absorb US tax fully because Singapore's effective rate is low; FTC = $31,000 vs full US tax on $368,000 of approximately $95,000. Net US tax under FTC-only ≈ $64,000 — worse than §911 + FTC carve-out by $26,000.

## 16. Self-Checks (Run Before Reviewer Brief)

1. Has the taxpayer qualified under a single, identifiable test (BFR or PPT)? If both, the test that is most clearly met for the longest period is the elected test. Document the choice.
2. For PPT: does the 12-month window contain at least 330 full foreign-country days? Show the day-by-day or trip-by-trip log.
3. Has the tax home requirement been affirmatively confirmed (foreign residential lease, foreign bank account, foreign tax filings as a resident)?
4. Has the §911 election history been reviewed for the prior 5 years? Has the election been revoked? Is the current election a "new" election within the 5-year lockout?
5. Does the foreign earned income reconcile to W-2 / Schedule C / K-1 inputs?
6. Is any US-source income properly excluded from foreign earned income (allocated by workdays)?
7. Has the housing exclusion/deduction been correctly calculated using the base ($20,800 for full year) and the locality cap (general $39,000 or the high-cost-locality figure from the successor to Notice 2024-44)?
8. Has the §911(f) stacked tax worksheet been computed and the bottom-line tax verified against the IRS Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet?
9. For self-employed taxpayers: has SE tax been computed on the FULL Schedule C net profit (no FEIE reduction)?
10. For totalization-agreement countries: has the Certificate of Coverage been collected (or is its absence explicitly flagged)?
11. Has the §911 vs FTC comparison been modeled? Is the chosen approach documented with rationale?
12. Has the §6072(c) extension been claimed (statement attached to return) if the taxpayer was abroad on April 15?
13. Has the IRA/Roth IRA contribution eligibility been re-checked after §911 reduces compensation?
14. Has QBI been correctly computed (excluding the §911-excluded portion from QBI base)?
15. Has the AMT computation correctly used the stacked-tax approach?
16. For green card holders: has the §911 availability been verified (green card holders are eligible only for the PPT, not the BFR)?
17. Has the housing-cost worksheet been built (line-item rent + utilities + insurance + parking) excluding domestic help, telephone, internet, depreciation?
18. Has the foreign-currency translation been performed at the appropriate yearly average exchange rate (IRS publishes annual rates) for income items, or at the spot rate for housing payments?
19. Has the spouse coordination been addressed (only one spouse may claim housing exclusion for the shared household)?
20. Has the reviewer been given the day-count log, housing worksheet, FEIE vs FTC comparison, and the §911(f) worksheet as attachments?
