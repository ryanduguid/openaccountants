# US 50-State Estimated Tax Safe-Harbor Matrix (Tax Year 2025)

## 1. Scope

This skill is a **reference matrix** for state-level estimated tax obligations layered on top of the federal Form 1040-ES (individual) and Form 1120-W (corporate) regime. It addresses:

- **Quarterly due dates** for each state's individual and corporate estimated tax payments
- **Safe-harbor percentages** that shield taxpayers from underpayment penalties under each state's tax-administration statute
- **Installment schedules** (most states mirror the federal 25/25/25/25 equal-quarter rule; **California** uses **30/40/0/30** under R&TC §19136; **New York** applies a **Mandatory First Installment (MFI)** of 25 % or 40 % for corporations)
- **Underpayment penalty rates** (state-set, sometimes pegged to federal short-term AFR + 3, sometimes statutory flat)
- **Annualized income installment method** availability (the federal §6654(d)(2) equivalent at the state level)
- **Pass-through entity (PTE) election** estimated-payment regimes, which run on their own calendar and are **separate** from the owner's individual estimates and from regular corporate estimates

**Out of scope.** Property tax estimates, sales/use tax prepayments, state employer withholding deposits, state unemployment (SUTA) deposits, local/city estimated tax (NYC UBT, Philadelphia BIRT/NPT, San Francisco Gross Receipts) — these have separate skills.

**Audience.** Federal-and-state preparers, CPAs and Enrolled Agents working multistate returns, and reviewers checking whether a 2025 estimated-tax plan covers both the federal safe harbor under §6654 / §6655 **and** the parallel state safe harbor. A Circular 230 reviewer must sign off before any output reaches the taxpayer or any state revenue agency.

## 2. Federal Baseline (the starting point every state references)

### 2.1 Individual — Form 1040-ES, IRC §6654

- **Due dates:** April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 (of the following year)
- **Installment shares:** **25 % / 25 % / 25 % / 25 %** of required annual payment
- **Safe harbor (the "no underpayment penalty" test):** pay the lesser of —
  - 90 % of current-year tax, **or**
  - 100 % of prior-year tax (**110 %** if prior-year AGI > $150,000; $75,000 if MFJ filing separately)
- **Annualized income installment method:** §6654(d)(2). Allows variable quarterly payments matched to year-to-date income; reported on Form 2210 Schedule AI.
- **Underpayment penalty rate (2025):** **federal short-term AFR + 3 percentage points**, compounded daily. Rate is reset quarterly by the IRS in Revenue Rulings. Q4 2025 rate: **7 %**.

### 2.2 Corporate — Form 1120-W, IRC §6655

- **Due dates (calendar-year C corp):** April 15, June 15, September 15, December 15
- **Installment shares:** 25 / 25 / 25 / 25
- **Safe harbor:**
  - 100 % of current-year tax, **or**
  - 100 % of prior-year tax (only if prior year was a full 12 months **and** showed a positive tax liability)
  - **Large corporations** (taxable income ≥ $1 million in any of the 3 preceding years) — current-year only, except the first installment may use the prior-year safe harbor with the shortfall caught up in Q2
- **Annualized income:** §6655(e). Available; corporate version of the AI method.
- **Penalty:** §6655 underpayment penalty at AFR + 3 (same calculation methodology as §6654 for individuals, applied to corporations).

### 2.3 Why state rules diverge from federal

States are not required to conform to §6654 / §6655. Five recurring deviations:

1. **Different installment shares.** California (30/40/0/30 individual), New York (MFI for corp), a handful of others use unequal weights to front-load revenue.
2. **Different safe-harbor percentages.** Some states require 90 % current-year only (no prior-year safe harbor). Others bump the high-AGI prior-year threshold (e.g., California uses 110 % at AGI > $150,000 mirroring federal, but applies it at California AGI).
3. **Different due dates.** Most align with federal, but a few (e.g., Iowa, Hawaii) shift the final installment.
4. **Different penalty rates.** Statutory flat rates (Massachusetts at federal rate + 4), or pegged to a different reference (Pennsylvania pegs to AFR + 3 but rounds differently).
5. **PTE election overlay.** 36 states + NYC + DC now have a Pass-Through Entity Tax election. Each has its own estimated-payment schedule for the **entity**, separate from the owner's individual estimates.

## 3. California 30/40/0/30 Deep Dive (R&TC §19136)

### 3.1 The statutory rule

California Revenue and Taxation Code §19136(a)(1) imposes an underpayment penalty if the taxpayer fails to pay the required installment by the installment due date. **R&TC §19136.1** specifies the installment percentages for individuals:

| Installment | Due date | % of required annual payment |
|---|---|---|
| **1st** | April 15 | **30 %** |
| **2nd** | June 15 | **40 %** |
| **3rd** | September 15 | **0 %** |
| **4th** | January 15 (following year) | **30 %** |

The September installment is **zero**. This is the single most-missed quirk in CA estimated tax planning. Taxpayers who use the federal 25/25/25/25 default end the Q1+Q2 cycle having paid 50 % to California when they should have paid **70 %** — and California issues an underpayment penalty on the Q1 + Q2 shortfall computed from those original due dates.

### 3.2 The 110 % high-AGI rule (CA mirrors federal)

R&TC §19136(c)(2) requires **110 %** of prior-year tax (not 100 %) if California AGI exceeded **$150,000** (or $75,000 MFS) in the prior year. California AGI is a different number from federal AGI — Schedule CA (540) adjustments matter.

### 3.3 The $1 million income exception (CA-unique)

R&TC §19136(c)(3): if California AGI exceeded **$1,000,000** in the prior year (any filing status except MFS, where it's $500,000), the prior-year safe harbor is **unavailable**. The taxpayer must use the 90 % current-year safe harbor — meaning the only way to avoid penalty is to estimate 2025 California tax accurately, in real time.

### 3.4 Penalty mechanics — Form 5805

California uses **Form 5805 Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals and Fiduciaries**. The penalty rate for 2025 is set by the FTB quarterly and is generally aligned with the federal §6621 rate but published separately. Q4 2025 rate is **7 %**.

### 3.5 Corporate side (R&TC §19142 et seq.)

California corporations follow the federal 25/25/25/25 schedule — the 30/40/0/30 rule is **individuals only**. But California has its own twist for **first-year corporations**: a new corporation's first taxable year minimum franchise tax ($800) is **waived** under R&TC §17941 for LLCs (legislatively extended through 2023, expired for entities formed 2024 onward unless re-extended — verify current legislative status before applying).

### 3.6 AUDIT FLASH POINT — California 30/40/0/30 missed installments

**The single most common multistate CPA error.** Symptoms:

- Federal estimates paid 25/25/25/25, totaling 100 % of safe harbor by January 15 — clean federally.
- California estimates **also** paid 25/25/25/25, totaling 100 % of safe harbor by January 15.
- FTB issues a Form 5805 underpayment penalty notice for **Q1 + Q2 shortfall** (paid 50 %, should have paid 70 %), computed at the daily rate from April 15 to the date paid.

**Remediation in a 2025 plan.** Build the California schedule on a 30/40/0/30 basis from the start. Do **not** copy the federal vouchers into the CA vouchers. The FTB's Form 540-ES voucher pre-prints the percentages on the back of the form.

---

## 4. New York Mandatory First Installment (MFI) for Corporations

### 4.1 The rule (Tax Law §213-b for Article 9-A corporations; §1085 for Article 33)

Corporations subject to the New York State franchise tax (Article 9-A) must pay a **Mandatory First Installment** by the 15th day of the 3rd month following the close of the prior taxable year — **March 15** for calendar-year filers. The MFI is calculated as a percentage of the **second preceding year's tax** (i.e., for the 2025 MFI, you look at the 2023 return):

- **25 %** if the second preceding year's franchise tax was **≤ $100,000**
- **40 %** if the second preceding year's franchise tax was **> $100,000**

This is **separate** from the federal Form 1120-W schedule. The remaining 75 % (or 60 %) is paid on the standard June 15, September 15, December 15 installments via Form CT-400.

### 4.2 The $100,000 cliff

There is no graduated zone. A corporation with prior-year tax of $99,999 pays an MFI of $24,999.75. A corporation with prior-year tax of $100,001 pays an MFI of **$40,000.40** — a $15,400 jump for $2 of additional prior tax. Tax-planning corollary: a corporation that anticipates crossing the threshold should not artificially compress year-end deductions to land at $99,999, because the **second preceding** year governs (not last year), creating a two-year lag.

### 4.3 NYC parallel rules

New York City General Corporation Tax and Business Corporation Tax have **parallel** MFI rules under NYC Admin. Code §11-658 — same 25 % / 40 % at the same $100,000 threshold, but applied to the NYC tax (not the NYS tax). A corporation operating in NYC pays **two** MFIs on March 15: one to NYS, one to NYC.

### 4.4 AUDIT FLASH POINT — NY MFI underpayment at the $100k cliff

If a corporation's second-preceding-year tax was right at $100,000 and the corporation paid 25 % (assuming the lower threshold), but the actual second-preceding-year tax on a later audit-adjusted return was $100,250, the corporation underpaid the MFI by 15 % of the second-preceding-year tax. The penalty under Tax Law §1085(c) is computed at the underpayment rate set quarterly by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance — Q4 2025 rate **7.5 %** — from March 15 to the date paid.

---

## 5. Annualized Income Installment Method (Federal §6654(d)(2) and state variants)

### 5.1 Federal mechanics

Form 2210 Schedule AI lets a taxpayer with **uneven income** (seasonal business, large one-time capital gain, year-end bonus) compute each installment based on actual year-to-date income through the installment due date, annualized:

- Q1: YTD through March 31 × 4 = annualized; multiply by tax rate; multiply by 22.5 %
- Q2: YTD through May 31 × (12/5) = annualized; multiply by tax rate; multiply by 45 %
- Q3: YTD through August 31 × (12/8) = annualized; multiply by tax rate; multiply by 67.5 %
- Q4: YTD through December 31 = actual; multiply by tax rate; multiply by 90 %

The cumulative required installment is the lesser of (a) the annualized amount, or (b) the standard 25/25/25/25 cumulative amount. Lower installments early, larger ones late — useful for any taxpayer who realizes most income in Q4.

### 5.2 State availability

Most states with PIT explicitly adopt the annualized income method (by conformity or by parallel statute). California uses **Form 5805 Schedule AI**, but the **periods are different** because the 30/40/0/30 installment schedule means the cumulative-percentage targets are 22.5 % / 67.5 % (skip Q3) / 90 %. The Q3 zero-installment makes the CA schedule AI substantially different from federal — preparers must not copy federal numbers.

States that **do not** publish an explicit annualized income method but conform-by-reference to federal (e.g., Massachusetts, via G.L. c.62C §32A) require attaching the federal Schedule AI to the state penalty form. Texas, Florida, and the other no-PIT states have no individual annualized method (no individual estimated tax at all).

## 6. PTE Election Estimated Payments

The pass-through entity tax (PTE) elective regime is now in **36 states + NYC + DC** as of tax year 2025 (the AICPA state-PTE tracker is the authoritative source). Each PTE election creates an **entity-level** tax liability that is **separate** from the owner's individual estimated tax. The owner's individual estimates do **not** count toward the PTE — and the PTE estimates do **not** count toward the owner's individual estimates. They are two parallel obligations.

### 6.1 Common features

- The PTE files quarterly estimates (typically on the same federal calendar of 4/15, 6/15, 9/15, 12/15 or 1/15)
- The PTE issues a credit certificate (K-1 footnote or state-specific form) to each owner
- The owner claims the PTE credit on their individual state return — but the individual still has to pay state estimated tax on **non-PTE income** through normal channels
- **California's PTE (R&TC §19900)** is the most-cited trap: requires a **June 15 payment of the greater of 50 % of last year's PTE tax or $1,000** to validly elect for the year. Miss the June 15 payment by even a day and **the election is invalid** for that year — there is no late-payment cure. The PTE then files as a normal entity (no entity-level tax, no owner credit), generally a worse outcome than not electing at all.

### 6.2 PTE-only quarterly schedule examples (illustrative)

| State | PTE estimate due dates | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CA | June 15 (prepay), March 15 (final) | June 15 prepay is gate to validity |
| NY | March 15, June 15, September 15, December 15 | 4 equal installments; election due March 15 |
| NJ | April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 | Mirrors federal individual schedule |
| MA | April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15 | Mirrors federal individual |
| IL | April 15, June 15, September 15, December 15 | Mirrors federal corporate |

### 7.3 Key clusters and traps

**Corp Q1 due March 15 (not April 15):** CT, MA, MN, NY, PA, WI. Six states require the first corporate installment one month earlier than federal. Calendar-block these separately.

**Individual Q1 due other than April 15:** DE (4/30), HI (4/20), IA (4/30), VA (5/1). Four states. Most preparers default the Q1 voucher to April 15 and miss these.

**Final installment due other than January 15:** HI (1/20), IA (1/31). Both unusual.

**No prior-year safe harbor at the corporate level:** GA (70 %), KY (70 %), OK (70 %), CO (70 %), MS (80 %), MT (80 %), NJ (80 %), RI (80 %). Current-year accuracy required.

**Highest statutory penalty rates:** RI 18 %, ND 12 %, WI 12 %, FL 12 %, AK 11 %. Underpayment is expensive.

**No quarterly estimates at all:** TX (annual franchise tax only), WY, SD, NV (general corp/personal income).

## 8. Worked Examples

### 8.1 California freelancer with seasonal income

**Facts.** Sole proprietor in Los Angeles, CA. 2024 California tax liability $42,000 on California AGI of $260,000 (above the $150k threshold). 2025 projected income lumpy: $30k Q1, $50k Q2, $20k Q3, $200k Q4 (year-end consulting project). Projected 2025 CA tax ≈ $48,000.

**Federal safe harbor (for reference).** 110 % × prior-year federal tax. Pay 4 × 25 % = 25 % of safe harbor each quarter.

**California safe harbor.** Because 2024 California AGI > $150,000, the prior-year safe harbor is **110 % × $42,000 = $46,200**. Lower of $46,200 (110 % prior) or 90 % × $48,000 = $43,200 (90 % current) — required annual payment = **$43,200**.

**Default (wrong) approach — 25/25/25/25.**

| Q | Due | Required cumulative under federal 25/25/25/25 | Required cumulative under CA 30/40/0/30 | Shortfall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | 4/15 | $10,800 (25 %) | **$12,960 (30 %)** | $2,160 |
| Q2 | 6/15 | $21,600 (50 %) | **$30,240 (70 %)** | $8,640 |
| Q3 | 9/15 | $32,400 (75 %) | $30,240 (70 %) | overpaid (not penalized) |
| Q4 | 1/15 | $43,200 (100 %) | $43,200 (100 %) | $0 |

The 25/25/25/25 approach generates a Q1 + Q2 cumulative shortfall of **$8,640** from June 15 through whenever it's caught up. At the FTB's 7 % rate, the penalty for a 3-month delay (caught up at Q3) is approximately **$151** — small, but the FTB sends a notice that takes professional time to respond to.

**Annualized income method alternative.** The Q3 zero-installment in CA's schedule already accommodates seasonal income better than federal. But CA's Form 5805 Schedule AI lets the freelancer annualize: Q1 cumulative income $30k → annualized $120k → CA tax ≈ $7,800 → 22.5 % × $7,800 = **$1,755 Q1**. Substantially lower than $12,960. This works **only if** the freelancer commits to the AIM for **all four installments** — can't switch between regular and AIM mid-year. The Q4 catch-up after the big project will be large but penalty-free.

**Recommendation.** Use CA AIM Schedule. Pay $1,755 by 4/15, recalculate at each due date.

### 8.2 New York corporation crossing the MFI threshold

**Facts.** Calendar-year C corp. Article 9-A franchise tax for tax year 2023 was $98,000. Tax year 2024 was $145,000. Tax year 2025 projected at $160,000.

**2025 MFI calculation.** Use **second preceding year** = 2023. 2023 tax was $98,000, which is **≤ $100,000**. MFI = **25 % × $98,000 = $24,500**, due **March 15, 2025**.

**Remaining 2025 installments.** Required total = $160,000 (current-year). Required remaining after MFI = $160,000 − $24,500 = $135,500, paid as $45,167 per installment on 6/15, 9/15, 12/15.

**The trap.** A preparer who looks only at 2024 tax ($145,000, above $100k) and computes MFI as 40 % × $145,000 = $58,000 **overpays**, locking up $33,500 in unnecessary state estimated payments. Conversely, a preparer who uses the **current-year projection** ($160,000) and 40 % gets $64,000 — even more wrong.

**Year-after-next trap.** For tax year 2026, the second-preceding year is **2024 = $145,000** — now over $100k. So 2026 MFI = 40 % × $145,000 = **$58,000**, due 3/15/2026. The corporation should plan March cash flow accordingly. The two-year lag means a one-year revenue spike pushes the MFI rate up two years later.

### 8.3 Multistate partnership making PTE election in CA, NY, and NJ

**Facts.** Three-partner consulting LLP. Calendar-year 2025. Allocated income: 50 % CA-source, 30 % NY-source, 20 % NJ-source. Partners are individuals resident in California. Each state allows PTE election. Total projected partnership net income $1,200,000.

**Apportioned PTE liabilities (illustrative — actual tax rates apply).**

| State | Apportioned income | Approximate PTE rate (2025) | PTE tax | Critical estimate dates |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CA | $600,000 | 9.3 % | $55,800 | **6/15/25 prepay** $27,900 (50 %) → election gate; balance 3/15/26 |
| NY | $360,000 | 6.85 % (graduated) | ≈ $25,800 | 3/15, 6/15, 9/15, 12/15 → 4 equal of $6,450 |
| NJ | $240,000 | 5.675 % (sliding) | ≈ $13,600 | 4/15, 6/15, 9/15, 1/16 → 4 equal of $3,400 |

**Critical dependencies.**

- **The June 15, 2025 California PTE prepayment of $27,900 is the gate to the entire CA election.** Miss by one day and the LLP cannot make the CA PTE election for 2025. The partners then lose the federal-deduction SALT-cap workaround for $55,800 of CA tax. Federal cost ≈ 37 % × $55,800 = **$20,646** in lost federal deduction value.
- **The NY 3/15/2025 first installment of $6,450 must be paid by the partnership separately** from any individual estimate. The individual partners' CA Form 540-ES vouchers do not satisfy the NY entity-level estimate.
- **Individual partners** still owe California Form 540-ES estimates on **non-PTE income** (e.g., spouse W-2, investment income). The PTE credit on the 2025 California return offsets the PTE-source tax only; everything else needs to be on the 30/40/0/30 individual schedule.

**Calendar action items.**

| Date | Action |
|---|---|
| 3/15/25 | NY PTE Q1 ($6,450); NY corp MFI if any (separate entity) |
| 4/15/25 | NJ PTE Q1 ($3,400); individual federal & CA Q1 |
| **6/15/25** | **CA PTE prepayment ($27,900)** — gates election; individual federal & CA Q2 |
| 6/15/25 | NY PTE Q2; NJ PTE Q2 |
| 9/15/25 | NY PTE Q3; NJ PTE Q3; individual federal Q3 (CA individual Q3 = $0 — do not pay) |
| 12/15/25 | NY PTE Q4 |
| 1/15/26 | Individual federal Q4 & CA Q4; NJ PTE Q4 |
| 3/15/26 | CA PTE final ($27,900); NY entity tax return; partnership return federally |

## 9. Audit Flash Points (consolidated)

1. **CA 30/40/0/30 missed installments.** Preparer defaults to 25/25/25/25 for CA, generating a Q1 + Q2 cumulative shortfall and an FTB Form 5805 penalty notice. **Always build CA on the unique installment schedule from scratch.**
2. **NY MFI underpayment at the $100k cliff.** Corporation with second-preceding-year tax of $98,000–$102,000 — the 25 %/40 % distinction creates large nominal swings on the March 15 payment. Verify the second-preceding-year tax from the **filed return as adjusted**, not the original return.
3. **Multistate freelancers using federal safe harbor without state coverage.** Paying 110 % of prior federal tax is irrelevant to most state safe harbors. Each state safe harbor is computed on **that state's prior-year tax** (allocated to that state). A California-resident consultant who moves Q3 to New York for the year owes individual estimates to **both** states for the year of the move.
4. **CA $1 million income exception.** If prior-year CA AGI > $1,000,000, **the prior-year safe harbor is unavailable**. Must use 90 % current-year. Common error: rolling forward 110 % prior calculation without checking the $1M threshold.
5. **CA PTE June 15 prepayment.** Missing by even one day **invalidates the election for the entire year**. No late-payment cure. Set a calendar alert at 5/15 and 6/1.
6. **Iowa late final installment (1/31).** Iowa individual Q4 is January 31, not January 15. Federally-aligned preparers underpay Iowa Q4 from 1/15 to 1/31 with zero consequence (Iowa expects nothing until 1/31), but more importantly, an Iowa taxpayer who pays the federal Q4 on 1/15 to IA expecting to satisfy both gets it backwards — federal isn't satisfied, Iowa is.
7. **Corporate Q1 March 15 states.** CT, MA, MN, NY, PA, WI. Missing the March 15 payment and paying on April 15 with federal generates one month of underpayment penalty.
8. **PTE-vs-individual double-payment risk.** Partners sometimes pay individual estimates AND PTE estimates assuming one will absorb the other. They don't — the partners then claim a PTE credit on the return and end up with a large refund. Not penalized, but cash-flow distortive.
9. **Texas franchise tax annual-only.** No Texas quarterly estimates exist. Preparers from quarterly-states may inadvertently set up phantom quarterly vouchers.
10. **NH I&D Tax repealed 2025.** Estimated payments for the New Hampshire Interest & Dividends Tax should have ceased after the 2024 final installment. Continued payments will be refunded but generate an FTB notice.
