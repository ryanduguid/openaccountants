# IRC §1202 — Qualified Small Business Stock Gain Exclusion (Tax Year 2025)

> **Circular 230 disclosure.** This skill produces draft workpapers and analytical positions for review by a credentialed practitioner (Enrolled Agent, CPA, or attorney admitted to practice before the IRS). Nothing produced here is a written opinion within the meaning of Circular 230 §10.37, is not marketed tax advice, and may not be used by the taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding tax penalties unless a reviewer signs off on the position in a separate written communication that satisfies §10.37(a)(2). The §1202 position has been litigated repeatedly (see Section 14, Provenance) and the SSTB determination under §1202(e)(3) is fact-intensive — every conclusion in this skill is provisional pending reviewer confirmation against the actual corporate records, gross-asset history, and trade-or-business facts of the issuer.

## 1. Scope and Refusal Catalogue

### 1.1 In scope

This skill computes and documents the §1202 gain exclusion for a US individual taxpayer (or a passthrough holder where §1202(g) flow-through applies) who sells stock in a domestic C-corporation that qualified as Qualified Small Business Stock at the time of issuance and at all relevant times during the holding period. It covers:

- The four §1202 acquisition windows (pre-2/18/2009, 2/18/2009–9/27/2010, post-9/27/2010 pre-OBBBA, post-OBBBA enactment).
- The OBBBA P.L. 119-21 (July 4, 2025) tiered exclusion at 3, 4, and 5 years of holding, the $75M gross-asset cap (up from $50M), and the $15M per-issuer cap (up from $10M).
- The §1202(c) "qualified small business stock" definition, the §1202(d) "qualified small business" definition, the §1202(e) active business requirement, and the §1202(e)(3) SSTB exclusion list.
- The §1045 rollover election (60-day reinvestment) for taxpayers who sell before satisfying the holding period.
- The §1202(g) flow-through rules for partnership-held QSBS.
- AMT treatment under §57(a)(7) for §1202 gain.
- Form 8949 Code "Q" reporting and Schedule D carryover.
- State conformity in the major founder-resident states (CA, NY, NJ, MA, WA, TX, FL).
- Family/trust stacking strategies and the §1202(h) tacking rules for gifts and bequests.
- SAFE, convertible-note, and option exercise mechanics that determine the QSBS clock start date.

### 1.2 Out of scope — refusal catalogue

This skill MUST refuse and escalate to a credentialed practitioner where:

1. The corporation has ever been an S-corp, partnership, LLC taxed as a partnership, or disregarded entity during any part of the taxpayer's holding period. §1202(c)(1) requires C-corp status at issuance AND substantially all of the holding period. The conversion-tacking question is a fact-and-circumstances mess — escalate.
2. The corporation underwent a tax-free reorganization (§354, §355, §368) and the taxpayer received non-QSBS stock or boot. §1202(h)(4) preserves QSBS character for §368(a) reorganizations only in limited circumstances — escalate.
3. The corporation is a Regulated Investment Company (RIC), Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduit (REMIC), Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC), or cooperative — §1202(e)(4) categorically excludes these.
4. The corporation is engaged in farming, mineral extraction (§613), hotel/motel/restaurant operation, banking, insurance, financing, or leasing as more than 20% of asset value — §1202(e)(3) and §1202(e)(7).
5. The taxpayer is a C-corporation. §1202(a) applies only to "taxpayer other than a corporation."
6. The stock was acquired by exercise of an option that itself was acquired more than 6 months before the underlying corporation was a C-corp; the issuance-date analysis is too fact-specific for an automated skill.
7. The taxpayer is claiming §1202 on stock acquired through a §351 incorporation where the contributed property's built-in gain exceeds $50,000 — the §1202(i) basis-step-up rules and the carryover holding period need manual analysis.
8. The corporation made a "significant redemption" under §1202(c)(3) (more than 5% of stock by value from related parties within 2 years before or after the issuance) — this destroys QSBS for all holders and requires factual investigation.
9. The taxpayer holds the stock through a trust that is not a grantor trust — the §1202(g) flow-through analysis for non-grantor trusts is unsettled.
10. The taxpayer is a non-resident alien or a foreign trust/estate.
11. State conformity questions outside CA, NY, NJ, MA, WA, TX, FL — escalate to a state specialist.

### 1.3 Conservative defaults principle

When in doubt:

- **Default to "not QSBS"** unless the taxpayer provides documentary proof of all four §1202(c) requirements.
- **Default to the pre-OBBBA caps** ($10M / 10× basis / 5-year hold) if the issuance date or sale date is ambiguous around the OBBBA effective date — the OBBBA rules apply prospectively to stock acquired after the date of enactment (July 4, 2025) under the statutory text; pre-existing stock continues under the old caps unless a later guidance package extends the new caps retroactively (none has been issued as of 2025-11-15).
- **Default to "fully taxable"** for state purposes in CA, NJ, MS, and PA (the four major non-conforming states) until the reviewer confirms state treatment.

## 2. Statutory Anatomy: §1202 in Twelve Pieces

§1202 is one of the most litigated and most planning-intensive provisions in the Code. Its operative pieces:

| Subsection | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| §1202(a) | Operative exclusion percentage (50%, 75%, or 100% pre-OBBBA; tiered 50/75/100% post-OBBBA based on holding period). |
| §1202(b) | Per-issuer dollar cap: greater of $10M lifetime ($15M post-OBBBA) or 10× aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year. |
| §1202(c) | Definition of QSBS: original-issuance requirement, C-corp requirement at issuance and during substantially all of the holding period, active business requirement. |
| §1202(c)(3) | Anti-abuse: significant redemptions destroy QSBS. |
| §1202(d) | Definition of "qualified small business": $50M gross-asset cap pre-OBBBA, $75M post-OBBBA, measured at any time from corporate formation through and immediately after issuance. |
| §1202(e) | Active business requirement: at least 80% of corporate assets used in qualified trade or business during substantially all of the holding period. |
| §1202(e)(3) | Excluded SSTB list — see Section 5. |
| §1202(e)(4) | Excluded entity types (RIC, REIT, REMIC, DISC, cooperative). |
| §1202(f) | Treatment of stock acquired by conversion of other stock — preserves §1202 character. |
| §1202(g) | Pass-thru entities: partnerships, S-corporations, RICs, and common trust funds may pass §1202 gain to partners, shareholders, and beneficiaries who held the entity interest at the time the QSBS was acquired by the entity and continuously thereafter. |
| §1202(h) | Tacking: gift, death, and certain partnership distributions preserve §1202 character and tack holding period. |
| §1202(i) | Basis rules for stock received in §351 incorporations and contributions of appreciated property. |
| §1202(j) | Stock acquired on conversion of convertible debt — clock starts at conversion. |
| §1202(k) | Regulatory authority. |
| §1202(l) | Stock in pass-through holding companies — limited application. |

---

## 3. Pre-OBBBA §1202 (Stock Acquired Before July 4, 2025)

For stock acquired prior to OBBBA enactment, three exclusion percentages apply based on acquisition window. **These rules continue to apply to all QSBS issued before July 4, 2025**, regardless of when the stock is sold.

### 3.1 Acquisition windows

| Acquisition window | §1202(a) exclusion | §57(a)(7) AMT add-back |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-2/18/2009 | 50% | 7% of excluded gain |
| 2/18/2009–9/27/2010 | 75% | 7% of excluded gain |
| Post-9/27/2010 to 7/3/2025 | 100% | None (zero AMT preference) |

Source: §1202(a)(3) (50% baseline), §1202(a)(3)(A) and §1202(a)(4) (75% and 100% as enacted by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 respectively; made permanent by the PATH Act of 2015).

### 3.2 Holding period

Pre-OBBBA, the holding period requirement was binary: **5 years or no §1202 benefit**. If the taxpayer sold before 5 years, the only escape was a §1045 rollover (Section 6) or treating the gain as ordinary capital gain.

### 3.3 Per-issuer cap

§1202(b)(1) caps the exclusion at the greater of:

- $10 million per issuer per taxpayer (lifetime, reduced by §1202 gain from the same issuer in prior years), or
- 10 × aggregate adjusted basis of QSBS from that issuer disposed of by the taxpayer during the taxable year.

This is a **per-issuer, per-taxpayer** cap. A taxpayer can claim up to $10M (now $15M, see Section 4) of excluded gain from each separate qualifying corporation. Married couples filing jointly share a single cap per issuer (§1202(b)(3)(B)) — but separate spouses with separately-acquired QSBS each get their own cap.

### 3.4 Gross-asset cap

Pre-OBBBA, the corporation's aggregate gross assets could not exceed $50M at any time from August 10, 1993, through and immediately after the issuance of the stock (§1202(d)(1)). Importantly:

- The test is on **gross assets** at adjusted basis, not fair market value (with a special rule for contributed property valued at FMV at contribution).
- The test applies at every moment in the corporation's history up to and through the issuance — but **not after issuance**. A company can blow past $50M in gross assets the day after issuance and the originally-issued QSBS remains QSBS.
- All corporations in the same parent-subsidiary controlled group under §1202(d)(3) are aggregated.

## 4. OBBBA 2025 Expansion (Stock Acquired On or After July 4, 2025)

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L. 119-21), enacted July 4, 2025, dramatically expanded §1202 for stock acquired on or after the date of enactment. The expansion has four moving parts:

### 4.1 Tiered exclusion by holding period — NEW

OBBBA §70423(a) introduces a tiered exclusion that rewards shorter holds. For QSBS acquired on or after July 4, 2025:

| Holding period | §1202(a) exclusion | Taxable LTCG portion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Less than 3 years | 0% (no §1202 benefit; §1045 rollover only) | 100% |
| 3 years to less than 4 years | 50% | 50% |
| 4 years to less than 5 years | 75% | 25% |
| 5 years or more | 100% | 0% (subject to per-issuer cap) |

The pre-OBBBA "5-year cliff" is replaced by a graduated ramp. A founder who exits at year 3 still captures meaningful §1202 benefit; pre-OBBBA, that founder would have had to choose between §1045 rollover or full LTCG treatment.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — holding-period documentation.** For the 3-year and 4-year tiers, the IRS will scrutinize the exact acquisition date. SAFEs that convert (Section 11.3), option exercises (Section 11.4), and §351 incorporations (Section 11.5) all introduce holding-period ambiguity. Maintain a contemporaneous record: original stock certificate or electronic ledger entry, board resolutions authorizing issuance, cap table entries with effective dates, and (for conversions) the conversion documentation showing the exact date QSBS clock started.

### 4.2 Per-issuer cap raised to $15M — NEW

OBBBA §70423(b) raises the §1202(b)(1) per-issuer cap from $10M to **$15M** (with conforming amendment to retain the 10× basis alternative). The cap is indexed for inflation beginning in 2027 (OBBBA §70423(b)(2)) — the first inflation adjustment will appear in the 2027 Rev. Proc. annual update.

### 4.3 Gross-asset cap raised to $75M — NEW

OBBBA §70423(c) raises the §1202(d)(1) gross-asset cap from $50M to **$75M**, also indexed for inflation beginning in 2027. This expands the universe of "qualified small business" issuers — a Series B or even Series C company that would have blown the $50M cap can now issue QSBS up to the $75M threshold.

### 4.4 Effective date

OBBBA §70423(d): the amendments apply to stock **acquired on or after the date of enactment** (July 4, 2025). Stock issued before that date continues under the pre-OBBBA caps and pre-OBBBA holding period requirement.

**Practical consequence — the "dual track" period.** From July 4, 2025 forward, taxpayers and reviewers must track QSBS by issuance date:

- Pre-July-4-2025 QSBS: $10M / 10× basis cap, 5-year cliff, $50M gross-asset cap.
- Post-July-4-2025 QSBS: $15M / 10× basis cap, 3/4/5-year tier, $75M gross-asset cap.

These two pools are tested separately under §1202(b)(1), but the per-issuer cap is "per issuer" not "per pool" — if a taxpayer holds both pre-OBBBA and post-OBBBA QSBS from the **same issuer**, the higher $15M cap applies to the aggregate (the OBBBA statute is silent on this and Treasury has not issued guidance; this skill defaults to the conservative position that the lower pre-OBBBA cap applies to pre-OBBBA stock and the higher post-OBBBA cap applies to post-OBBBA stock, treated as separate "tranches" within the same issuer — escalate to reviewer).

### 4.5 OBBBA expansion summary table

| Element | Pre-OBBBA (issuance < 7/4/2025) | Post-OBBBA (issuance ≥ 7/4/2025) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| §1202(a) exclusion | 100% at 5 years (post-9/27/2010 stock) | 50% at 3 years, 75% at 4 years, 100% at 5 years |
| §1202(b)(1) per-issuer cap | $10M / 10× basis | $15M / 10× basis (inflation-indexed 2027+) |
| §1202(d)(1) gross-asset cap | $50M | $75M (inflation-indexed 2027+) |
| §57(a)(7) AMT preference | Zero for 100% stock | Zero for 100% stock; tiered for 50%/75% stock (see Section 7) |
| §1045 rollover | Available | Available (and now less critical because of the 3-year tier) |

---

## 5. The §1202(c) Qualification Requirements

For stock to be QSBS, **every one of the following five requirements** must be satisfied. Failure of any one destroys QSBS character.

### 5.1 C-corporation status

The issuer must be a domestic C-corporation at the time of issuance and during **substantially all** of the taxpayer's holding period (§1202(c)(1) and §1202(c)(2)). "Substantially all" is not defined in the statute but is generally interpreted (per IRS Field Service Advice 200145011 and consistent practitioner practice) as more than 90% of the holding period.

**Hard rules:**
- **S-corp at any time during holding period → QSBS destroyed.** §1202(c)(2)(A) makes this categorical. An S-corp election made after issuance terminates QSBS status from the date of the S-election.
- **LLC taxed as partnership at any time → QSBS destroyed.** The corporation must be a C-corp under Subchapter C, not a state-law LLC even if it has elected C-corp tax status from inception (the entity must be a "corporation" within the §7701 meaning AND have elected C-corp treatment from inception, with no intervening partnership period).
- **Conversion of LLC to C-corp**: the QSBS clock starts at the date of conversion (not the date of the original LLC formation). Pre-conversion LLC holding does NOT tack. See Section 11.5.
- **Conversion of C-corp to S-corp or LLC**: kills QSBS prospectively. If the corp has been C-corp for at least 90% of the holding period before conversion, the analysis is fact-intensive — escalate.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — corporate form history.** The IRS routinely requests the complete entity history from formation to sale: state filings, Form 8832 entity classification elections, Form 2553 S-elections (and revocations), Form 1120 vs Form 1120-S filings, and operating agreements. A single Form 1120-S filing during the holding period can destroy the entire §1202 position. Reviewer must verify the corp's full Schedule B from each year's return shows C-corp filing status.

### 5.2 Original issuance requirement

The taxpayer must acquire the stock **directly from the corporation** in exchange for money, property (other than stock), or services (§1202(c)(1)(B)). Stock acquired in the secondary market — from another shareholder, in a tender offer, or on an exchange — is NOT QSBS in the hands of the new holder.

Three exceptions that preserve QSBS character:
- **Gift (§1202(h)(1)(A))** — donee tacks donor's holding period.
- **Death (§1202(h)(1)(B))** — heir tacks decedent's holding period.
- **Partnership distribution to a partner who was a partner when the partnership acquired the QSBS (§1202(h)(2))** — see Section 8.4.

Conversions of stock for stock in the same corporation under §1202(f) also preserve QSBS character (common preferred-to-common conversion at IPO).

### 5.3 Gross-asset cap at and immediately before issuance

The issuer's aggregate gross assets must not have exceeded $50M (pre-OBBBA) / $75M (post-OBBBA) at any time from August 10, 1993, through and **immediately after** the issuance (§1202(d)(1)).

Three nuances:
- **Gross assets at basis, not FMV** (except contributed property valued at FMV at contribution under §1202(d)(2)(B)).
- **"Immediately after" issuance**: the cash or property received in the very issuance that produced the QSBS is included in the asset test. A company at $74M gross assets that raises $5M cannot issue QSBS in that round because the post-issuance balance is $79M.
- **Aggregation** under §1202(d)(3): all corporations in a parent-subsidiary §1563(a) controlled group are aggregated. The 50%-by-vote-or-value threshold under §1563 applies.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — gross-asset documentation.** The single most common §1202 disqualifier on audit is failure to prove the gross-asset test at the moment of issuance. Reviewers MUST obtain:
> - The corporation's balance sheet as of the day immediately before and immediately after each QSBS issuance event the taxpayer participated in.
> - The §351 contribution documentation if applicable, with FMV valuations of contributed property.
> - The aggregation analysis for any subsidiaries.
> - For series-A/B/C rounds, the pre-money and post-money cap tables and signed financing documents.
> If the corporation cannot produce this, default to "not QSBS" and report the gain as ordinary LTCG.

### 5.4 Active business requirement (§1202(e))

During **substantially all** of the holding period:

- At least **80% of the corporation's assets (by value)** must be used in the active conduct of one or more qualified trades or businesses (§1202(e)(1)(A)).
- "Active conduct" excludes passive investment activities. Cash and working capital held for reasonable working capital needs (and reasonably expected to be used within 2 years for R&D or business expansion) DOES count as "used in" the active business (§1202(e)(6)).
- **Real property test**: ownership or operation of real property is treated as a non-qualified business unless the real property is used in the corporation's qualified trade or business (§1202(e)(7)). More than 10% of total asset value in non-qualified real property fails the test.
- **Portfolio stock and securities test**: more than 10% of total asset value in stock or securities of other corporations (other than subsidiaries) fails the test (§1202(e)(5)(B)).

### 5.5 §1202(e)(3) excluded trades or businesses (the "SSTB" list)

The active business must NOT be a "qualified trade or business" within the §1202(e)(3) exclusion list. This list is similar to but **not identical** to the §199A SSTB list — practitioners should NOT assume §199A and §1202 SSTB analyses produce the same result.

**§1202(e)(3) excluded trades:**

1. Any trade or business involving the performance of services in the fields of:
   - Health
   - Law
   - Engineering
   - Architecture
   - Accounting
   - Actuarial science
   - Performing arts
   - Consulting
   - Athletics
   - Financial services
   - Brokerage services
2. Any business where the principal asset is the **reputation or skill of one or more employees**.
3. Any banking, insurance, financing, leasing, investing, or similar business.
4. Any farming business (including the business of raising or harvesting trees).
5. Any business involving the production or extraction of products of a character with respect to which a deduction is allowable under §613 or §613A (mining, oil and gas).
6. Any business of operating a hotel, motel, restaurant, or similar business.

**Tech, software, manufacturing, retail, distribution, transportation, telecommunications, and most product-based businesses are NOT on this list and ARE eligible** for §1202.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — the "consulting" challenge.** The IRS has repeatedly challenged §1202 positions where a technology company derives revenue from services that look like consulting or "reputation/skill of employees." The leading guidance is:
> - **PLR 201436001 (June 2014)** — health-tech company providing services to insurance companies was held NOT a "health" business because it did not provide medical care.
> - **PLR 201717010 (Jan 2017)** — pharmacy company providing services to nursing homes was NOT a "health" business.
> - **PLR 202144026 (July 2021)** — staffing agency providing IT consultants WAS a "consulting" business; QSBS denied.
> - **Recent practitioner litigation (2023-2024)** has focused on the line between "software product" and "software-enabled consulting service." Companies that ship software that customers operate themselves are clearly product businesses; companies that deploy engineers to implement, customize, or operate software on behalf of customers risk the "consulting" or "reputation/skill" exclusion.
>
> When a company has mixed revenue (product + professional services), the §1202(e)(3) test is applied at the **entity** level by reference to the trade or business as a whole. There is no clean revenue percentage threshold; practitioners typically apply a "principal activity" test. If professional services revenue exceeds 25-30% of total revenue, escalate.

### 5.6 §5M-capital-deployment safe harbor

§1202(e)(6) treats assets held by the corporation that are reasonably expected to be used in a qualified trade or business or in R&D within 2 years as meeting the active business test. This means freshly-raised cash from a financing round is "active business" assets for up to 2 years even if it's parked in money-market funds.

For very young companies (within 2 years of becoming an active business), there is a working-capital safe harbor that effectively waives the active business test during the startup period.

---

## 6. §1045 Rollover (60-Day Reinvestment)

§1045 allows a taxpayer who sells QSBS before satisfying the §1202 holding period to **roll over** the gain by purchasing replacement QSBS within 60 days. This is a critical exit strategy for founders who experience an early acquisition.

### 6.1 Mechanics

1. Taxpayer sells QSBS at a gain.
2. Within **60 days** of the sale, taxpayer purchases replacement QSBS in a different (or same) qualified small business.
3. Taxpayer elects §1045 on a timely-filed return (including extensions) for the year of sale — election is made on Form 8949 with code "R" and a statement attached per Rev. Proc. 98-48.
4. Gain is recognized only to the extent the sale proceeds exceed the cost of the replacement QSBS.
5. The replacement QSBS takes a **substituted basis** equal to its cost reduced by the deferred gain.

### 6.2 Holding period of replacement QSBS — the open question

Whether the original holding period **tacks** to the replacement QSBS for §1202 purposes is one of the most contested questions in §1202 practice.

**Position A (statutory text)**: §1045(b)(4) provides that the holding period for the replacement QSBS includes the holding period of the original QSBS for purposes of determining gain or loss but is explicitly **not tacked for purposes of §1202(c)(2)** (the C-corp-at-issuance test). The statute is silent on §1202(a) holding period.

**Position B (Rev. Proc. 98-48 and longstanding IRS administrative position)**: the §1202 5-year clock RESTARTS at the acquisition of replacement QSBS. This is the IRS position.

**Position C (some practitioner commentary, e.g., Polsky 2024)**: the statute can be read to tack the holding period for all §1202 purposes; some practitioners take the aggressive position on disclosure.

**This skill defaults to Position B** (IRS administrative position): the §1202 clock restarts. Reviewer may consider Position C with proper disclosure (Form 8275) only if the planning context warrants it.

### 6.3 §1045 with OBBBA tiered exclusion

Post-OBBBA, §1045 becomes less critical for the 3-year and 4-year tiers — a founder who sells at year 3 can claim 50% exclusion directly without rolling over. But §1045 remains valuable for:

- Sales before 3 years (no §1202 exclusion is available at all).
- Sales at year 4-5 where rolling into a new investment with a fresh 5-year clock might yield a better total exclusion than 75% at year 4.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — late §1045 elections.** §1045(a) requires the election on a timely-filed return. Late elections require §301.9100 relief, which is granted on a fact-specific basis and requires showing reasonable action and good faith. The IRS has denied §9100 relief for §1045 in multiple PLRs where the taxpayer waited too long. Mark all §1045 sales on the engagement calendar and confirm the election goes out with the original (or extended) return.

### 6.4 Mechanics of the substituted basis

Example: Sell QSBS for $5M with $500k basis → $4.5M gain. Within 60 days, buy replacement QSBS for $3M.
- Recognized gain: $5M proceeds − $3M reinvested = $2M recognized now.
- Deferred gain: $4.5M − $2M = $2.5M.
- Basis in replacement QSBS: $3M − $2.5M deferred gain = $500k.
- New §1202 clock starts at acquisition of replacement QSBS.

If the replacement QSBS is held for 5+ years and qualifies under §1202, the $2.5M deferred gain plus any further appreciation can be excluded under §1202 (subject to the per-issuer cap of the replacement issuer).

---

## 7. AMT Treatment

### 7.1 100% exclusion stock (acquired after 9/27/2010)

§57(a)(7) treats 7% of the excluded §1202 gain as an AMT preference item. **However**, for 100%-exclusion stock acquired after September 27, 2010, the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 §2011(b) suspended the §57(a)(7) preference. **AMT impact for 100% stock = zero.**

This was the most significant feature of the post-2010 §1202 regime: pre-2010 QSBS produced phantom AMT income; post-2010 QSBS produces no AMT at all.

### 7.2 50% and 75% exclusion stock

For 50%-exclusion stock (pre-2/18/2009) and 75%-exclusion stock (2/18/2009–9/27/2010), §57(a)(7) applies: 7% of the excluded gain is an AMT preference item. With the current AMT exemption levels (post-TCJA and confirmed by OBBBA), this rarely produces AMT for individual founders but should be modeled.

### 7.3 OBBBA tiered exclusion stock (post-7/4/2025)

The OBBBA statutory text leaves §57(a)(7) unchanged. For post-OBBBA QSBS:
- **100% exclusion (5+ year hold)**: AMT impact zero, consistent with the post-2010 rule.
- **75% exclusion (4-5 year hold)**: §57(a)(7) preference applies — 7% of excluded gain.
- **50% exclusion (3-4 year hold)**: §57(a)(7) preference applies — 7% of excluded gain.

> Treasury has not issued guidance on whether the OBBBA tiered exclusion stock at the 50% and 75% tiers should be treated the same as pre-9/27/2010 stock for §57(a)(7) purposes. This skill defaults to the conservative position that §57(a)(7) DOES apply to the OBBBA 50% and 75% tiers. Escalate to reviewer for confirmation.

### 7.4 Section 1411 NIIT

The 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax under §1411 applies to the taxable portion of QSBS gain (the portion NOT excluded by §1202). For 100%-exclusion stock, the entire excluded amount is exempt from NIIT (because there's no income to tax). For partial-exclusion stock, the taxable portion is NII. Above the per-issuer cap, the excess is also NII.

## 8. Gifting, Estate Planning, and §1202 Stacking

### 8.1 Tacking under §1202(h)

§1202(h) provides that QSBS character and holding period **tack** through:
- Gift (§1202(h)(1)(A)) — donee tacks donor's holding period.
- Death (§1202(h)(1)(B)) — heir tacks decedent's holding period; QSBS basis is NOT stepped up under §1014 because §1202 is a recognition rule, not a basis rule. Actually — and this is a subtlety — the §1014 basis step-up DOES apply (death triggers FMV basis), but the §1202 character is preserved per §1202(h)(1)(B). The interplay: the step-up reduces the gain on a later sale, but to the extent gain remains (e.g., post-death appreciation), §1202 excludes it up to the cap.
- Distribution from partnership to partner under §1202(h)(2) — see Section 8.4.

### 8.2 Family stacking strategy

Because the §1202(b) per-issuer cap is **per taxpayer**, a founder who gifts QSBS to family members (or trusts for their benefit) creates additional caps:

- Founder: $15M cap.
- Spouse (if QSBS held separately as separate property): $15M cap (married-filing-jointly couples share a single cap if the QSBS is jointly held — gift to spouse creates separate property if structured correctly).
- Each child: $15M cap.
- Each non-grantor trust for benefit of a child: potentially $15M cap (with caveats — see Section 8.3).

**Worked stacking example.** Founder has 1M QSBS shares with $1,000 total basis, anticipated exit at $200/share = $200M proceeds, $199.999M gain.
- No stacking: $15M excluded, $185M taxable LTCG.
- 4-person stack (founder + spouse + 2 kids): pre-sale gift 250k shares each to spouse and 2 kids (3 separate non-grantor trusts for the kids if minor children). Each holder claims $15M cap = $60M total excluded; $140M taxable LTCG.
- **Tax savings**: $45M of additional exclusion × ~23.8% federal LTCG+NIIT = ~$10.7M federal saved (plus state if conforming).

### 8.3 Trust stacking — the caveats

Trust stacking is the most aggressive §1202 planning technique. The IRS has signaled in informal commentary (no formal guidance) that it scrutinizes:

- **Multiple trusts with substantially identical terms and beneficiaries**: §643(f) trust-aggregation rule may collapse multiple trusts created for tax-avoidance purposes into a single trust with a single $15M cap. The §643(f) regulations (T.D. 9913, finalized in 2020) require a "principal purpose of tax avoidance" — a fact-and-circumstances test.
- **Grantor trusts**: a grantor trust is the grantor for income tax purposes (§671), so the grantor and the trust share a single $15M cap. To create a separate cap, the trust must be a non-grantor trust (typically a "Dynasty Trust" or "Beneficiary Deemed Owner Trust" structured to be non-grantor).
- **Gift tax**: gifts of QSBS use the donor's lifetime gift exemption ($13.99M for 2025, scheduled to remain elevated under OBBBA Section TBD). Gifts exceeding the annual exclusion ($19,000 for 2025) require Form 709. The gift is valued at the QSBS FMV at the date of gift; for early-stage company stock, this can be very low.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — §643(f) aggregation.** Stacking strategies involving 4+ trusts created in close temporal proximity to a known liquidity event will draw §643(f) scrutiny. The defense: each trust serves a distinct, non-tax purpose (asset protection, generation-skipping, specific beneficiary needs), is funded with different assets, has different trustees, and has different terms beyond the §1202 stacking. Document the non-tax purposes contemporaneously, not after the fact.

### 8.4 Partnership distribution under §1202(h)(2)

If a partnership holds QSBS and distributes the QSBS to a partner, the partner takes the QSBS with §1202 character preserved, but only if the partner was a partner in the partnership at the time the partnership acquired the QSBS and continuously thereafter. The partner's share is determined by the partner's smallest interest in the partnership during that period (§1202(h)(2)(C)).

## 9. State Conformity (Tax Year 2025)

State conformity to §1202 is highly variable and changes with state legislative cycles. The summary below reflects state law as of 2025-11-15.

| State | Conformity | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| California | **Does NOT conform.** | R&TC §17131 specifically denies §1202 conformity. CA fully taxes the excluded gain at the CA marginal rate (up to 13.3%, plus 1% mental health surcharge over $1M MAGI). This is the single largest state-conformity gap for CA-resident founders. |
| New York | Conforms with modifications. | NY conforms to federal §1202 but only for QSBS issued by corporations meeting certain NY-specific criteria. Verify with NY-specific analysis. |
| New Jersey | **Does NOT conform.** | NJ has no parallel exclusion. |
| Massachusetts | Conforms for stock acquired after 1/1/2011 with 3% Massachusetts SSTB-equivalent test. | MA-resident founders may need to satisfy both federal and MA tests. |
| Washington | No state income tax on individuals; no §1202 conformity question. | The 7% WA capital gains tax (enacted 2021, effective 2022) **applies to QSBS gain** to the extent not excluded federally — the WA tax has its own $250k standard exemption per individual but does NOT incorporate §1202. |
| Texas | No state income tax on individuals; no §1202 conformity question. | |
| Florida | No state income tax on individuals; no §1202 conformity question. | |
| Pennsylvania | **Does NOT conform.** | PA personal income tax has its own capital gains regime with no §1202 analog. |
| Mississippi | **Does NOT conform.** | |
| Alabama | Conforms with modifications. | |
| Illinois | Conforms. | |
| Other states | Generally conform (about 35 states) but verify. | |

> **PRACTITIONER NOTE — the CA non-conformity gotcha.** A CA-resident founder selling QSBS will pay ~13.3% CA tax on the entire gain plus ~23.8% federal on the portion above the per-issuer cap. For a $100M exit with $15M federally excluded:
> - Federal: ($100M − $15M) × 23.8% = $20.23M.
> - California: $100M × ~13.3% = $13.3M (no exclusion).
> - Combined: $33.53M of $100M, or ~33.5%.
> Pre-sale relocation to a non-income-tax state (TX, FL, NV, WA, WY, SD, TN) is a common planning move, but requires actual change of domicile under CA's strict residency rules (R&TC §17014 and FTB Pub. 1031). CA will pursue back taxes for residents who move "temporarily" to avoid the tax. Plan early and document the domicile change rigorously.

## 10. Events That Destroy QSBS

| Event | Effect on QSBS |
| --- | --- |
| C-corp converts to S-corp | QSBS destroyed prospectively from S-election date. Gain accrued before S-election may still qualify if the holding period at the time of S-election was already >90% of subsequent holding — fact-intensive, escalate. |
| C-corp converts to LLC taxed as partnership | QSBS destroyed prospectively. |
| Reorganization where holder receives non-QSBS stock | If the reorg is a §368(a)(1)(A)/(B)/(C)/(E)/(F) tax-free reorg and the holder receives stock in the acquiring corporation, QSBS character may carry over under §1202(h)(4) — but only if the acquiring corporation also satisfies §1202 requirements. Most public-company acquisitions kill QSBS because the acquirer fails the $75M gross-asset cap. |
| Cash-out merger | Treated as a sale at the merger date; §1202 applies if requirements satisfied at that date. |
| Significant redemption of >5% of stock from related parties within 2 years of issuance | §1202(c)(3): destroys QSBS for all holders, not just the redeemed party. This is an anti-abuse rule targeting "issue-and-redeem" schemes. The 5% test is computed by value. |
| Significant redemption of >2% of stock from same shareholder within 2 years either side of issuance | §1202(c)(3): destroys QSBS only for that shareholder. |
| Stock split, stock dividend | Preserved under §1202(f). Holding period tacks. |
| Recapitalization (§368(a)(1)(E)) | Preserved if all stock received is in same corp and corp still qualifies. |
| Issuance of new options or warrants | No effect on existing QSBS holders. New options, when exercised, start their own §1202 clock at exercise date. |
| Corporate dissolution | Treated as sale of stock; §1202 applies if holding period met. |
| Open-end RIC (mutual fund) holding QSBS | §1202(g) does NOT flow through to mutual fund shareholders. Mutual funds are categorically excluded from §1202. |
| Closed-end RIC | §1202(l) provides limited application — escalate. |

## 11. SAFE Notes, Convertible Notes, and Option Exercises — Clock-Start Mechanics

The single most common §1202 reviewer question is: **"When does the QSBS clock start?"** The answer depends on the form of the instrument and the timing of conversion or exercise.

### 11.1 Direct stock purchase at incorporation

Founder purchases common stock at par at incorporation for de minimis cash → **QSBS clock starts at issuance date.** This is the cleanest case.

### 11.2 §83(b) election on restricted stock

Founder receives restricted stock subject to vesting; files §83(b) election within 30 days → **QSBS clock starts at issuance date** (the §83(b) election causes the stock to be treated as issued and held for §1202 purposes from the date of grant).

Without §83(b) election → QSBS clock starts at vesting date for each tranche. This delay is one of the most expensive §1202 mistakes for founders who fail to file §83(b).

### 11.3 SAFEs and convertible notes

A SAFE (Simple Agreement for Future Equity) or convertible note is **not stock** until it converts. §1202(c) requires "stock" — SAFEs and convertible notes are debt or contractual rights, not stock.

**Clock start: at conversion**, not at SAFE/note issuance.

This is critical: an investor who buys a SAFE in 2024 and converts to preferred at a 2025 priced round starts the QSBS clock in 2025, not 2024. Five years from conversion to 100% exclusion (or three years to 50% post-OBBBA).

Some practitioners argue (with no clean statutory or regulatory support) that SAFEs that economically function as equity should start the clock at SAFE issuance. **This skill rejects that position** and defaults to clock start at conversion.

### 11.4 Stock options (ISO and NSO)

Stock options are **not stock** until exercised. The §1202 clock starts at **exercise date**, not at grant date.

Implications:
- An early employee with options vested over 4 years who exercises at exit fails the §1202 holding period entirely — the exercise date and sale date are simultaneous.
- An early employee who **early-exercises** options (exercising unvested options at low strike price, with §83(b) election) starts the QSBS clock at early-exercise date — this is the standard early-employee §1202 strategy.
- Cashless exercise at exit: the exercise and sale are simultaneous; no §1202 (but may qualify for §1045 rollover into new QSBS).

### 11.5 LLC-to-C-corp conversion

When an LLC (taxed as partnership) converts to a C-corp:
- Pre-conversion LLC interests are **not** QSBS.
- Post-conversion C-corp stock is QSBS only if all §1202(c) requirements are met at the conversion (treated as the issuance date).
- Holding period of LLC interest does NOT tack.
- Pre-conversion built-in gain is recognized at conversion under §721/§351 rules (depending on conversion structure); only post-conversion gain qualifies for §1202.

For founders planning a conversion, the timing matters: convert before significant valuation appreciation so the QSBS basis is low and the 10× basis cap is small, then ride the appreciation under §1202.

### 11.6 §351 incorporation with contributed property

If a founder incorporates by contributing appreciated property under §351:
- The C-corp's stock received in the §351 exchange is QSBS only to the extent the contributed property's FMV did not exceed the corp's gross-asset cap at issuance.
- The stock's basis under §358 is the founder's basis in the contributed property; **but** for §1202(b)(1)(B) 10× basis cap purposes, the basis is the FMV at contribution (§1202(i)) — this can substantially expand the 10× cap.

Example: Founder contributes IP valued at $10M to new C-corp in exchange for stock with §358 basis of $0 (zero adjusted basis in IP). The 10× basis cap for §1202 purposes uses $10M FMV, so 10× = $100M. Combined with the $15M absolute cap, the greater of $15M or $100M = $100M cap. Substantial planning value.

---

## 12. Form 8949 Code Q and Schedule D Reporting

### 12.1 Reporting mechanics

QSBS gain is reported on Form 8949 with code **"Q"** in column (f). The exclusion is shown as a negative adjustment in column (g).

- Column (a): description of property (corporation name and number of shares).
- Column (b): date acquired.
- Column (c): date sold.
- Column (d): proceeds.
- Column (e): cost or other basis.
- Column (f): code "Q".
- Column (g): negative adjustment for excluded gain (shown as a negative number).
- Column (h): net gain after exclusion.

The net amount in column (h) carries to Schedule D Line 8b or 12 depending on holding period categorization.

### 12.2 §1045 rollover reporting

§1045 rollover is reported on Form 8949 with code "R" in column (f), with a negative adjustment in column (g) for the deferred gain. A statement must be attached identifying the replacement QSBS and the §1045 election under Rev. Proc. 98-48.

### 12.3 Per-issuer cap tracking

The taxpayer must maintain a running tally of §1202 exclusion claimed from each issuer across all years. Once the $15M (or $10M pre-OBBBA) cumulative cap is reached for an issuer, no further exclusion is available from that issuer.

For partial-exclusion years (50% or 75% post-OBBBA), the cumulative cap is reduced by the **excluded portion only**, not the total gain. So a taxpayer at the 50% tier who excludes $5M of $10M total gain has used $5M of the $15M cap.

---

## 13. Three Worked Examples

### 13.1 Example 1 — Founder, $500M exit (post-OBBBA)

**Facts.**
- Founder Anya incorporates a SaaS company in 2025 (post-OBBBA), receiving 5,000,000 shares of common stock at par for $5,000 total.
- Files §83(b) election within 30 days of issuance.
- Company is a domestic C-corp; gross assets at issuance: $5,000.
- Company satisfies §1202(c) requirements throughout.
- In 2032 (7 years later), company is acquired for $100/share = $500M total to Anya.
- Anya is a Texas resident at the time of sale.

**§1202 analysis.**

- Holding period: 7 years → 100% exclusion tier (post-OBBBA).
- Gain: $500,000,000 − $5,000 = $499,995,000.
- §1202(b)(1) per-issuer cap: greater of $15M or 10 × $5,000 = max($15M, $50,000) = **$15,000,000**.
- Excluded gain: $15,000,000.
- Taxable LTCG: $499,995,000 − $15,000,000 = $484,995,000.

**Federal tax.**
- LTCG at 20%: $484,995,000 × 20% = $96,999,000.
- NIIT at 3.8%: $484,995,000 × 3.8% = $18,429,810.
- AMT: zero (100% exclusion stock, post-9/27/2010 regime).
- **Total federal: $115,428,810** on $499,995,000 gain (effective rate ~23.1%).

**State tax.**
- Texas: zero state income tax.

**§1202 savings vs no §1202.**
- Without §1202: ($499,995,000) × 23.8% = $118,998,810.
- With §1202: $115,428,810.
- Savings: $3,570,000 (only the cap-limited $15M × 23.8% = $3.57M).

**Counterfactual — Anya is a CA resident.**
- CA does not conform: $499,995,000 × 13.3% = $66,499,335.
- Federal unchanged: $115,428,810.
- Combined: $181,928,145.
- The CA non-conformity costs $66.5M of state tax on gain that's federally excluded — escalation to CA pre-sale relocation planning.

### 13.2 Example 2 — Early employee, $25M exit (mixed pre/post-OBBBA)

**Facts.**
- Employee Ben joined a Series A startup in 2022 (pre-OBBBA).
- Early-exercised NSOs in 2022 for $250,000 ($250k basis), filed §83(b).
- Company gross assets at exercise: $30M (under pre-OBBBA $50M cap).
- Sells stock in 2027 (5 years and 2 months after exercise) for $25M in an acquisition.
- Ben is a Washington state resident.

**§1202 analysis.**

- Stock acquired pre-OBBBA → pre-OBBBA rules apply: $10M cap, 5-year cliff.
- Holding period: 5+ years → 100% exclusion.
- Gain: $25,000,000 − $250,000 = $24,750,000.
- §1202(b)(1) per-issuer cap: greater of $10M (pre-OBBBA) or 10 × $250,000 = max($10M, $2.5M) = **$10,000,000**.
- Excluded gain: $10,000,000.
- Taxable LTCG: $24,750,000 − $10,000,000 = $14,750,000.

**Federal tax.**
- LTCG at 20%: $14,750,000 × 20% = $2,950,000.
- NIIT at 3.8%: $14,750,000 × 3.8% = $560,500.
- AMT: zero.
- **Total federal: $3,510,500**.

**State tax.**
- Washington 7% capital gains tax: Washington does not conform to §1202. Gain over the $250k WA standard exemption (2025 inflation-adjusted figure ~$270k) is taxed at 7%.
- WA tax: ($24,750,000 − $270,000) × 7% = $1,714,100.
- (Note: WA's "long-term capital gains" tax is technically an excise tax, not income tax, and was upheld by the WA Supreme Court in *Quinn v. State*, 2023.)

**Total combined: $5,224,600** on $24.75M gain (~21.1%).

### 13.3 Example 3 — Family stacking, $200M exit (post-OBBBA)

**Facts.**
- Founder Carla incorporates a healthtech SaaS company in 2025 (post-OBBBA). Note: company sells software to hospital IT departments; does NOT provide medical services. §1202(e)(3) "health" exclusion does NOT apply — confirmed by reviewer analysis of revenue streams (95% software license, 5% implementation training, no direct patient care).
- Receives 1,000,000 shares for $1,000 at incorporation.
- Files §83(b).
- In 2026 (pre-liquidity, FMV $5/share), Carla gifts 250,000 shares each to: spouse Dan (separate property in a community-property-state pre-nup), and to two non-grantor dynasty trusts for the benefit of their two minor children (one trust per child, with distinct trustees, distinct beneficiary classes, and documented non-tax purposes — asset protection and GST planning).
- Gift tax: 4 gifts of $1,250,000 each ($5/share × 250k shares); using annual exclusions ($19k × 2 spouses × 4 donees = $152k) and lifetime exemption ($13.99M × 2 = $27.98M); Form 709 filed; remaining exemption: ~$23M.
- Holding period tacks under §1202(h)(1)(A).
- In 2030 (5+ years from 2025 issuance), company is acquired for $200/share = $200M total.
- All five holders sell their respective shares simultaneously.

**§1202 analysis per holder.**

| Holder | Shares | Basis | Proceeds | Gain | §1202(b)(1) cap | Excluded | Taxable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carla | 0 (after gifts to children, gift to spouse, retained ?) — let's recompute. |

Re-doing the cap-table cleanly:

- Carla retained 1,000,000 − 750,000 gifted = 250,000 shares.

Hmm — that's only 4 holders. Let me restructure: Carla gifts to spouse Dan, and to one trust per child (2 trusts), retains balance herself = 4 holders total.

| Holder | Shares retained | Basis | Proceeds at $200/share | Gain | §1202(b)(1) cap (greater of $15M or 10× basis) | Excluded | Taxable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Carla | 250,000 | $250 | $50,000,000 | $49,999,750 | max($15M, $2,500) = $15M | $15,000,000 | $34,999,750 |
| Dan (spouse) | 250,000 | $250 | $50,000,000 | $49,999,750 | $15M | $15,000,000 | $34,999,750 |
| Trust 1 (child A) | 250,000 | $250 | $50,000,000 | $49,999,750 | $15M | $15,000,000 | $34,999,750 |
| Trust 2 (child B) | 250,000 | $250 | $50,000,000 | $49,999,750 | $15M | $15,000,000 | $34,999,750 |
| **Total** | **1,000,000** | **$1,000** | **$200,000,000** | **$199,999,000** | — | **$60,000,000** | **$139,999,000** |

**Comparison — no stacking.**
- Carla holds all 1M shares.
- Gain: $199,999,000.
- §1202(b)(1) cap: max($15M, 10 × $1,000) = $15M.
- Excluded: $15M. Taxable: $184,999,000.

**Stacking saves $60M − $15M = $45M of additional exclusion.**
At 23.8% combined federal LTCG+NIIT, that's **$10,710,000 of federal tax savings**.

**State analysis.**
- If Carla and family are Florida residents: $0 state tax — full $10.71M federal savings captured.
- If Carla and family are CA residents: CA fully taxes all $200M of gain at marginal rates regardless of stacking — the stacking only captures federal savings, no CA savings.

**§643(f) risk assessment (Section 8.3).**
- Two trusts with distinct trustees, distinct beneficiaries (one per child), distinct asset-protection purposes, and distinct GST allocations.
- Each trust's terms differ beyond §1202 stacking: distribution standards differ, ages of mandatory principal distribution differ, trustee succession rules differ.
- Contemporaneous documentation of non-tax purposes (asset protection from minor's eventual creditors, GST shelter).
- **Defensible against §643(f) challenge** — but reviewer must confirm and engagement letter must disclose the audit risk.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT — pre-sale gifting.** The IRS scrutinizes QSBS gifts that occur close to a known liquidity event under both §643(f) (multiple trust aggregation) and the assignment-of-income doctrine. The defense: gifts must occur before there is a "fixed and determinable right" to sale proceeds. Practitioner threshold: gifts should occur before a binding letter of intent or definitive merger agreement; gifts after term sheet but before LOI are higher risk; gifts after LOI are at substantial risk of assignment-of-income recharacterization (*Salvatore v. Comm'r*, T.C. Memo 1970-30; *Ferguson v. Comm'r*, 174 F.3d 997 (9th Cir. 1999)). Document the timing rigorously.

## 14. Documentation Required

Reviewer must obtain and retain in the engagement file:

1. **Corporate formation documents**: certificate of incorporation, bylaws, organizational consent, original Form SS-4 EIN application showing C-corp election.
2. **Entity classification history**: Form 8832 elections (if any), Form 2553 S-elections (if any — should be NONE for QSBS), Form 1120 vs 1120-S filing history. Verify C-corp filing for every year of the holding period.
3. **Gross-asset balance sheets**: corp's balance sheet at adjusted basis at every issuance event the taxpayer participated in, plus immediately before and after each event. For multiple financing rounds, document each round's pre-money and post-money assets.
4. **Original stock issuance documentation**: stock subscription agreement, board resolution authorizing issuance, original stock certificate or electronic ledger entry showing taxpayer as direct purchaser from corp, payment receipt.
5. **§83(b) election** if applicable: copy of timely-filed §83(b) election with USPS-certified-mail receipt or IRS acknowledgment.
6. **Cap table history**: capitalization table at each financing round, conversion event, and the sale date.
7. **Trade-or-business analysis**: revenue breakdown by activity type (product vs services), employee roster, customer contracts (sample), website/marketing materials demonstrating product-vs-service character — to defend the §1202(e)(3) determination.
8. **Active business asset test workpapers**: corp's annual balance sheet with asset categorization (active business vs portfolio investment vs real property) for each year of the holding period; documentation of working capital intended for R&D/expansion within 2 years.
9. **Sale documentation**: closing statement showing proceeds, allocation of proceeds among consideration types (cash, stock, escrow, earnouts), date of closing.
10. **Per-issuer cap tracker**: spreadsheet showing cumulative §1202 exclusion claimed from each issuer across all years.
11. **§1045 election documentation** if applicable: timely-filed Form 8949 with code "R", statement under Rev. Proc. 98-48, replacement QSBS acquisition documentation.
12. **Gift/estate documentation** if applicable: Form 709 for gifts, valuation reports for QSBS at gift date, trust documents, donor/donee acknowledgments.
13. **State conformity analysis**: state-specific schedules for each state where the taxpayer was a resident during the holding period or at sale.

## 15. Reviewer Checklist (Run Before Sign-Off)

- [ ] Confirmed C-corp status at issuance and continuously during holding period (no S-election, no LLC conversion).
- [ ] Confirmed original-issuance acquisition (direct from corp, gift, inheritance, or qualifying partnership distribution).

## 17. Circular 230 Disclosure (Repeated)

This skill produces draft workpapers and analytical positions for review by a credentialed practitioner. Nothing here is a written opinion within §10.37 of Circular 230, is not marketed tax advice, and is not intended for taxpayer reliance to avoid penalties. Every §1202 position requires:

1. Documentary proof of all five §1202(c) requirements (Section 5).
2. A reviewer-confirmed §1202(e)(3) trade-or-business analysis (Section 5.5).
3. Reviewer confirmation of the per-issuer cap computation (Section 12.3).
4. Reviewer confirmation of state conformity treatment for each applicable state (Section 9).
5. For any §1045 rollover, reviewer confirmation that the election was timely filed (Section 6.1).
6. For any family stacking, reviewer confirmation of §643(f) defensibility and assignment-of-income defense (Sections 8.3 and 13.3 AUDIT FLASH POINTS).

The §1202 position is high-value, high-scrutiny. Take the conservative position whenever the record is incomplete and escalate to the credentialed reviewer.
