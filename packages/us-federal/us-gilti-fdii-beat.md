## 0. Scope

### 0.1 What this skill covers

This skill provides the technical content for the three flagship TCJA international anti-deferral / outbound provisions and the related compliance ecosystem, for the **2025 tax year (returns filed in 2026)**:

1. **GILTI — §951A** — Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income inclusion at the US shareholder level for income earned through CFCs.
2. **FDII — §250(a)(1)(A)** — Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction available to US C-corporations earning income from foreign customers.
3. **BEAT — §59A** — Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax on large US corporations making deductible payments to foreign related parties.
4. **Subpart F surviving rules — §951(a)** — pre-TCJA CFC inclusions that continue to apply on top of GILTI.
5. **§965 transition tax wind-down** — the eight-installment regime ending for most taxpayers in 2025.
6. **§962 election** — individual US shareholder corporate-rate election on Subpart F / GILTI inclusions.
7. **Pillar Two / GloBE / UTPR exposure** — coverage of the OECD framework that the US has chosen not to adopt domestically but which still affects US-parented MNEs through other jurisdictions' top-up taxes.
8. **Compliance forms** — 5471, 8992, 8993, 8991, with cross-references to 8865 / 8858 for foreign partnerships and disregarded entities.

### 0.2 What this skill does NOT cover (refer-outs)

### 0.3 OBBBA 2025 caveat (IMPORTANT)

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L. 119-21, enacted July 4, 2025) made selective changes to TCJA international provisions. As of the `last_updated` date on this skill, the following items are the consensus understanding but **MUST be verified against current IRS guidance and the final statute text** before issuing advice:

- OBBBA did **not** repeal the scheduled §250 deduction rate reductions for tax years beginning after Dec 31, 2025 (GILTI 50% → 37.5%; FDII 37.5% → 21.875%). The 2026 sunset to the lower deduction rates remains in effect for 2026.
- OBBBA did **not** adopt Pillar Two / GloBE domestically. US remains a non-adopter.
- BEAT rate scheduled increase to 12.5% for tax years beginning after Dec 31, 2025 remains in effect.
- BEAT credit ordering under §59A(b)(1)(B) for R&D and §38 GBC: pre-OBBBA the 80% usability rule for GBC credits (other than R&D) was scheduled to sunset; **verify whether OBBBA addressed this**. If a current-year BEAT computation depends on this point, **stop and require human reviewer input**.

> **Reviewer must verify all rate/effective-date claims in §§2.4, 3.4, 4.3, and 4.7 of this document against the operative version of the IRC and final Treasury regulations before relying on them for a 2025 return.**

## 1. Background — From Worldwide to Quasi-Territorial

### 1.1 Pre-TCJA system (returns through 2017)

Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-97), the United States operated a **worldwide income tax system**: a US corporation was taxed on its global income at 35%, with a credit for foreign taxes paid (§901, §902 deemed-paid credit), and **deferral** of US tax on active foreign-subsidiary income until the foreign subsidiary distributed a dividend back to the US parent.

The CFC anti-deferral regime under **Subpart F** (§§951–965, original enactment 1962) cracked down on passive and easily-shiftable income — interest, dividends, royalties, certain related-party services — by treating it as a deemed dividend to the US shareholder even without an actual distribution. But active manufacturing and services income earned abroad genuinely benefited from deferral.

This produced two well-documented distortions:

1. **Lock-out effect** — US MNEs accumulated >$2.6 trillion of unrepatriated foreign earnings by 2017 because bringing the cash home triggered US tax at 35%.
2. **Inversion incentive** — US corporations had a strong incentive to re-domicile abroad to escape the worldwide net.

### 1.2 TCJA's response (effective for tax years beginning after Dec 31, 2017)

TCJA enacted a package of provisions that shifted the US toward a **quasi-territorial** system:

| Provision | What it does |
|---|---|
| **§245A** Participation Exemption | 100% DRD on the foreign-source portion of dividends from 10%-owned foreign corporations (so future repatriations are US-tax-free) |
| **§965** Transition Tax | One-time tax on accumulated post-1986 foreign E&P (15.5% on liquid assets / 8% on illiquid), payable in 8 installments — cleans up the legacy lock-out |
| **§951A** GILTI | Global minimum tax on foreign intangible-return income — anti-deferral expansion |
| **§250(a)(1)(A)** GILTI deduction | 50% deduction so corporate effective rate = 10.5% pre-FTC |
| **§250(a)(1)(B)** FDII deduction | 37.5% deduction on foreign-derived income retained in a US corporation — incentive to keep IP in the US |
| **§59A** BEAT | Anti-base-erosion minimum tax on large corporations making deductible cross-border related-party payments |

The combination — participation exemption + GILTI + FDII + BEAT — was designed to make the system **broadly territorial** for active foreign earnings while imposing a **global minimum tax** on intangible/mobile income, and to penalize base-eroding outbound payments. **Subpart F still exists**; GILTI is layered on top.

### 1.3 Where Pillar Two fits

In 2021, the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework agreed on a global minimum tax framework (**Pillar Two / GloBE rules**) imposing a 15% minimum effective rate on MNE groups with consolidated revenue ≥ €750 million. Pillar Two has three operative mechanisms:

- **QDMTT** — Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (jurisdiction taxes its own low-taxed entities)
- **IIR** — Income Inclusion Rule (parent jurisdiction tops up its low-taxed subsidiaries)
- **UTPR** — Undertaxed Profits Rule (denial of deductions or equivalent tax in jurisdictions where related entities are low-taxed and not already topped up)

**The US has not adopted Pillar Two domestically.** OBBBA 2025 explicitly did not enact IIR, QDMTT, or UTPR. The US administration position is that GILTI is a sufficient global minimum tax for US-parented groups. The result: US MNEs face significant uncertainty because foreign jurisdictions may apply **UTPR** to top up US-parented group entities they consider low-taxed — even though the US-side GILTI inclusion may already be taxing the same income. See §6 below.

## 2. CFC Fundamentals and the US Shareholder Test

### 2.1 What is a Controlled Foreign Corporation?

A **Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC)** under **§957(a)** is a foreign corporation in which:

> US Shareholders together own (directly, indirectly, or constructively) more than **50%** of the total combined voting power OR more than **50%** of the total value of the stock, on any day during the taxable year of the foreign corporation.

Both the **vote** test and the **value** test are alternatives — a foreign corporation is a CFC if EITHER threshold is met.

### 2.2 What is a US Shareholder?

A **US Shareholder** under **§951(b)** (as amended by TCJA) is a US person who owns:

> **10% or more** of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote, OR **10% or more** of the total value of shares of all classes of stock.

> **TCJA change to flag:** Pre-TCJA, only the voting-power 10% test applied. TCJA added the value-based 10% test, expanding the US Shareholder population. This matters when foreign equity structures separate voting from economic rights (preferred shares, voting trusts).

A **US person** under §957(c) and §7701(a)(30) includes:
- US citizens (regardless of residence)
- US lawful permanent residents (green card holders)
- US resident aliens under the substantial presence test
- Domestic partnerships
- Domestic corporations
- Domestic trusts and estates meeting the §7701(a)(30)(E) tests

### 2.3 Constructive ownership — §958

Stock ownership is tested under three rules:

- **§958(a)** — direct + indirect (through foreign entities) ownership; this is the ownership that triggers Subpart F and GILTI inclusion amounts.
- **§958(b)** — constructive ownership rules (modified §318 family/entity attribution) used to determine **status** (Is the foreign corp a CFC? Is this person a US Shareholder?).

> **§958(b)(4) repeal trap:** TCJA repealed §958(b)(4), which had blocked downward attribution from foreign persons to US persons. After repeal, a foreign parent's stock in a foreign sister company can be attributed downward to a US subsidiary, making that foreign sister a CFC of the US subsidiary even though the US subsidiary owns zero direct shares in it. This is the so-called **"sister CFC"** problem and produces many surprise Form 5471 filings. Notice 2018-13 and Rev. Proc. 2019-40 provide limited safe harbors for "no economic ownership" situations but the trap is real.

### 2.4 Why the CFC test matters for this skill

- **Subpart F (§951(a))** — US Shareholders of a CFC must include their pro-rata share of CFC Subpart F income currently.
- **GILTI (§951A)** — US Shareholders of any CFC must include their pro-rata share of the CFC's "tested income" net of QBAI exclusion.
- **Form 5471** — Categories 4 (control) and 5 (US Shareholder of CFC) attach to the CFC determination.
- **§245A DRD** — Only available to US C-corp shareholders of "specified 10%-owned foreign corporations."

If a taxpayer is **NOT** a 10% US Shareholder, GILTI and Subpart F do not apply. Reporting may still be required (Categories 1, 2, 3 on Form 5471 for officer/director/transfer events).

---

## 3. GILTI — §951A

### 3.1 Conceptual overview

GILTI is a minimum tax on the **intangible return** of CFCs. The statute does not actually try to measure intangible income directly. Instead, it:

1. Computes the CFC's "tested income" (broadly: gross income less ECI, less Subpart F, less high-taxed exclusion items, less allocable deductions).
2. Subtracts a **deemed routine return on tangible assets** equal to **10% × QBAI** (Qualified Business Asset Investment).
3. Treats whatever is left as the deemed "intangible" return that the US Shareholder must include in income.

In equation form:

```
For each CFC:
  Tested Income (or Tested Loss) = §951A(c)(2)
  QBAI = avg adjusted basis of specified tangible property used in producing tested income

US Shareholder GILTI inclusion:
  GILTI = Net CFC Tested Income − Net Deemed Tangible Income Return (NDTIR)
  where
    Net CFC Tested Income = sum of pro-rata tested income − sum of pro-rata tested losses
    NDTIR = 10% × pro-rata QBAI − specified interest expense
```

Note that QBAI is calculated **before** the 10% multiplier — the 10% is applied to the QBAI basis to produce the routine-return floor.

### 3.2 Tested income — §951A(c)(2)

The CFC's **tested income** is its gross income, **excluding**:

| Exclusion | Statute | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Effectively connected income (ECI) | §951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(I) | ECI is already in the US net |
| Subpart F income | §951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(II) | Already picked up under §951 — no double inclusion |
| Income excluded from FBC income / insurance income by §954(b)(4) high-tax election | §951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(III) | GILTI high-tax exception |
| Dividends from related persons (under §954(d)(3)) | §951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(IV) | Avoids cascade |
| Foreign oil and gas extraction income (FOGEI) | §951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(V) | Carve-out for natural resource sector |

The **§954(b)(4) GILTI high-tax exception** (Treas. Reg. §1.951A-2(c)(7)) allows a US Shareholder to elect to exclude tested income from a CFC where the foreign effective tax rate exceeds **18.9%** (90% of the 21% US corporate rate). The election is made on a "tested unit" basis annually. Important planning lever for CFCs in high-tax jurisdictions — explicit election on the timely-filed return.

After exclusions, allocable deductions reduce tested income to net tested income (or a tested loss).

### 3.3 QBAI — §951A(d)

**Qualified Business Asset Investment** is the **average of the aggregate adjusted bases** of "specified tangible property" used in the production of tested income, computed on a **quarterly average basis**.

Specified tangible property:
- Tangible property
- Of a character subject to depreciation under §167
- Used in the trade or business of the CFC
- Used in the production of tested income (allocable portion only if mixed-use)

Critically, **adjusted basis is computed under the alternative depreciation system (ADS) of §168(g)** (straight-line over class life), **not** regular MACRS. This usually produces a higher remaining basis (slower depreciation), which **increases** QBAI and **decreases** GILTI. The election is mandatory — there is no choice between methods for QBAI purposes.

Excluded from QBAI:
- Land (not depreciable)
- Inventory
- Intangibles
- Property held by a partnership unless the CFC's distributive share is computed through

The 10% routine return is the legislative judgment that a normal-return business should not be taxed on its first 10% pretax return on tangible asset basis. Beyond that, the income is treated as intangible-derived.

### 3.4 §250 GILTI deduction (C-corps only)

A **domestic C-corporation** US Shareholder gets a deduction under **§250(a)(1)(B)** equal to:

| Tax year beginning | GILTI deduction % | Effective rate (21% × (1 − %)) |
|---|---|---|
| 2018–2025 | **50%** | **10.5%** |
| **2026 onward (TCJA sunset)** | **37.5%** | **13.125%** |

This deduction is taken on **Form 8993** ("Section 250 Deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income (FDII) and Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI)").

> **Taxable income limitation (§250(a)(2)):** The combined GILTI + FDII deduction cannot exceed the corporation's taxable income (computed without regard to §250 itself). If the limitation bites, the deduction is reduced **pro rata** between GILTI and FDII components. This commonly affects loss-year corporations and is a place where small drafting errors produce wrong returns.

### 3.5 §960(d) GILTI foreign tax credit — IMPORTANT FEATURES

A domestic C-corporation US Shareholder is treated under **§960(d)** as having paid **80%** of the foreign income taxes properly attributable to the GILTI inclusion (the "tested foreign income taxes" of each CFC, multiplied by the inclusion-percentage fraction).

Three critical features:

1. **80% haircut.** Only 80% of foreign taxes are creditable, not 100%. This is why even GILTI from a fully-foreign-taxed CFC at, say, 13.125% foreign rate is not perfectly offset — the 20% haircut leaves a residual US tax.
2. **Separate basket.** GILTI sits in its **own §904 limitation basket** (the "GILTI basket"). It cannot be averaged with general-basket or passive-basket income to soak up excess credits there.
3. **No carryback or carryforward.** Unlike the general and passive baskets (10-year carryforward, 1-year carryback), the GILTI basket has **no carrybacks and no carryforwards**. Excess GILTI FTCs are permanently lost in the year they arise.

The deemed-paid foreign tax is:

```
Deemed-paid tax = Inclusion Percentage × Tested Foreign Income Taxes
where
  Inclusion Percentage = (US Shareholder's GILTI inclusion / Aggregate Tested Income of all CFCs)
Creditable amount = 80% × Deemed-paid tax  [§960(d)(1)]
```

The deemed-paid tax is "grossed up" into the GILTI inclusion under **§78** (so the GILTI inclusion that hits Schedule J is the inclusion **plus** the deemed-paid tax, before the deduction and credit).

> **Break-even foreign tax rate to fully offset US tax on GILTI (pre-2026):**  
> 21% × (1 − 50%) = 10.5% US tax.  
> 80% × foreign rate must ≥ 10.5%, so foreign rate must ≥ **13.125%**.  
> **If a CFC's effective foreign rate is at least 13.125%, US residual GILTI tax is zero** (subject to expense allocation against the GILTI basket — see below).

### 3.6 Expense allocation against the GILTI basket (the trap)

Under §861-§865 rules and Treas. Reg. §1.861-8, US Shareholder expenses (notably interest expense and stewardship/R&D expense) must be **apportioned** between baskets. Some of these expenses get apportioned to the GILTI basket, **reducing** the §904 limitation in that basket.

The trap: a US C-corp parent with substantial debt at the US level may find that significant interest expense is allocated to GILTI, shrinking the GILTI §904 limitation **below** the GILTI inclusion. The deemed-paid foreign taxes are then capped, and because there's **no carryforward**, the unused FTC is gone forever. Net result: a residual US tax on GILTI even when the foreign effective rate well exceeds 13.125%.

Mitigation strategies (each requires its own analysis):
- §954(b)(4) high-tax exclusion election to exclude the high-taxed tested income from GILTI altogether
- Restructuring debt to push it offshore
- §163(j) interaction
- Restructuring CFC ownership chains to align expense

### 3.7 Individual US Shareholders — the problem and the §962 election

An **individual** US Shareholder of a CFC has the **same GILTI inclusion** as a corporate shareholder, but:

- **No §250 deduction.** §250 is explicitly limited to "domestic corporations." Individuals do not get the 50% (or 37.5%) deduction.
- **No §960(d) deemed-paid credit.** The deemed-paid FTC under §960 is also corporate-only.
- **Ordinary rates apply.** GILTI is includible as ordinary income, subject to graduated individual rates up to 37% (plus 3.8% NIIT under §1411 in many cases).

So an individual sitting on top of a CFC in, say, Singapore (17% statutory) can face a US federal rate of **37% + 3.8% = 40.8%** on GILTI, with **no foreign tax credit available for the corporate-level Singapore tax** — a brutal mismatch.

### 3.8 The §962 election

**§962** allows an individual US Shareholder to elect to be **taxed as if a domestic corporation** on §951(a) (Subpart F) and §951A (GILTI) inclusions. Effects:

| Without §962 | With §962 |
|---|---|
| 37% top rate + 3.8% NIIT | 21% corporate rate (no NIIT because §962 income is treated as corporate) |
| No §250 deduction | 50% §250 deduction available (effective 10.5%, sunsets to 13.125% in 2026) |
| No §960 deemed-paid FTC | §960(d) deemed-paid FTC available (80% creditable) |

**Catch:** Distributions from the CFC that come from §962 PTEP (previously taxed earnings and profits) are **NOT** tax-free under §959 to the extent of the §962 tax paid. Specifically, the actual distribution of the underlying earnings to the individual is taxable as a **qualified dividend** (potentially) under the regular dividend rules to the extent it exceeds the original §962 tax paid. Under Smith v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2018-127 (and subsequent guidance — see Rev. Rul. 62-165 and the 2019 proposed regs), the post-§962 distribution is generally taxed as a dividend but the underlying §962 tax paid creates a basis offset for the portion previously taxed.

The §962 election is therefore **most valuable** when:
- The CFC pays significant foreign income tax (so the 80% deemed-paid credit substantially offsets the 21% rate);
- The individual does not expect to take large dividend distributions in the near term;
- The CFC is in a moderately-taxed jurisdiction.

It is **less valuable** (or harmful) when:
- The CFC pays no foreign tax (you've still effectively paid 21% with no credit and now face dividend tax on top later);
- Distributions are imminent (double-tax stacking).

> **§962 election mechanics:** Made annually on a statement attached to the timely-filed (with extensions) return. See Treas. Reg. §1.962-2. Cannot be made on an amended return. Election applies to all CFCs of the electing individual for that year — cannot pick and choose.

---

## 4. FDII — §250(a)(1)(A)

### 4.1 Purpose

While GILTI taxes **foreign-subsidiary** income, FDII gives a **deduction** for **US-corporation** income earned from **foreign customers**, **provided** the foreign customer uses the property or services for **foreign use**. The economic intent: equalize the after-tax outcome of holding IP in a US corporation vs. holding it in a CFC. A US C-corp that earns export income on US-held IP gets the FDII deduction; if the same IP were in a CFC, the income would be GILTI. The two deductions ($250 GILTI deduction at 50% and §250 FDII deduction at 37.5%) are calibrated so the US-domestic outcome (13.125%) is slightly **better** than the offshore outcome (10.5% pre-FTC haircut, but with FTC limits in practice often higher).

### 4.2 Eligibility

FDII is available **only to domestic C-corporations**.

- **Not** S-corporations
- **Not** partnerships
- **Not** individuals
- **Not** RICs / REITs

A US C-corp that is itself a CFC partner or has CFC subsidiaries can still claim FDII on its own foreign-derived income.

### 4.3 The formula

The mechanics under Treas. Reg. §1.250(b)-1 et seq.:

```
Step 1: DEI (Deduction Eligible Income)
  DEI = Gross Income − certain exclusions − allocable deductions
  Exclusions: Subpart F, GILTI, financial services income, dividends from CFCs,
              domestic O&G extraction income, foreign branch income

Step 2: DII (Deemed Intangible Income)
  DII = DEI − 10% × QBAI
  (Same 10% routine return concept, applied at the US C-corp level on its
   own QBAI)

Step 3: FDDEI (Foreign-Derived Deduction Eligible Income)
  FDDEI = portion of DEI that comes from:
    (a) sale of property to a foreign person FOR FOREIGN USE, or
    (b) services provided to a person located OUTSIDE the US

Step 4: FDII
  FDII = DII × (FDDEI / DEI)

Step 5: §250(a)(1)(A) deduction
  FDII deduction = 37.5% × FDII  [2018–2025]
                 = 21.875% × FDII  [2026 onward — TCJA sunset]
```

The **effective rate** on FDII-qualifying income for a 21% corporation:

| Tax year beginning | FDII deduction % | Effective rate |
|---|---|---|
| 2018–2025 | **37.5%** | **13.125%** |
| **2026 onward** | **21.875%** | **16.406%** |

> Combined §250 deduction (GILTI + FDII) is taken on **Form 8993**.

### 4.4 "Foreign use" — the documentation problem

Under Treas. Reg. §1.250(b)-4 and §1.250(b)-5, "foreign use" means use, consumption, or disposition outside the US. The hard cases:

| Transaction | Foreign use? | Documentation challenge |
|---|---|---|
| Sale of widgets to a foreign distributor for resale abroad | Yes | Need evidence buyer is foreign person + product leaves US |
| Sale to a foreign affiliate that then sells back into US | **No** (round-tripping disqualifies) | Need to trace ultimate end-use |
| Cloud services accessed by a foreign user | Yes if the user is located abroad | IP address logs, contract recitals, billing address — see §1.250(b)-5(d) |
| Sale of intangibles (license) to a foreign licensee using IP in mixed jurisdictions | Pro-rata | Allocate by territory of use |
| Sale of digital content to a consumer | Foreign use if delivered to non-US end consumer | Subject to specific "general services" vs. "advertising" vs. "intangible" classification rules |

Documentation requirements under Treas. Reg. §1.250(b)-3(d) are **substantial**: for B2B sales and general services to a business recipient, the taxpayer needs **contemporaneous documentation** establishing the foreign person status and foreign use. The regulations distinguish "small business" (≤$25M FDII gross receipts) with reduced documentation rules from larger taxpayers.

**Common failure mode:** taxpayer claims FDII based on counterparty address but lacks the §1.250(b)-3 documentation. On audit, the FDDEI is disallowed. Reviewer should confirm the documentation file exists and is contemporaneous (not assembled at filing time).

### 4.5 FDII anti-stuffing rules

Several anti-abuse rules:

- **Related-party sales (Treas. Reg. §1.250(b)-6):** Sales to a foreign related party qualify as FDDEI only if the related party then sells to an unrelated foreign person for foreign use (look-through).
- **Round-tripping:** Sales of property that ultimately return to US use are disqualified.
- **Manufactured-good carve-out:** Property "manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted" must satisfy the foreign-use rules at the end of the supply chain.

### 4.6 Interaction with R&D capitalization §174

For tax years beginning after Dec 31, 2021, §174 (post-TCJA) requires **capitalization and amortization** of R&E expenditures (5 years domestic, 15 years foreign). The OBBBA 2025 reinstated **immediate expensing for domestic R&E** for tax years beginning after Dec 31, 2024 (subject to confirmation). This affects FDII because:

- §174 capitalization shifts R&E expense from a current deduction into amortization over time.
- DEI for FDII purposes is **gross income less allocable deductions**, so R&E that is capitalized rather than deducted **increases** current-year DEI and therefore current-year FDII.
- The expensing reinstatement under OBBBA may reduce current FDII for taxpayers with heavy domestic R&E.

> **Reviewer must verify the operative §174 rules for the tax year being prepared.** This is a fast-moving area.

### 4.7 FDII §250(a)(2) taxable income limitation

As noted for GILTI, the combined §250 deduction (GILTI + FDII) cannot exceed taxable income (computed without §250). Excess is allocated pro rata. A loss-year US C-corp gets no §250 deduction even if it has substantial FDDEI.

---

## 5. BEAT — §59A

### 5.1 Purpose

BEAT is an **anti-base-erosion minimum tax**. It addresses the practice of large US corporations making deductible payments (interest, royalties, services fees) to foreign related parties, eroding the US tax base. BEAT effectively says: if too much of your deductible expense goes to foreign related parties, you must compute a parallel minimum tax that **adds back** those payments and compare against regular tax.

### 5.2 Who is subject — the gateway tests

A taxpayer is an **"applicable taxpayer"** under §59A(e) if:

1. It is a corporation other than a RIC, REIT, or S-corporation; AND
2. Its **average annual gross receipts** for the 3 prior tax years are **at least $500 million** (the "gross receipts test"); AND
3. Its **base erosion percentage** for the tax year is at least:
   - **3%** for most corporations, or
   - **2%** for banks and registered securities dealers (and their affiliated groups).

Aggregation rules under §59A(e)(3) apply: members of a §52(a)/(b) controlled group are aggregated for the gross receipts test.

> Small and mid-market US corporations (<$500M average gross receipts) are categorically **outside** BEAT and need not analyze it further. Most freelance / small-business engagements never touch BEAT. This skill covers it for completeness and for any engagements that involve a US sub of a foreign-parented MNE or a large US-parented group.

### 5.3 Base erosion payments — §59A(d)

A **base erosion payment** is any amount paid or accrued by the taxpayer to a foreign related party that is either:

1. Allowable as a deduction (interest, royalties, services fees, rent, etc.), OR
2. A payment to acquire depreciable or amortizable property (the deduction/amortization stream is treated as base-eroding), OR
3. A premium or other consideration for reinsurance, OR
4. Certain payments to expatriated entities under §7874 (always counted regardless of foreign-related status).

**Foreign related party** under §59A(g) means a party related under §267(b)/(c) or §707(b) modified, generally requiring **25% common ownership**.

### 5.4 Carve-outs from base erosion payments

Important carve-outs (do not count as base erosion payments):

- **COGS** — Cost of goods sold is generally **not** a deduction (it's a reduction in gross receipts) and is therefore **excluded** from base erosion payments. This is a huge carve-out for goods-import businesses.
- **Services Cost Method (SCM) exception §59A(d)(5):** Services that qualify under the SCM under Treas. Reg. §1.482-9(b) and are charged at cost (no markup) are excluded — but ONLY the cost component; any markup is a base erosion payment.
- **Qualified derivative payments** under §59A(h) — mark-to-market derivative settlements meeting the regulatory criteria.
- **Effectively connected income (ECI) of the foreign related party**, where the recipient is itself paying US tax on the income — this prevents double-taxing.
- **Payments subject to full US gross-basis withholding** under §1441/§1442 are excluded to the extent withholding applies.

### 5.5 Base erosion percentage

```
Base Erosion Percentage =
   Base Erosion Tax Benefits (this year)
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   All deductions allowed this year + base erosion tax benefits
   (with various exclusions per §59A(c)(4))
```

If this percentage ≥ 3% (2% for banks/securities dealers), the corporation is an applicable taxpayer.

### 5.6 BEAT computation — Modified Taxable Income and the BEAT rate

```
Modified Taxable Income (MTI):
  MTI = Taxable Income
        + Base Erosion Tax Benefits (the deductions / depreciation
                                     attributable to base erosion payments)
        + Base Erosion Percentage × NOL Deduction

BEAT Minimum Tax Amount:
  BEAT MTA = (BEAT Rate × MTI) − (Regular Tax Liability − certain credits)

BEAT liability = max(0, BEAT MTA)
```

| Tax year beginning | BEAT rate |
|---|---|
| 2018 | 5% |
| 2019–2025 | **10%** |
| **2026 onward (TCJA sunset)** | **12.5%** |

(Banks and registered securities dealers are subject to a +1 percentage point on each rate above.)

### 5.7 Credits — the BEAT-credit haircut

When computing "regular tax liability" in the BEAT formula, you **add back** certain credits — i.e., credits do **not** count as offsetting regular tax for BEAT purposes — which effectively reduces the "regular tax" floor and INCREASES BEAT liability.

Under §59A(b)(1)(B) and §59A(b)(2):

| Credit | Pre-2026 treatment | 2026 and later |
|---|---|---|
| §41 R&D credit | **Fully usable** against regular tax for BEAT comparison (not added back) | **Added back** (less favorable) |
| §38 General Business Credits (other than R&D) — §45 PTC, §48 ITC, §47, §45Q, §45V, §45X, etc. | **80% usable** (i.e., 20% is added back) | **Fully added back** |
| §47 Low-income housing credit and §42 (sub-component) | Same as other GBC: 80% (pre-2026), full add-back after | Same |

> **OBBBA 2025 may have modified the 2026 credit treatment.** As of `last_updated`, this skill assumes the TCJA sunset (full add-back post-2025) remains scheduled. **Verify before relying on this for a 2026 forecast.**

### 5.8 BEAT and NOLs

NOLs that arose in tax years beginning before Jan 1, 2018 are not subject to the BEAT-percentage haircut. NOLs from 2018-forward are subject to the §59A(c)(4) treatment: the **base erosion percentage** of the NOL deduction is added back to taxable income in computing MTI.

### 5.9 BEAT reporting — Form 8991

BEAT is reported on **Form 8991, "Tax on Base Erosion Payments of Taxpayers with Substantial Gross Receipts."** Filed with the corporate return (Form 1120). Required for any corporation meeting the gateway gross-receipts test, **even if base erosion percentage is below 3% / 2%**, to demonstrate non-application.

---

## 6. Subpart F — The Surviving Pre-TCJA Regime

### 6.1 GILTI does NOT replace Subpart F

Subpart F (§§951–965) continues to apply on top of GILTI. The ordering rule: **Subpart F applies first**, and Subpart F income is **excluded** from tested income for GILTI purposes (§951A(c)(2)(A)(i)(II)). So a CFC's gross income is allocated:

1. **First** to Subpart F categories (currently taxable to US Shareholder)
2. **Second**, any non-Subpart F, non-excluded income becomes **tested income** for GILTI
3. Routine return on QBAI is excluded; the rest is the GILTI inclusion

### 6.2 Subpart F income categories

The principal Subpart F categories (§952):

| Category | What it captures |
|---|---|
| **Foreign Personal Holding Company Income (FPHCI) §954(c)** | Dividends, interest, rents, royalties, gains on property producing passive income, certain commodity transactions, certain currency gains |
| **Foreign Base Company Sales Income (FBCSI) §954(d)** | Sales income where the CFC purchases or sells property to/from a related party AND the property is manufactured/sold outside the CFC's country of organization |
| **Foreign Base Company Services Income (FBCSvI) §954(e)** | Services performed outside the CFC's country of organization for or on behalf of a related party |
| **Insurance income §953** | Income from insuring risks located outside the CFC's country |

Various exclusions apply:
- **High-tax exception §954(b)(4):** Subpart F income subject to foreign effective tax ≥ 90% of US corporate rate (i.e., ≥18.9%) can be excluded by election.
- **Same-country exception §954(c)(3):** Certain related-party dividends, interest, rents, royalties received from a related person in the same country.
- **Active financing exception (AFE) §954(h):** Permanent exception (since PATH Act 2015) for certain qualifying banking, financing, and insurance income.
- **De minimis §954(b)(3)(A):** If gross FBC and insurance income is less than the lesser of 5% of gross income or $1M, none of it is Subpart F.
- **Full inclusion §954(b)(3)(B):** If gross FBC and insurance income is more than 70% of gross income, ALL gross income is Subpart F.

### 6.3 Practical interaction with GILTI

In most modern post-TCJA fact patterns, Subpart F is comparatively **narrow** (it never picked up active income) while GILTI is **broad** (catches active income above QBAI floor). Subpart F still matters because:

- It is includible at the US Shareholder's regular rate without the §250 deduction.
- The §954(b)(4) high-tax exception is operative and produces an unusual planning lever: forcing income into Subpart F and then electing out under high-tax exception may be better than letting it sit in GILTI subject to FTC haircut + no carryforward.
- For individual US Shareholders without a §962 election, both Subpart F and GILTI hit at ordinary rates — but Subpart F has a longer line of case law and developed planning patterns.

## 7. §965 Transition Tax Wind-Down

### 7.1 What §965 was

TCJA's §965 imposed a one-time tax on **accumulated post-1986 foreign E&P** of "specified foreign corporations" (broadly, CFCs and 10%-owned foreign corps), measured as of Nov 2, 2017 or Dec 31, 2017 (greater). The tax was at effective rates of:

- **15.5%** on the portion attributable to liquid assets (cash-position)
- **8%** on the illiquid portion

Computed via a deemed §965(a) inclusion with a corresponding §965(c) deduction calibrated to those effective rates.

### 7.2 The 8-installment election under §965(h)

US Shareholders could elect under **§965(h)** to pay the §965 net tax liability in **8 annual installments** as follows:

| Installment # | % of liability |
|---|---|
| 1 | 8% |
| 2 | 8% |
| 3 | 8% |
| 4 | 8% |
| 5 | 8% |
| 6 | 15% |
| 7 | 20% |
| 8 | **25%** |

For a calendar-year taxpayer who made the election with the 2017 return:
- Installment 1 was due with the 2017 return (April 2018)
- ...
- **Installment 8** is due with the 2024 return (April 2025) — i.e., the **2025 filing season** is the **final** installment for calendar-year filers.
- Fiscal-year taxpayers with non-calendar inclusion years may have a later final installment.

### 7.3 §965(i) S-corporation deferred election

S-corporation shareholders could elect under §965(i) to defer the §965 tax until a "triggering event" (sale of S-corp interest, S-corp ceasing to be a domestic corporation, etc.). Triggering events through 2025 are a meaningful tax exposure area — sale of an S-corp interest in 2025 by a shareholder who made a §965(i) election in 2017 can crystallize a large deferred tax liability.

### 7.4 Reporting

§965 inclusions, deductions, and installment payments are reported on **Form 965** and **Form 965-A/B**, attached to the Form 1040 or 1120 of the US Shareholder. **Final installment year** filers should ensure the installment schedule reconciles with prior years' Forms 965-A and the IRS systemic records.

## 8. Pillar Two / GloBE / UTPR

### 8.1 Framework recap

The OECD Inclusive Framework's **Pillar Two** establishes a **15% minimum effective tax rate** for MNE groups with consolidated revenue **≥ €750 million** in at least two of the last four fiscal years. The framework consists of:

| Rule | What it does | Where it operates |
|---|---|---|
| **QDMTT** — Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax | Jurisdiction taxes its own constituent entities to 15% | The low-tax jurisdiction itself |
| **IIR** — Income Inclusion Rule | Parent jurisdiction tops up its low-taxed subsidiaries | UPE (ultimate parent entity) jurisdiction |
| **UTPR** — Undertaxed Profits Rule | Backstop: denial of deductions or equivalent in jurisdictions where related entities are low-taxed and not topped up | Any jurisdiction with constituent entities |

QDMTTs and IIRs went live in many jurisdictions (EU member states, UK, South Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc.) for fiscal years beginning on or after **Jan 1, 2024**. UTPRs went live (or are scheduled live) for fiscal years beginning on or after **Jan 1, 2025** in many of those jurisdictions.

### 8.2 US position

The United States has **not adopted** Pillar Two as domestic law:

- No QDMTT
- No IIR (the US position is that GILTI is a substitute, but GILTI does not meet the OECD's "qualified IIR" tests in several technical respects — notably the per-jurisdiction blending vs. global blending issue, and the 80% FTC haircut)
- No UTPR
- **OBBBA 2025 did not change this.** The administration position (as of mid-2025) is to resist Pillar Two and oppose UTPR application to US groups, including threatening §891 retaliatory measures.

### 8.3 What this means for US-parented MNEs in 2025

Two distinct exposure tracks:

**Track A — UTPR exposure from foreign jurisdictions.** US-parented groups with consolidated revenue ≥ €750M have constituent entities (subsidiaries, branches) in jurisdictions that have enacted UTPR. For fiscal years starting on or after Jan 1, 2025, those foreign jurisdictions may impose UTPR top-up tax on the US-parented group to the extent any constituent entity is low-taxed (including potentially the US parent itself, if its US effective rate is below 15% — which is plausible for groups with heavy R&D credits, FDII deduction, GILTI deduction, etc.).

**Track B — QDMTT exposure in low-tax jurisdictions.** A US-parented group with a Hungarian, Singaporean, Irish (post-changes), or Swiss-canton subsidiary may face QDMTT top-up tax in those jurisdictions for 2024+ fiscal years.

> **Critical practical implication:** A US-parented group's 2025 federal tax computation does **not** include any Pillar Two top-up tax (because the US has not adopted). But the group's **consolidated financial statement tax provision** under ASC 740 must include any foreign QDMTT and IIR (and potentially UTPR). Cash tax payments may include foreign top-up taxes that have no US tax credit (because the US has not adopted creditability rules for Pillar Two and the OECD's "Qualified IIR" creditability is still developing). This is a major income-tax-accounting issue distinct from this skill's scope.

### 8.4 §891 retaliation overlay (flag for reviewer)

In early 2025, the administration directed Treasury and IRS to identify foreign tax laws that violate US tax treaties or are extraterritorial / discriminatory. **§891** authorizes the President to double US tax rates on residents and corporations of countries imposing discriminatory taxes on US persons. This power has never been formally invoked but the threat creates uncertainty. Reviewer should monitor IRS notices for any §891 finding affecting Pillar Two-adopting countries.

## 9. Compliance Forms Catalog

### 9.1 Form 5471 — Information Return of US Persons with Respect to Certain Foreign Corporations

The flagship CFC information return. **Five categories** of filers (Cat. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5):

| Category | Who files |
|---|---|
| **Cat. 1** | US Shareholders of "Section 965 Specified Foreign Corporations" (largely historical, but residual application for §965(i) S-corp deferred shareholders) |
| **Cat. 2** | US person who is an officer or director of a foreign corp where any US person acquires the §1248 ownership threshold during the year |
| **Cat. 3** | US person acquiring or disposing of 10% or more, or whose ownership crosses the 10% threshold |
| **Cat. 4** | US person with **>50% control** of the foreign corp for an uninterrupted 30-day period |
| **Cat. 5** | US Shareholder (10%+ vote or value) of a CFC for an uninterrupted 30-day period and who owns stock on the last day of the tax year |

Each category triggers different schedules. The 2025 Form 5471 contains 15+ schedules (Schedules A through Q, plus M, etc.). Notably:

- **Schedule I-1** — Information for GILTI (tested income, QBAI, etc.) — fed into Form 8992
- **Schedule J** — Accumulated E&P / PTEP tracking
- **Schedule P** — PTEP balances of the US Shareholder
- **Schedule M** — Transactions between CFC and related parties
- **Schedule Q** — CFC Income by CFC Income Group (Subpart F categories)

> **Penalty exposure (§6038):** $10,000 per form per year for failure to file, with continuation penalties up to $50,000 per form. Plus 10% reduction in FTCs available. The IRS automates assessment of these penalties — late or missing 5471s trigger systemic penalty notices. Reasonable-cause abatement is available but inconsistently granted; reviewer should ensure all 5471s are filed on time.
>
> **Farhy v. Commissioner, 160 T.C. No. 6 (2023)** held that the IRS lacked statutory authority to assess §6038(b) penalties without going through the deficiency procedures. The D.C. Circuit reversed in **2024** (Farhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223 (D.C. Cir. 2024)), holding that §6038(b) penalties **are** assessable. Practical impact: the IRS continues to auto-assess. Don't rely on Farhy for a filing-position decision.

### 9.2 Form 8992 — US Shareholder Calculation of GILTI

Required for any US Shareholder with a positive GILTI inclusion. Aggregates the tested income, tested loss, and QBAI data from the underlying Forms 5471 (Schedule I-1) and computes the GILTI inclusion.

- **Form 8992 Schedule A** — by-CFC data
- **Form 8992 Schedule B** — calculation of net CFC tested income and inclusion

For US Shareholders that are members of a US consolidated group, **Form 8992** computes group-level GILTI; the regulations under Treas. Reg. §1.1502-51 allocate GILTI inclusions among the consolidated group members.

### 9.3 Form 8993 — Section 250 Deduction (FDII + GILTI)

The form on which a domestic C-corporation computes its §250 deduction:

- Part I — Determining DEI and DII
- Part II — Foreign-Derived Ratio (FDDEI / DEI)
- Part III — Section 250 deduction (50% × GILTI + §78 gross-up portion) + (37.5% × FDII)
- Part IV — Taxable income limitation under §250(a)(2)

Critical reconciliation: the §250 deduction reported on Form 1120, line 29b should tie to Form 8993, Part III line.

### 9.4 Form 8991 — Tax on Base Erosion Payments

For BEAT. Required when the applicable-taxpayer gross-receipts test is met, regardless of whether BEAT liability actually arises (to document non-application).

- Schedule A — Base erosion payments and tax benefits
- Schedule B — Modified taxable income
- Schedule C — Base erosion minimum tax amount (BEAT tax)

### 9.5 Related forms (refer-outs)

| Form | Purpose | Status here |
|---|---|---|
| **Form 8865** | US person interest in foreign partnership | Refer out — separate skill needed |
| **Form 8858** | US person owner of foreign disregarded entity or foreign branch | Refer out |
| **Form 8975 + Schedule A** | Country-by-Country (CbC) reporting for groups ≥$850M consolidated revenue | Refer out — Pillar Two-related but distinct |
| **Form 5472** | 25%+ foreign-owned US corp / foreign corp engaged in US trade or business | Inbound — separate analysis |
| **Form 1118** | FTC for corporations (general; required for any FTC claim including GILTI basket) | Coordination needed; this skill mentions GILTI basket but doesn't fully cover §904 |
| **Form 1116** | FTC for individuals (relevant for §962 electors and individual Subpart F inclusions) | Coordination needed |
| **Form 965 / 965-A / 965-B** | §965 transition tax tracking | Covered at §7 above; final installments through 2025 |
| **Form 8938** | Foreign financial asset reporting | FATCA — separate from Title 26 reporting |
| **FBAR (FinCEN 114)** | Foreign bank account reporting | Title 31, not Title 26 — separate filing |

## 10. Worked Examples

> All examples assume calendar-year filers, tax year **2025** (returns due in 2026), no extensions, no Pillar Two complications at the US level. Foreign tax rates and basis figures are illustrative.

### Example 1 — Small US C-corp with German subsidiary (GILTI inclusion)

**Facts.**

- TechCo, Inc. is a Delaware C-corporation, calendar year, owns 100% of TechCo GmbH (Germany), a CFC.
- TechCo GmbH 2025 results:
  - Gross income (active services to unrelated EU customers): €5,000,000
  - Operating deductions (salaries, rent, depreciation): €3,800,000
  - Net pretax income: €1,200,000
  - German corporate income tax + Gewerbesteuer combined effective rate: 30%
  - German tax: €360,000 → after-tax income €840,000
  - Average adjusted basis (ADS) of tangible business property (laptops, office equipment, leasehold improvements): €600,000
  - No Subpart F items; no ECI; no §954(b)(4) high-tax election in 2025.
- Assume €1 = $1.10 for simplicity. Translate at year-average exchange rate (Treas. Reg. §1.985-3 / §989).
- TechCo Inc. has no other CFCs and no specified interest expense apportioned to GILTI basket.

**Step 1: Translate to USD.**
- Tested income (after deductions, before German tax): €1,200,000 × 1.10 = **$1,320,000**
- German tax: €360,000 × 1.10 = **$396,000**
- QBAI: €600,000 × 1.10 = **$660,000**

**Step 2: Tested income.**

Under §951A(c), tested income is gross tested income less allocable deductions, but **foreign income tax is not deducted** in computing tested income (it is layered in via the §78 gross-up at the US Shareholder level).

> Tested Income = $1,320,000

**Step 3: QBAI and Net Deemed Tangible Income Return.**

> NDTIR = 10% × $660,000 = **$66,000**  
> (No interest-expense allocation in this simple fact pattern.)

**Step 4: GILTI inclusion.**

> Net CFC Tested Income = $1,320,000  
> GILTI (pre-§78) = $1,320,000 − $66,000 = **$1,254,000**

**Step 5: §78 gross-up.**

> Inclusion Percentage = $1,254,000 / $1,320,000 = **95.0%**  
> Tested Foreign Income Tax = $396,000  
> Deemed-paid tax = 95.0% × $396,000 = **$376,200**  
> Creditable amount (80% haircut) = 80% × $376,200 = **$300,960**  
> §78 gross-up adds the **deemed-paid tax** ($376,200) to the GILTI inclusion.

> **GILTI included in TechCo Inc. taxable income** = $1,254,000 + $376,200 = **$1,630,200**

**Step 6: §250 deduction.**

> §250 GILTI deduction = 50% × $1,630,200 = **$815,100**

(Subject to §250(a)(2) taxable income limitation, which we assume does not bite — TechCo has ample other US income.)

**Step 7: US tax on GILTI before FTC.**

> Tax base attributable to GILTI = $1,630,200 − $815,100 = $815,100  
> Tax at 21% = **$171,171**

**Step 8: GILTI basket FTC.**

> §904 limitation on GILTI basket = (Foreign-source taxable income in GILTI basket / Worldwide taxable income) × US tax  
> In a simple model where all of GILTI is foreign-source and no expenses are apportioned to GILTI basket:  
> §904 limitation ≈ $171,171  
> Deemed-paid tax creditable = $300,960  
> **FTC allowed = min($300,960, $171,171) = $171,171.** Excess of $300,960 − $171,171 = **$129,789 is LOST** (no carryforward).

**Step 9: Net US tax on GILTI.**

> Net US tax = $171,171 − $171,171 = **$0**

**Conclusion.** Because the German effective rate (30%) is well above the 13.125% break-even, the §960(d) deemed-paid credit fully covers US residual GILTI tax in this simple fact pattern. The $129,789 of excess credit is permanently lost.

**What goes on the forms:**
- **Form 5471** (Category 4 + 5), with Schedule I-1 reporting Tested Income $1,320,000, QBAI $660,000, Tested Foreign Income Tax $396,000.
- **Form 8992** with the GILTI inclusion of $1,254,000 (before §78 gross-up).
- **Form 1118** with GILTI-basket FTC of $171,171.
- **Form 8993** with §250 GILTI deduction of $815,100.
- **Form 1120** Schedule C / Schedule J pulling the §78 gross-up onto Line 5 and the §250 deduction on Line 29b.

> **Reviewer flag:** Confirm no §954(b)(4) high-tax election would be more favorable. At 30% effective rate, the election excludes the income from GILTI entirely. With the election: $0 GILTI, $0 §250 deduction, $0 FTC needed — same $0 US tax but no permanent loss of $129,789 of excess FTC. **Election is materially better in this case.** Reviewer should run both scenarios.

### Example 2 — US Individual with Singapore CFC, §962 election analysis

**Facts.**

- Sarah is a US citizen residing in San Francisco. She owns 100% of Sarah Trading Pte. Ltd. (Singapore), formed in 2022 to provide consulting services to Asia-Pacific clients.
- 2025 results of Sarah Trading Pte. Ltd.:
  - Gross income: SGD 800,000
  - Operating deductions (Sarah's salary as employee/director, office, travel, software): SGD 500,000
  - Net pretax income: SGD 300,000
  - Singapore CIT: 17% effective rate (partial-exemption regime, ignoring incentives) = SGD 51,000
  - After-tax income: SGD 249,000
  - QBAI (laptops, furniture, ADS basis): SGD 40,000
- Sarah pays herself a SGD 120,000 salary that the CFC deducts. (Wage income — handled on Sarah's individual return separately; not relevant to the GILTI computation here, already deducted at the CFC.)
- No actual dividend distributions in 2025.
- USD/SGD year-average: 1.35 SGD = $1 USD (i.e., $1 SGD = $0.74).
- Sarah's other 2025 US taxable income (wage + Subpart F-free) keeps her in the 37% top bracket plus 3.8% NIIT.

**Step 1: Translate.**

- Tested income USD: SGD 300,000 ÷ 1.35 = **$222,222**
- Singapore tax USD: SGD 51,000 ÷ 1.35 = **$37,778**
- QBAI USD: SGD 40,000 ÷ 1.35 = **$29,630**

**Step 2: GILTI inclusion (mechanically same for individual as for corp).**

- NDTIR = 10% × $29,630 = **$2,963**
- GILTI = $222,222 − $2,963 = **$219,259**

**Step 3 — Scenario A: NO §962 election.**

- Sarah includes $219,259 as ordinary income on Schedule 1.
- No §250 deduction (individual).
- No §960(d) deemed-paid FTC (individual).
- Sarah's marginal rate: 37% federal + 3.8% NIIT = 40.8%.
- Federal tax on GILTI: $219,259 × 40.8% = **$89,458**.
- California state tax: California does not conform to GILTI deduction; CA taxes the inclusion at up to 13.3% — additional **~$29,159**. (State out of scope here but flagging.)
- Singapore corporate tax already paid: $37,778 — **no US credit available** (individual can't claim §960(d)).

> **Scenario A total US federal tax on GILTI = $89,458.** Plus the $37,778 Singapore tax already paid sits on top — total economic tax burden = **$127,236** on $222,222 of CFC pretax income = **57.3% effective rate.** Brutal.

**Step 4 — Scenario B: §962 election.**

Under §962, Sarah is taxed on the GILTI inclusion as if she were a domestic C-corp.

- §78 gross-up: Inclusion percentage = $219,259 / $222,222 = 98.67%.  
  Deemed-paid tax = 98.67% × $37,778 = **$37,275**. Creditable at 80% = **$29,820**.
- Grossed-up GILTI inclusion = $219,259 + $37,275 = **$256,534**.
- §250 deduction = 50% × $256,534 = **$128,267**.
- Tax base = $256,534 − $128,267 = **$128,267**.
- US tax at 21% (§962 corporate rate) = **$26,936**.
- GILTI-basket FTC available = $29,820.
- §904 limitation on GILTI basket ≈ $26,936 (with no expense apportionment).
- FTC allowed = min($29,820, $26,936) = **$26,936**. Excess $2,884 LOST.
- **Net US federal tax on GILTI inclusion under §962 = $0.**
- NIIT does **NOT** apply to §962 income (because it is treated as corporate-rate income, not individual investment income — but this point is contested in some recent IRS positions; see CCA 202118008 — flag).

> **Scenario B current-year US federal tax = $0.**

**Step 5 — Future distribution analysis (the §962 catch).**

Sarah's deferred PTEP from the 2025 §962 inclusion = ~$256,534 of E&P that was previously taxed under §962 (in Sarah's hands), but the underlying CFC paid the actual Singapore tax of $37,778.

When Sarah eventually causes the CFC to distribute, the cash flowing from the underlying E&P:

- Under §959, distributions of PTEP are not re-taxed at the **CFC-attribute** level.
- But under §962(d) and Treas. Reg. §1.962-3, the distribution to the **individual electing shareholder** is taxable **as a dividend** to the extent it exceeds the §962 tax actually paid.
- The §962 tax paid = $0 in this example (because FTC zeroed it out).
- Therefore essentially the **entire future distribution is a dividend to Sarah**.
- If Singapore is a qualifying treaty country and the dividend is a "qualified dividend" under §1(h)(11), it would be taxed at LTCG rates: 20% + 3.8% NIIT = 23.8%.

So the eventual stack:
- $26,936 of US tax avoided in 2025 (good)
- But $256,534 of future dividend at ~23.8% = ~$61,055 of future US tax on distribution (vs. zero in Scenario A which already paid the 40.8% tax)
- And foreign withholding may apply to Singapore→US dividend (Singapore generally has no dividend WHT under domestic law).

**Comparing Scenarios A and B over time** (assuming all earnings ultimately distributed):

| | Scenario A (no §962) | Scenario B (§962) |
|---|---|---|
| Current US tax 2025 | $89,458 | $0 |
| Future US tax on $256,534 distribution | $0 (PTEP) | ~$61,055 (qualified div) |
| **Total US federal tax** | **$89,458** | **~$61,055** |

**§962 is clearly preferable here** — savings of approximately $28,403 (plus NIIT-on-distribution complications).

**What goes on the forms:**
- **Form 5471** (Cat. 5), Schedule I-1 with tested income, QBAI.
- **Form 8992** with Sarah's GILTI inclusion of $219,259.
- **§962 election statement** attached to Form 1040, citing Treas. Reg. §1.962-2(b), specifying the inclusion year, CFCs covered, and identifying information.
- **Form 8993** for the §250 GILTI deduction (yes — an individual making a §962 election uses Form 8993 to claim the corporate deduction).
- **Form 1116** for the GILTI-basket FTC at the individual level (§962 election permits the deemed-paid credit, but it's still reported on 1116 for individuals).
- Maintain **PTEP tracking schedule** for Sarah's §962 account.

> **Reviewer flags:**
> 1. Confirm the §962 election is timely (must be on a timely-filed return with extensions).
> 2. Confirm the basis-and-PTEP tracking. §962 PTEP accounts are notoriously poorly maintained and the consequences (in years 3, 5, 10 when distribution occurs) are severe.
> 3. State conformity: California has historically taxed GILTI inclusions at the individual level **without** the §250 deduction (CA non-conformity). The federal §962 election does **not** automatically flow into California — separate analysis needed. Consult `ca-540-individual-return`.
> 4. Watch the Singapore Pillar Two QDMTT situation — Singapore enacted a 15% QDMTT effective Jan 1, 2025 for groups within Pillar Two scope. Sarah's solo-shareholder CFC is well below €750M and not within Pillar Two, so this doesn't bite here, but is worth flagging for larger fact patterns.

### Example 3 — Large MNE BEAT computation

**Facts.**

- MegaCorp, Inc. is a publicly traded US C-corp with 2022–2024 average annual gross receipts of **$2.4 billion**. (Meets $500M gateway.)
- 2025 tax year results (US-only, simplified):
  - Gross receipts: $2,500M
  - COGS: $1,200M
  - Total deductions other than COGS: $1,000M, of which:
    - Salaries/G&A (US payees): $400M
    - Interest expense (third-party banks, US): $50M
    - Royalty paid to Foreign IP Co. (Bermuda, 100% related party — foreign related party): **$150M** [base erosion payment]
    - Management services fee paid to Foreign HQ Co. (Switzerland, related party), no SCM exception (priced cost-plus 8%): **$80M** [base erosion payment; the markup portion (~$5.9M) is the base eroding tax benefit only if SCM applied to cost portion — without SCM, the entire $80M is a base erosion payment]
    - Other US-domestic deductions: $320M
    - Depreciation on building acquired from foreign related party in 2023 (cost basis $200M, 39-year recovery): $5.1M annually [base erosion tax benefit — flowing from a base erosion payment as property acquisition]
- Regular taxable income: $2,500M − $1,200M COGS − $1,000M deductions = **$300M**
- Regular tax at 21% = **$63M** (before credits)
- R&D credit (§41): $20M
- Other GBC credits (§38 / §48 ITC / §45 PTC): $15M
- Net regular tax liability after credits: $63M − $20M − $15M = **$28M**

**Step 1: Applicable taxpayer test.**

- Average gross receipts: $2,400M ≥ $500M ✓
- Base erosion percentage:

```
Base Erosion Tax Benefits this year:
  - Royalty paid to Bermuda IP Co.: $150M
  - Services fee to Swiss HQ Co.: $80M
  - Depreciation on related-party-acquired building: $5.1M
  Total: $235.1M

Total deductions allowed:
  $1,000M total deductions (above) excluding COGS
  (Note: COGS is NOT a deduction so neither numerator nor denominator)

Base Erosion Percentage = $235.1M / $1,000M = 23.51%
```

23.51% ≥ 3% threshold ✓ — **MegaCorp is an applicable taxpayer**.

**Step 2: Modified Taxable Income (MTI).**

```
Regular Taxable Income:          $300.0M
+ Base Erosion Tax Benefits:     $235.1M
+ Base Erosion % × NOL deduction: $0  (no NOL used)
                                ─────────
Modified Taxable Income:         $535.1M
```

**Step 3: BEAT Minimum Tax Amount.**

2025 BEAT rate = **10%**.

```
10% × MTI                          = 10% × $535.1M  = $53.51M
Regular tax liability for BEAT comparison:
  Regular tax before credits        = $63.00M
  Less: R&D credit (fully usable
        for BEAT comparison
        pre-2026)                   = ($20.00M)
  Less: 80% of other GBC credits    = (80% × $15M)
                                      = ($12.00M)
  "Regular tax" for BEAT            = $31.00M

BEAT Minimum Tax Amount = max(0, $53.51M − $31.00M) = $22.51M
```

**Step 4: Total federal tax.**

```
Regular tax after credits:         $28.00M
BEAT add-on:                       $22.51M
                                  ─────────
Total federal tax:                 $50.51M
```

**Step 5: 2026 projection (illustrative).**

If MegaCorp's 2026 facts are similar but:
- BEAT rate increases to 12.5%
- R&D credit is added back to the BEAT regular-tax comparison
- 100% of other GBC credits are added back

```
10% × MTI scenario (2026 rate)     = 12.5% × $535.1M = $66.89M
"Regular tax" for BEAT (2026):
  Regular tax before credits        = $63.00M
  (No R&D credit usability)        = $0M offset
  (No GBC credit usability)        = $0M offset
  "Regular tax" for BEAT            = $63.00M

BEAT Minimum Tax Amount = max(0, $66.89M − $63.00M) = $3.89M
Plus regular tax after credits:    $28.00M
Total federal tax:                 $31.89M
```

> Counterintuitively, the 2026 BEAT add-on **decreases** in this fact pattern despite the higher rate, because the credit add-back raises the regular-tax floor. The 2026 result is sensitive: **a different MTI/credit mix could produce the opposite outcome.** Always re-run the BEAT model for each year.

**What goes on the forms:**
- **Form 8991**, with Schedule A listing each base erosion payment by counterparty + payment type, Schedule B for MTI, Schedule C for the BEAT computation.
- **Form 1120** with the BEAT add-on on Schedule J, Part I.

> **Reviewer flags:**
> 1. Confirm Services Cost Method analysis: is any of the $80M Swiss management fee at-cost (no markup) and eligible for SCM exclusion? If so, the cost portion is excluded; only the markup is a BEAT payment. Materially changes the result.
> 2. Confirm no §59A(h) qualified derivative payments are misclassified.
> 3. Confirm Bermuda IP Co. royalty is not subject to full US gross-basis withholding — Bermuda has no income tax treaty with the US, so the royalty is subject to 30% statutory WHT under §1442 unless reduced. Withholding paid by the payor may exclude the payment from BEAT (§59A(c)(2)(A)(ii)) — but only to the extent withholding tax was actually paid. Verify Form 1042 withholding.
> 4. Confirm constructive ownership / aggregation under §59A(e)(3) — MegaCorp may need to aggregate with US sister entities.
> 5. Coordinate Pillar Two analysis: if MegaCorp's consolidated revenue is ≥ €750M (it is — $2.5B converts to >€2.3B), MegaCorp is within Pillar Two scope worldwide. Foreign jurisdictions where MegaCorp operates may impose QDMTT/IIR/UTPR on the group. **The Swiss HQ Co. or Bermuda IP Co. low effective rates could trigger UTPR top-up tax in third-country jurisdictions starting 2025.** Refer to Pillar Two specialist.

## 11. Process Notes for Reviewer

### 11.1 Order of operations for a return with all three regimes

1. Determine CFC status of each foreign corp (§957 vote/value test, §958 attribution including post-§958(b)(4)-repeal downward attribution).
2. Identify US Shareholders (§951(b) 10% vote OR 10% value).
3. For each CFC and US Shareholder, compute Subpart F first (§951(a) categories).
4. Compute tested income / tested loss / QBAI per CFC (§951A(c)(2), §951A(d), via Form 5471 Schedule I-1).
5. Consider §954(b)(4) high-tax election (per "tested unit"). Run with-and-without scenarios for material CFCs.
6. Aggregate to US Shareholder GILTI inclusion (Form 8992).
7. Compute deemed-paid taxes and the GILTI-basket §904 limitation (Form 1118 / 1116).
8. For C-corps: compute FDII (Form 8993). Run together with GILTI for §250(a)(2) limitation.
9. For C-corps with >$500M gross receipts: run BEAT applicable-taxpayer test, then BEAT computation if applicable (Form 8991).
10. For individuals: evaluate §962 election with side-by-side scenario comparison.
11. Track PTEP balances (Schedules J and P of Form 5471, plus §962 PTEP separately).
12. Track §965 installment status if still in 8-year stream (final installment typically 2025).
13. Pillar Two: flag exposure for groups ≥€750M consolidated revenue. Coordinate with international finance team and ASC 740 provision.
14. State conformity overlay (refer to state-specific skill).
15. Reviewer signoff under Circular 230.

### 11.2 Defaults under uncertainty

Per `us-tax-workflow-base` conservative defaults principle:

- When CFC status is unclear, **assume CFC** and require explicit ownership documentation to rebut.
- When §954(b)(4) high-tax election would be material, **run both scenarios** and present to client.
- When §962 election would be material, **default to running the side-by-side**.
- When base erosion payment characterization is unclear, **default to including as BEAT payment** and require taxpayer documentation to support exclusion.
- When foreign use documentation for FDII is missing or inadequate, **default to excluding from FDDEI**.
- When in doubt about whether a foreign affiliate is a CFC due to §958(b)(4) downward attribution, **default to filing Form 5471** (penalty for unnecessary filing is $0; penalty for missed required filing is $10,000+ per form).

### 11.3 Common errors observed in practice

| Error | Consequence | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Computing QBAI under MACRS instead of ADS | Overstates QBAI, understates GILTI — IRS exam adjustment | Recompute under ADS straight-line over class life |
| Treating §250 deduction as available to individuals without §962 election | Wrong return; client owes back-tax + penalties | Verify §962 statement was filed |
| Forgetting the 20% FTC haircut on GILTI deemed-paid credit | Overstates FTC, understates US tax | Apply 80% factor |
| Carrying forward GILTI-basket excess FTC | Wrong — no carryforward allowed | Recognize permanent loss |
| Claiming FDII without §1.250(b)-3 documentation | FDII disallowed on audit | Build documentation file before filing |
| Missing a §958(b)(4)-downward-attribution CFC | $10K-50K penalty per missed Form 5471 | Run downward-attribution check for every US sub of a foreign-parented group |
| Treating COGS as a base erosion payment | Overstates BEAT | COGS is not a deduction; exclude from numerator and denominator |
| Treating R&D credit as fully usable for BEAT in 2026 | May overstate or understate BEAT | Watch the 2026 sunset — verify OBBBA changes |
| Forgetting §250(a)(2) taxable income limit | Overstates §250 deduction | Compute taxable income before §250 first |
| Confusing §951 (Subpart F) and §951A (GILTI) inclusions | Wrong character; wrong FTC basket | Subpart F = general/passive basket; GILTI = own basket |
