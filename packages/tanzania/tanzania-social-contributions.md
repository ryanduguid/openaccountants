**Contribution overview (private-sector Mainland employee)**

| Item | Employer | Employee | Total | Base | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE | — | 0%–30% progressive | — | Monthly income after pension | TRA |
| NSSF pension | 10% | 10% | 20% | Gross wage | NSSF |

| WCF | 0.5%–0.6% | — | 0.5%–0.6% | Cash paid to employees | PwC / WCF [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm tariff] |

**Conservative defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | Assume resident (progressive PAYE); ask before applying 15% flat |
| Unknown sector (private vs public) | Assume private → NSSF (10%/10%); confirm before PSSSF |
| Unknown employee headcount for SDL | If unknown, flag — SDL only applies at ≥10 employees (TRA) |
| Unknown WCF tariff | Use 0.6% private / 0.5% public and FLAG [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Unknown whether pension already deducted before PAYE | Deduct mandatory pension before computing PAYE base (TRA) |
| Zanzibar vs Mainland not stated | Assume Mainland; STOP on levies if Zanzibar (different regime) |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly wage (TZS), residency status (resident / non-resident), and sector (private vs public). Without gross wage, STOP.

**Recommended** — employer headcount (for SDL liability), whether employee is on a permitted alternative NSSF split (15%/5%), and Mainland vs Zanzibar location.

**Ideal** — TRA PAYE return (ITX 300.01.E credit slip), NSSF Form NSSF/CON.5 earnings statement, payroll register, and bank statements showing TRA / NSSF / WCF remittances.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-TZ-SC-1 — Gross wage unknown** — Trigger: monthly gross wage not provided. Message: "Monthly gross wage in TZS is mandatory for PAYE and pension computation. PAYE is progressive and pension is a percentage of gross. Cannot proceed without this figure."
- **R-TZ-SC-2 — Zanzibar payroll levies** — Trigger: employment located in Zanzibar. Message: "PAYE brackets are identical in Zanzibar per TRA, but SDL and certain social levies operate under a separate Zanzibar regime. Do not apply Mainland SDL/levy figures to Zanzibar without confirming the Zanzibar schedule. Escalate to a practitioner."
- **R-TZ-SC-3 — WCF tariff confirmation** — Trigger: a definitive WCF figure is required for filing. Message: "The current private-sector WCF tariff is unconfirmed from WCF's own publications (PwC states 0.5%; other sources state 0.6%). Do not present a definitive WCF charge without confirming the tariff directly with WCF."
- **R-TZ-SC-4 — Arrears / penalty quantification** — Trigger: client has unpaid PAYE, NSSF, SDL, or WCF from prior periods. Message: "Statutory penalties (TRA 2.5%/month, NSSF 5%/month) compound on unpaid amounts. Do not attempt to quantify arrears without official statements. Escalate to a practitioner."
- **R-TZ-SC-5 — Presumptive tax / non-PAYE individuals** — Trigger: individual under the presumptive regime (turnover ≤ TZS 100 million). Message: "The presumptive income tax regime is outside the scope of this payroll skill and its rate bands are not captured here. Escalate to a practitioner. [RESEARCH GAP — presumptive bands not extracted]"

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Tanzanian payroll taxes and social security. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Statutory remittances (PAYE, NSSF, PSSSF, SDL, WCF) are EXCLUDED from any VAT return — they are statutory obligations, not business supplies. The employer share of pension/SDL/WCF is a deductible business cost; the employee share is withheld from wages, not an employer expense.

### 3.1 TRA payments (PAYE / SDL)

**TRA payments (PAYE / SDL)**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRA, TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY | EXCLUDE — statutory tax remittance | PAYE and/or SDL monthly remittance |
| PAYE, P.A.Y.E | EXCLUDE — employee tax withheld | Remitted by 7th of following month |
| SDL, SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LEVY | EXCLUDE — employer levy | 3.5%; employer ≥10 staff |
| ITX 300, ITX300.01.E | EXCLUDE — employment taxes credit slip | TRA payment reference |

### 3.2 Pension fund debits (NSSF / PSSSF)

**Pension fund debits (NSSF / PSSSF)**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NSSF, NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND | EXCLUDE — pension contribution | 20% total (10% er / 10% ee) |
| NSSF/CON.5, CON.5 | EXCLUDE — NSSF contribution statement | Form filed with payment |
| PSSSF, PUBLIC SERVICE SOCIAL SECURITY | EXCLUDE — public-sector pension | 20% total (15% er / 5% ee) |
| MICHANGO YA PENSHENI | EXCLUDE — pension contribution | Swahili: "pension contributions" |

### 3.3 Workers Compensation Fund (WCF)

**Workers Compensation Fund (WCF)**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WCF, WORKERS COMPENSATION FUND | EXCLUDE — employer levy | 0.5%–0.6%, employer-only |
| MFUKO WA FIDIA KWA WAFANYAKAZI | EXCLUDE — WCF | Swahili: "workers compensation fund" |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contributions classification)

**Salary and payroll (exclude from contributions classification)**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SALARY, MSHAHARA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | Gross wage paid; not a contribution |
| SALARY, MSHAHARA (incoming) | EXCLUDE — employment income received | Not a contribution |
| WAGES, MISHAHARA | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | Plural Swahili "salaries" |

### 3.5 Pension / benefit payments received (NOT contributions)

**Pension / benefit payments received (NOT contributions)**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NSSF PENSION, PSSSF PENSION (credit) | EXCLUDE — pension benefit received | Inbound, not a contribution paid |
| PENSHENI (credit) | EXCLUDE — pension income | Swahili: "pension" received |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement / payroll classifications for a hypothetical private-sector employer and employee in Tanzania Mainland. All amounts in TZS. PAYE is computed on income **after** deducting the mandatory NSSF employee contribution (TRA).

### Example 1 — Mid-bracket employee PAYE + NSSF

**Input:** Resident employee, gross monthly wage TZS 800,000, private sector, employer has 25 staff.

**Reasoning:**
- NSSF employee 10% = 80,000. NSSF employer 10% = 80,000. NSSF total 20% = 160,000.
- PAYE base = 800,000 − 80,000 = 720,000.
- PAYE: falls in band 520,001–760,000 → 20,000 + 20% × (720,000 − 520,000) = 20,000 + 20% × 200,000 = 20,000 + 40,000 = **60,000**.
- Net pay = 800,000 − 80,000 (NSSF ee) − 60,000 (PAYE) = **660,000**.
- Employer also bears: NSSF 80,000 + SDL 3.5% × 800,000 = 28,000 + WCF 0.6% × 800,000 = 4,800.

**Classification:** PAYE 60,000 and NSSF ee 80,000 withheld; NSSF er 80,000, SDL 28,000, WCF 4,800 employer-borne. All statutory remittances EXCLUDE from VAT.

### Example 2 — Top-bracket employee PAYE

**Input:** Resident employee, gross monthly wage TZS 1,500,000, private sector.

**Reasoning:**
- NSSF employee 10% = 150,000. PAYE base = 1,500,000 − 150,000 = 1,350,000.
- PAYE: above 1,000,000 → 128,000 + 30% × (1,350,000 − 1,000,000) = 128,000 + 30% × 350,000 = 128,000 + 105,000 = **233,000**.
- Net pay = 1,500,000 − 150,000 − 233,000 = **1,117,000**.

**Classification:** PAYE 233,000 + NSSF ee 150,000 withheld. EXCLUDE remittances from VAT.

### Example 3 — Low earner below tax-free threshold

**Input:** Resident employee, gross monthly wage TZS 290,000, private sector.

**Reasoning:**
- NSSF employee 10% = 29,000. PAYE base = 290,000 − 29,000 = 261,000.
- PAYE base 261,000 ≤ 270,000 tax-free threshold → PAYE = **Nil** (TRA).
- Net pay = 290,000 − 29,000 = **261,000**.
- Note: 290,000 gross is below the new general minimum-wage baseline of TZS 358,322/month effective 1 Jan 2026 (GN 605A/2025) — flag wage compliance.

**Classification:** PAYE Nil; NSSF ee 29,000 withheld. Flag minimum-wage compliance.

### Example 4 — Non-resident employee (flat 15%)

**Input:** Non-resident employee, gross monthly employment income TZS 4,000,000.

**Reasoning:**
- Non-resident employment income is taxed at a **flat 15% final tax** (PwC) — progressive brackets do NOT apply.
- PAYE = 15% × 4,000,000 = **600,000**.
- Pension: NSSF applicability to non-residents is case-specific; flag for reviewer.

**Classification:** PAYE 600,000 (final tax). EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag NSSF applicability.

### Example 5 — TRA bank debit (combined PAYE + SDL)

**Input line:**
`07.02.2026 ; TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY ; DEBIT ; ITX 300.01.E JAN PAYE+SDL ; -1,250,000 ; TZS`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY" / "ITX 300.01.E" (patterns 3.1). This is the monthly employment-taxes remittance (PAYE withheld + SDL) due by the 7th of the following month (TRA). EXCLUDE from VAT. The PAYE component is withheld employee tax (not an employer cost); the SDL component (3.5%) is a deductible employer levy.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Statutory PAYE+SDL remittance.

### Example 6 — Ambiguous NSSF debit (possible arrears/penalty)

**Input line:**
`20.03.2026 ; NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND ; DEBIT ; ARREARS ; -3,500,000 ; TZS`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND" (pattern 3.2) but amount is irregular and reference says "ARREARS." NSSF late penalty is 5% of the unpaid amount per month or part-month (NSSF Act, Cap. 50). Cannot separate principal from penalty without an NSSF statement / Form NSSF/CON.5. EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag for reviewer.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag for reviewer — request NSSF breakdown to split contribution principal from 5%/month penalty.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payroll data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 — PAYE is computed on income AFTER mandatory pension

- **PAYE base formula** — PAYE base = gross monthly income − mandatory NSSF/PSSSF employee contribution. Pension contributions are deductible before applying the PAYE schedule.  _(TRA)_

### Rule 2 — Resident PAYE progressive schedule (monthly, TZS)

**Resident PAYE progressive schedule**  _(TRA (Income Tax for Individuals); PwC (last reviewed 14 Jan 2026))_

| Monthly PAYE base (TZS) | Tax |
| --- | --- |
| 0 – 270,000 | Nil |
| 270,001 – 520,000 | 8% of excess over 270,000 |
| 520,001 – 760,000 | 20,000 + 20% of excess over 520,000 |
| 760,001 – 1,000,000 | 68,000 + 25% of excess over 760,000 |
| Above 1,000,000 | 128,000 + 30% of excess over 1,000,000 |

- **Cumulative figures verification and lowest band note** — Cumulative figures verified: at 520,000 → 20,000; at 760,000 → 68,000; at 1,000,000 → 128,000. Lowest band is 8% (TRA/PwC) — do not use the outdated 9% from some secondary calculators.  _(TRA/PwC)_

### Rule 3 — Tax-free threshold

- **Tax-free threshold** — The first TZS 270,000/month is not taxed (TRA states annual income of TZS 3,240,000 is not taxable). 270,000 × 12 = 3,240,000 ✓.  _(TRA)_

### Rule 4 — Non-resident flat rate

- **Non-resident employment income rate** — Non-resident employment income is taxed at a flat 15% final tax. The progressive schedule does not apply.  _(PwC)_

### Rule 5 — NSSF (private sector) contribution

- **NSSF total contribution and split** — Total NSSF = 20% of gross monthly wage, joint employer/employee. Standard split: 10% employer / 10% employee (employee share capped at 10%). Permitted alternative: 15% employer / 5% employee; employer may remit the full 20% without deducting from the employee. The legal obligation to remit rests on the employer. No published floor or ceiling on the contribution base.  _(NSSF; PwC)_

### Rule 6 — PSSSF (public sector) contribution

- **PSSSF total contribution and split** — Total PSSSF = 20%, split 15% employer / 5% employee, under the Public Service Social Security Act, 2018. [RESEARCH GAP — split sourced from secondary material; reviewer to confirm against PSSSF official documentation.]  _(Public Service Social Security Act, 2018)_

### Rule 7 — Skills and Development Levy (SDL)

- **SDL rate and threshold** — SDL = 3.5% of total gross monthly emoluments paid to all employees, payable by employers with 10 or more employees (TRA — authoritative; ignore secondary "4 or more" sources). Form ITX 300.01.E. Employer-borne. Exemptions: government departments / wholly govt-financed institutions, certain interns, and farm employers whose employees are solely engaged in farming.  _(TRA)_

### Rule 8 — Workers Compensation Fund (WCF)

- **WCF rate and treatment** — WCF is employer-borne only (not deducted from employees), payable monthly on cash paid to employees. Rate: PwC (Jan 2026) states 0.5%; other sources state 0.6% private / 0.5% public (0.6% private effective July 2021). [RESEARCH GAP — exact current private-sector tariff unconfirmed from WCF's own publications; default to 0.6% private / 0.5% public and FLAG before filing.]  _(PwC / WCF)_

### Rule 9 — Monthly remittance deadlines

**Monthly remittance deadlines**

| Item | Deadline | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE + SDL (TRA) | 7th day of the month following the payroll month | TRA |
| WCF | Monthly (with cash paid) | PwC |
| NSSF | Within one month after the end of the month it relates to (NSSF Act s.14); practitioners cite end of following month | NSSF Act Cap. 50 |

### Rule 10 — Penalties

**Penalties**

| Item | Penalty | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE/SDL late (TRA) | Higher of 2.5% of unpaid tax per month (or part) or 15 currency points (body corporate); plus interest | TRA |
| NSSF late | 5% of unpaid amount per month or part-month | NSSF Act Cap. 50 |

### Rule 11 — Minimum wage (private sector, effective 1 Jan 2026)

- **Minimum wage** — New order Government Notice No. 605A (13 Oct 2025) raises the baseline by an average 33.4% to TZS 358,322/month (cross-sector average; rates are sector-specific). Sectors not specifically covered: TZS 175,000/month. Based on a 45-hour workweek.  _(TanzLII GN 605A/2025; PKF)_

### Rule 12 — Statutory remittances are not VATable supplies

- **VAT treatment of statutory remittances** — PAYE, NSSF, PSSSF, SDL, and WCF remittances are EXCLUDED from any VAT return. Employer shares of pension/SDL/WCF are deductible business costs; employee withholdings are not employer expenses.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When payroll data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these situations for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 — Residency status ambiguity

- **Residency status ambiguity** — Trigger: Unclear whether the employee is resident or non-resident for the tax year. Issue: Residents use the progressive 0%–30% schedule; non-residents pay a flat 15% final tax. Misclassification changes the entire computation. Action: Flag for reviewer. Confirm tax residency before computing PAYE.

### T2-2 — NSSF split election (15%/5% vs 10%/10%)

- **NSSF split election** — Trigger: Employer applies, or asks about, the alternative 15% employer / 5% employee split, or remits the full 20% with no employee deduction. Issue: Net pay and employer cost differ depending on which permitted split applies. The employee share must not exceed 10%. Action: Flag for reviewer. Confirm the agreed split before computing net pay.

### T2-3 — SDL headcount near the threshold

- **SDL headcount near threshold** — Trigger: Employer headcount is around 9–11, or fluctuates across months. Issue: SDL applies only at 10 or more employees (TRA). Crossing the threshold mid-year changes SDL liability. Action: Flag for reviewer. Confirm the monthly headcount basis.

### T2-4 — WCF tariff (0.5% vs 0.6%)

- **WCF tariff ambiguity** — Trigger: A definitive WCF charge is needed. Issue: PwC states 0.5%; other sources state 0.6% private / 0.5% public. The exact current private tariff is unconfirmed from WCF's own publications. Action: Flag for reviewer. Confirm the tariff directly with WCF before filing. [RESEARCH GAP]

### T2-5 — Public vs private sector / fund selection

- **Public vs private sector fund selection** — Trigger: Unclear whether the employer is in the public sector (PSSSF) or private/informal sector (NSSF). Issue: Fund and split differ — NSSF 10%/10% vs PSSSF 15%/5%. The PSSSF split itself is sourced from secondary material. Action: Flag for reviewer. Confirm sector and the applicable fund.

### T2-6 — Zanzibar employment

- **Zanzibar employment** — Trigger: Employment located in Zanzibar. Issue: PAYE brackets are identical, but SDL and certain social levies follow a separate Zanzibar regime. Action: Flag for reviewer. Do not apply Mainland levy figures to Zanzibar without the Zanzibar schedule.

### T2-7 — Arrears and penalties

- **Arrears and penalties** — Trigger: Unpaid PAYE, NSSF, SDL, or WCF from prior periods. Issue: TRA penalty 2.5%/month (or part) plus interest; NSSF penalty 5%/month (or part). These compound on unpaid amounts. Action: Do not quantify arrears without official statements. Escalate to a practitioner.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How payroll-tax debits appear on Tanzanian bank statements

**CRDB Bank:**
- Description: "TRA", "TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY", "PAYE", "SDL", "NSSF", "WCF"
- Timing: TRA (PAYE/SDL) around the 7th of the following month; NSSF by month-end following

**NMB Bank:**
- Description: "TRA PAYMENT", "ITX 300", "NSSF", "PSSSF", "WCF"
- Timing: Same monthly cycle

**NBC Bank:**
- Description: "TANZANIA REVENUE AUTHORITY", "NATIONAL SOCIAL SECURITY FUND", "WORKERS COMPENSATION FUND"
- Timing: Same monthly cycle

**Key identification tips:**
1. Statutory remittances are always outgoing (DEBIT), never credits.
2. TRA debits cover PAYE and/or SDL; pension debits go to NSSF or PSSSF; WCF is a separate small debit.
3. PAYE/SDL recur around the 7th of the following month; NSSF by the end of the following month.
4. Swahili terms: MSHAHARA = salary; MICHANGO YA PENSHENI = pension contributions; MFUKO WA FIDIA KWA WAFANYAKAZI = workers compensation fund; PENSHENI = pension.
5. Inbound credits labelled "NSSF PENSION" / "PENSHENI" are benefits received, not contributions paid.
6. Irregular lump sums with "ARREARS" may include penalties — flag and request a fund statement.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for statutory debits** — identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns (TRA, NSSF, PSSSF, SDL, WCF).
2. **Group by type** — separate TRA (PAYE/SDL) from pension (NSSF/PSSSF) and from WCF.
3. **Reverse-engineer the wage base where possible:**
   - NSSF total ÷ 20% ≈ gross wage (standard split). Employee 10% line ÷ 10% ≈ gross wage.
   - SDL ÷ 3.5% ≈ total gross emoluments for the payroll (only if employer has ≥10 staff).
4. **Confirm sector** — NSSF implies private/informal; PSSSF implies public.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank statement amounts only. Residency, sector, NSSF split, headcount, and the WCF tariff have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing."

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### PAYE worked figures (resident, 2026)

**PAYE worked figures (resident, 2026)**

| Gross wage (TZS) | NSSF ee (10%) | PAYE base | PAYE due | Net pay | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 290,000 | 29,000 | 261,000 | 0 | 261,000 | TRA |
| 800,000 | 80,000 | 720,000 | 60,000 | 660,000 | TRA |
| 1,500,000 | 150,000 | 1,350,000 | 233,000 | 1,117,000 | TRA |

(Arithmetic: 720,000 → 20,000 + 20%×200,000 = 60,000. 1,350,000 → 128,000 + 30%×350,000 = 233,000.)

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Resident, gross 800,000, private. → NSSF ee 80,000; PAYE base 720,000; PAYE 60,000; net 660,000.

**Test 2:** Resident, gross 1,500,000, private. → NSSF ee 150,000; PAYE base 1,350,000; PAYE 233,000; net 1,117,000.

**Test 3:** Resident, gross 290,000, private. → NSSF ee 29,000; PAYE base 261,000; PAYE Nil; net 261,000.

**Test 4:** Resident, gross 600,000, private. → NSSF ee 60,000; PAYE base 540,000; PAYE = 20,000 + 20%×(540,000−520,000) = 20,000 + 4,000 = 24,000; net = 600,000 − 60,000 − 24,000 = 516,000.

**Test 5:** Resident, gross 1,000,000, private. → NSSF ee 100,000; PAYE base 900,000; PAYE = 68,000 + 25%×(900,000−760,000) = 68,000 + 35,000 = 103,000; net = 1,000,000 − 100,000 − 103,000 = 797,000.

**Test 6:** Non-resident, gross 4,000,000. → PAYE = 15%×4,000,000 = 600,000 (final tax).

**Test 7:** Private employer, total payroll 50,000,000, 30 staff. → SDL = 3.5%×50,000,000 = 1,750,000 (employer-borne). WCF (0.6%) = 300,000 [confirm tariff].

**Test 8:** Public-sector employee, gross 1,200,000, PSSSF 15/5. → PSSSF ee 5% = 60,000; PSSSF er 15% = 180,000; total 20% = 240,000 [GAP — confirm PSSSF split].

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute PAYE without the monthly gross wage.
- NEVER apply progressive brackets to a non-resident — non-resident employment income is a flat 15% final tax.
- NEVER compute PAYE on gross — always deduct the mandatory employee pension contribution first (TRA).
- NEVER charge SDL to an employer with fewer than 10 employees (TRA).
- NEVER present a definitive WCF figure without confirming the current tariff with WCF [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER apply the PSSSF 15/5 split as definitive without confirming against PSSSF documentation [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER apply Mainland SDL/levy figures to Zanzibar without the Zanzibar schedule.
- NEVER deduct more than 10% from an employee for NSSF — the employee share is capped at 10%.
- NEVER quantify arrears or penalties without official TRA/NSSF statements — escalate to a practitioner.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — label as estimated and direct the client to their TRA/NSSF statements.
