## Section 3 -- Deductibility Under Income Tax Act

### Section 16(iii) -- Deduction from Salary Income

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Section | 16(iii) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 |
| Deduction basis | Allowed in the year of PAYMENT (not accrual) |
| Cap | No cap on deduction (but PT itself is capped at ₹2,500/year) |
| For self-employed | Deductible under Section 37(1) as business expenditure |
| ITR reporting | Shown as deduction from gross salary in Part B of Form 16 / ITR-1 |

### Impact on Tax Computation

| Step | Computation |
|---|---|
| Gross Salary | As per employer records |
| Less: Standard Deduction | ₹75,000 (FY 2025-26 under new regime; ₹50,000 under old regime) |
| Less: Professional Tax paid | Up to ₹2,500 (under old regime; included in standard deduction under new regime) |
| = Income from Salary | Taxable amount |

**New Tax Regime (Section 115BAC):** Under the new regime (default from FY 2023-24), the standard deduction of ₹75,000 covers both the standard deduction and profession tax deduction. Separate Section 16(iii) claim may not be additionally available under new regime.

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### 5.1 Multiple Employments
If an individual has multiple employers in the same state, each employer must deduct PT independently. The maximum combined deduction may exceed ₹2,500/year in practice -- the employee can claim refund of excess from the state authority.

### 5.2 Multi-State Employment
If an individual works in multiple states (e.g., transferred mid-year), PT is payable in each state for the period of employment in that state. Deduction under Section 16(iii) covers total PT paid across all states.

### 5.3 Directors
Company directors receiving sitting fees or remuneration are liable for PT in the state where the company is registered or where they attend meetings (varies by state).

### 5.4 Freelancers / Gig Workers
Self-employed professionals (doctors, lawyers, CAs, engineers, consultants) must self-enroll and pay PT in the state where they practice. Threshold varies by state.

### 5.5 Exemptions
Common exemptions across states:
- Parents/guardians of children with permanent disability (some states)
- Members of armed forces (some states)
- Persons above 65 years (some states, e.g., Maharashtra)
- Badli workers in textile industry (Maharashtra)
