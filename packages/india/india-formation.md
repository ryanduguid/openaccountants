## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-IN-F1 -- No Indian-resident director.** "At least one director must have been resident in India for at least 182 days in the preceding calendar year. A company cannot be incorporated without this. Foreign founders must appoint a qualifying resident director."

**R-IN-F2 -- Ignoring annual compliance.** "Indian companies face heavy penalties for non-filing: ₹100/day for late annual return, disqualification of directors after 3 years of non-filing (s164(2)), and potential strike-off by ROC."

**R-IN-F3 -- DIR-3 KYC missed.** "Every director must file DIR-3 KYC annually by 30 September. Missing this results in DIN deactivation (₹5,000 penalty to reactivate) and inability to file any MCA forms."

**R-IN-F4 -- Shell company formation.** "MCA actively identifies and strikes off shell companies under s248. This skill will not assist in forming a company with no genuine business activity. Dormant company status (s455) exists for genuine temporary inactivity."

**R-IN-F5 -- Authorised capital too low.** "Starting with ₹1 lakh authorised capital is common, but increasing it later costs ₹15,000+ in fees. If the business plan requires significant capitalisation, advise higher authorised capital upfront."
