## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Skill | Interaction |
|---|---|
| india-einvoice | No direct interaction (e-invoicing is GST/B2B; payroll is separate) |
| payroll-workflow-base | General payroll processing workflow; India-specific overrides in this skill |

### India-Specific Payroll Considerations

- **New Labour Codes**: The four codes (Wages, Social Security, Industrial Relations, OSH) became effective November 2025. Key impact: Basic + DA must be ≥ 50% of total remuneration, increasing PF/gratuity costs.
- **Dual tax regime**: Default is new regime (Section 115BAC). Employee must explicitly opt for old regime. Employer MUST compute TDS per new regime if no declaration received.
- **State variations**: Minimum wages, Professional Tax rates, Shops & Establishments Act rules, and LWF contributions all vary by state. ALWAYS identify the employee's state of employment.
- **PF wage ceiling**: Statutory ceiling is INR 15,000/month for mandatory PF. Many employers contribute on actual Basic (above ceiling) voluntarily or per company policy.
- **ESI expansion**: Under new Labour Codes, ESI coverage expanded to all geographic areas. Previously, only notified areas were covered.
- **Income Tax Act 2025**: Takes effect from 1 April 2026 (FY 2026-27). Form 24Q → Form 138; Form 16 → Form 130. Same slab rates expected; procedural/section number changes.
- **Arrears/bonus**: When arrears or bonuses are paid, TDS must be computed on total projected annual income including such payments. Relief under Section 89 may apply.
