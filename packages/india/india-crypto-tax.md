| Unknown FMV at receipt | Use exchange price at time of transaction |
| Gift of VDA — unknown value | Obtain FMV; if ≥ ₹50,000, taxable in hands of recipient |

---

## Section 2 — Classification Rules

### The 115BBH Regime — No Capital vs Income Distinction

Unlike most jurisdictions, India does **not** distinguish between capital gains and income for crypto taxation. Section 115BBH applies a **flat 30% tax** on any income arising from the **transfer** of a VDA, regardless of:

- Holding period (no short-term vs long-term distinction)
- Frequency of trading
- Whether taxpayer is an investor or trader
- Whether gain is revenue or capital in nature

| Classification Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Is crypto a capital asset in India? | The government treats income from VDA transfer under a special regime (S.115BBH) separate from the regular capital gains provisions |
| Does holding period matter? | NO — flat 30% regardless of holding period |
| Does trader vs investor distinction matter? | NO — flat 30% in either case |
| Can crypto be treated as business income? | Only mining/staking/providing services may be classified as business income or income from other sources; the transfer gain is always 30% under 115BBH |

### What constitutes a "transfer" under 115BBH

- Sale of VDA for fiat (INR or foreign currency)
- Exchange of one VDA for another VDA (crypto-to-crypto swap)
- Use of VDA as payment for goods or services
- Gift of VDA (except to specified relatives under Section 56)
- Any disposal or alienation of VDA

---

## Section 3 — Rate Table

### Tax on Transfer of VDA (Section 115BBH)

| Component | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base tax on VDA transfer income | 30% | S. 115BBH(1)(a) |
| Health & Education Cess | 4% on tax | S. 136C |
| Effective rate (before surcharge) | 31.20% | — |

### Surcharge (based on total income including VDA)

| Total Income | Surcharge Rate | Effective VDA Tax Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Up to ₹50 lakh | Nil | 31.20% |
| ₹50 lakh – ₹1 crore | 10% | 34.32% |
| ₹1 crore – ₹2 crore | 15% | 35.88% |
| ₹2 crore – ₹5 crore | 25% | 39.00% |
| Above ₹5 crore | 37% | 42.74% |

**Note:** Marginal relief applies at surcharge thresholds.

### TDS on Transfer of VDA (Section 194S)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Rate | 1% of consideration |
| Threshold (general) | ₹10,000 aggregate in a financial year |
| Threshold (specified persons) | ₹50,000 aggregate (individual/HUF with business turnover ≤ ₹1 crore or profession receipts ≤ ₹50 lakh in preceding year) |
| Who deducts | Buyer of VDA / exchange platform |
| When | At time of credit or payment, whichever is earlier |
| TDS on crypto-to-crypto | Both parties may be liable (buyer of each VDA in the swap) |
| Form | Form 26QE (now Form 141 under ITA 2025) |
| Deposit deadline | Within 30 days from end of month of deduction |

---

## Section 4 — Cost Basis

### Permitted Deductions

| Deductible | Permitted? | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Cost of acquisition | YES | Purchase price of the VDA only |
| Cost of improvement | NO | Explicitly disallowed under S.115BBH(2)(a) |
| Transfer expenses | NO | Exchange fees, gas fees — NOT deductible |
| Any other deduction | NO | No deduction under any section of the Act |
| Depreciation | NO | Not applicable |

**This is the harshest cost basis regime globally.** Only the original purchase price can be deducted — no fees, no commissions, no gas costs.

### Cost Basis Methods

India does not prescribe FIFO/LIFO/average cost for individuals. The Act simply refers to "cost of acquisition." In practice:

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| FIFO | Commonly used by exchanges and software |
| Average cost | Acceptable in practice |
| Specific identification | Acceptable if documented |
| LIFO | Not standard; no prohibition |

The key constraint is that **only cost of acquisition** matters — method of identifying which lot was sold is secondary.

### Zero-Cost Scenarios

| Scenario | Cost of Acquisition |
|---|---|
| Mined tokens | ₹0 (no cost of acquisition; full value is gain) |
| Staking rewards received | ₹0 (if not purchased) |
| Airdrop tokens | ₹0 |
| Hard fork tokens | ₹0 |
| Gifted VDA (below ₹50,000) | Cost to the previous owner (for computing S.115BBH gain on subsequent transfer) |

---

## Section 5 — DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrops

### 5.1 Mining

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Receipt of mined tokens | Taxable as "income from other sources" or "business income" at applicable slab rates |
| Cost basis of mined tokens | FMV at time of mining (if taxed as income on receipt) becomes the cost of acquisition for future transfer |
| Subsequent transfer | 30% flat tax under S.115BBH on (proceeds – cost of acquisition) |

**Note:** There is ambiguity on whether mining income is taxed at slab rates (as other income) AND THEN the transfer gain is separately taxed at 30%. Conservative approach: tax as income on receipt, then 30% on disposal gain from that FMV cost basis.

### 5.2 Staking

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Staking rewards received | Income from other sources at FMV on receipt — taxed at slab rates |
| Cost basis of staking rewards | FMV at receipt date |
| Subsequent transfer of staked tokens | 30% under S.115BBH |

### 5.3 Airdrops

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop requiring action | Income at FMV on receipt; slab rates |
| Unsolicited airdrop | Potentially taxable as income under Section 56(2)(x) if value > ₹50,000 |
| Transfer of airdropped tokens | 30% under S.115BBH; cost of acquisition = ₹0 or FMV if already taxed as income |

### 5.4 DeFi Lending/Yield

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Interest/yield from DeFi protocols | Income from other sources; taxed at slab rates |
| LP token receipt (deposit into pool) | May constitute transfer of VDA — 30% on any gain |
| LP token withdrawal | Transfer — 30% on gain |
| Impermanent loss | No explicit relief; loss on VDA transfer cannot offset anything |

### 5.5 Hard Forks

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| New tokens from hard fork | Cost of acquisition = ₹0 |
| Transfer of forked tokens | 30% on full proceeds (zero cost basis) |
| Original tokens | Cost basis unchanged |

---

## Section 6 — NFT Treatment

NFTs are explicitly included in the VDA definition under Section 2(47A)(b).

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Purchase of NFT | Acquisition — record cost |
| Sale of NFT | Transfer of VDA — 30% flat tax on gain under S.115BBH |
| Creation and sale (artist) | If business income: slab rates; if transfer of VDA: 30% |
| Royalty on secondary sale | Income from other sources; slab rates |
| NFT-for-NFT swap | Transfer of VDA on both sides — 30% on each gain |
| Gift of NFT (value > ₹50,000) | Taxable in hands of recipient under S.56(2)(x) |
| NFT becomes worthless | Loss — cannot be offset or carried forward |

---

## Section 7 — Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 ITR Forms

| Taxpayer Type | Applicable ITR | Schedule |
|---|---|---|
| Individual with salary + VDA income | ITR-2 | Schedule VDA |
| Individual/HUF with business income + VDA | ITR-3 | Schedule VDA |
| Company | ITR-6 | Schedule VDA |

### 7.2 Schedule VDA (Virtual Digital Asset)

Schedule VDA requires the following for each VDA transaction:

| Field | Detail |
|---|---|
| Type of VDA | Cryptocurrency, NFT, other |
| Date of transfer | DD/MM/YYYY |
| Date of acquisition | DD/MM/YYYY |
| Head of income | Income from transfer of VDA |
| Cost of acquisition | In INR |
| Consideration received | In INR |
| Income from transfer | Gain (consideration – cost) |

### 7.3 TDS Reporting

| Form | Purpose | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Form 26QE / Form 141 | TDS on VDA transfer | Within 30 days from end of month |
| Form 26AS / AIS | Annual Information Statement — reflects TDS deducted | Available on e-filing portal |
| Form 67 | For claiming foreign tax credit (if VDA traded on foreign exchange and tax paid abroad) | Before filing ITR |

### 7.4 Key Deadlines

| Deadline | Date (FY 2025-26 / AY 2026-27) |
|---|---|
| Advance tax — 1st instalment | 15 June 2025 (15% of total estimated tax) |
| Advance tax — 2nd instalment | 15 September 2025 (45% cumulative) |
| Advance tax — 3rd instalment | 15 December 2025 (75% cumulative) |
| Advance tax — 4th instalment | 15 March 2026 (100%) |
| ITR filing deadline (non-audit) | 31 July 2026 |
| ITR filing deadline (audit cases) | 31 October 2026 |
| Belated return | 31 December 2026 |

---

## Section 8 — Loss Offset and Carry-Forward Rules

### The absolute prohibition on loss utilisation

| Rule | Detail | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Loss offset against other income | **NOT PERMITTED** | S. 115BBH(2)(b) |
| Loss offset against other VDA gains | **NOT PERMITTED** — loss from one VDA cannot offset gain from another VDA | S. 115BBH(2)(b) |
| Loss carry-forward | **NOT PERMITTED** | S. 115BBH(2)(b) |
| Loss from other heads against VDA income | **NOT PERMITTED** — losses from any other head cannot reduce VDA income | S. 115BBH(1)(a) read with S.115BBH(2) |
| Infrastructure/business expenses | **NOT DEDUCTIBLE** against VDA transfer income | S. 115BBH(2)(a) |

**This is the most restrictive loss regime in any major jurisdiction.** If you lose ₹5 lakh on BTC and gain ₹5 lakh on ETH in the same year, you pay 30% on ₹5 lakh (the ETH gain) with no offset for the BTC loss.

### Example of the no-offset rule

```
BTC: Bought ₹10,00,000, Sold ₹5,00,000 → Loss: (₹5,00,000) — CANNOT USE
ETH: Bought ₹3,00,000, Sold ₹8,00,000 → Gain: ₹5,00,000

Tax = 30% × ₹5,00,000 = ₹1,50,000 + 4% cess = ₹1,56,000
The ₹5,00,000 BTC loss is permanently lost.
```

---

## Section 9 — Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 No Wash Sale Rule (but irrelevant)

India has **no specific wash sale rule** for crypto. However, this is irrelevant because:
- Losses cannot be offset against anything anyway (S.115BBH(2)(b))
- There is no benefit to crystallising a loss since it cannot be used

### 9.2 Anti-Avoidance Provisions

| Provision | Effect |
|---|---|
| General Anti-Avoidance Rule (GAAR) — Chapter X-A | Applies to impermissible avoidance arrangements; can recharacterise VDA transactions |
| Section 56(2)(x) — Gift taxation | VDA received without consideration or for inadequate consideration (>₹50,000) is taxable as income of the recipient |
| Benami Transactions | Holding VDA in another person's name is covered under the Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act |
| Transfer pricing | Applicable to international VDA transactions between related parties |

### 9.3 TDS as Anti-Avoidance

The 1% TDS under Section 194S serves a dual purpose:
- Revenue collection at source
- Creating an **audit trail** — every VDA transfer is tracked via Form 26AS/AIS

---

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Simple BTC Sale

**Input:** Indian resident individual. Bought 1 BTC at ₹20,00,000 in January 2025. Sold 1 BTC at ₹50,00,000 in September 2025. Exchange fee: ₹5,000 (NOT deductible). Total other income: ₹8,00,000.

**Computation:**
```
Consideration:            ₹50,00,000
Cost of acquisition:      ₹20,00,000
Income from VDA transfer: ₹30,00,000

Tax on VDA: 30% × ₹30,00,000 = ₹9,00,000
Cess: 4% × ₹9,00,000       = ₹36,000
Total VDA tax:                ₹9,36,000

Surcharge: Total income = ₹8,00,000 + ₹30,00,000 = ₹38,00,000
  Below ₹50 lakh → Nil surcharge

TDS already deducted by exchange: 1% × ₹50,00,000 = ₹50,000
  (creditable against total tax liability)

Net VDA tax payable: ₹9,36,000 – ₹50,000 = ₹8,86,000
Exchange fee of ₹5,000 is NOT deductible.
```

### Example 2 — Multiple VDAs, No Loss Offset

**Input:** Indian resident. FY 2025-26 transactions:
- Sold SOL: Cost ₹2,00,000, Proceeds ₹5,00,000, Gain ₹3,00,000
- Sold DOGE: Cost ₹4,00,000, Proceeds ₹1,00,000, Loss (₹3,00,000)
- Received 0.1 ETH staking reward: FMV ₹25,000

**Computation:**
```
SOL gain: ₹3,00,000 → Tax: 30% = ₹90,000
DOGE loss: (₹3,00,000) → CANNOT offset against SOL gain
Staking income: ₹25,000 → Taxed at applicable slab rate (not 30%)

VDA transfer tax: ₹90,000 + 4% cess = ₹93,600
Staking income tax: at slab rate on ₹25,000

Total: ₹93,600 + slab tax on ₹25,000
The DOGE loss of ₹3,00,000 is permanently lost.
```

### Example 3 — Gift of VDA

**Input:** A receives 0.5 BTC as gift from a friend (non-relative). FMV at time of gift: ₹15,00,000. A later sells for ₹20,00,000.

**Computation:**
```
Gift taxation (S. 56(2)(x)):
  FMV of gift: ₹15,00,000 (exceeds ₹50,000)
  Taxable as income from other sources: ₹15,00,000
  Tax: at applicable slab rate

On subsequent transfer (S. 115BBH):
  Proceeds: ₹20,00,000
  Cost of acquisition: ₹0 (cost to previous owner for gifts from
    non-relatives — or FMV if S.49 applies)
  Gain: ₹20,00,000
  Tax: 30% × ₹20,00,000 = ₹6,00,000 + cess

Note: There is potential double taxation on the FMV amount.

## Self-Checks

- [ ] Has the 30% flat rate (plus cess and surcharge) been applied to ALL VDA transfer income?
- [ ] Have losses been correctly excluded from any offset (no inter-VDA, no inter-head offset)?
- [ ] Is only the cost of acquisition deducted — no fees, commissions, or improvement costs?
- [ ] Has 1% TDS been accounted for (either by exchange or buyer in P2P)?
- [ ] Is Schedule VDA completed for every VDA transaction?
- [ ] Has staking/mining income been separately classified under "income from other sources"?
- [ ] Have advance tax obligations been considered (15 June, 15 Sep, 15 Dec, 15 Mar)?
- [ ] Is the correct ITR form used (ITR-2 or ITR-3)?
- [ ] Have gifts of VDA been checked against the ₹50,000 threshold under S.56(2)(x)?
- [ ] Has TDS credit been verified in Form 26AS / AIS?

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER offset crypto losses against any income — it is explicitly prohibited under S.115BBH(2)(b)
- NEVER deduct exchange fees, gas fees, or any cost other than cost of acquisition
- NEVER apply capital gains exemptions (like S.54, S.54F) to VDA income
- NEVER treat VDA differently based on holding period — there is no LTCG/STCG distinction for VDA
- NEVER ignore the 1% TDS obligation on VDA transfers
- NEVER assume mining/staking income falls under the 30% regime — it is typically "income from other sources" at slab rates
- NEVER apply loss carry-forward for VDA — it does not exist
- NEVER ignore advance tax obligations for VDA income
- NEVER treat transfers between own wallets as taxable transfers
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
