# India — Tax Optimization Skill v1.0

---

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | India (Republic of India) |
| Currency | INR (₹) |
| Tax year | Financial Year: 1 April – 31 March (FY 2026-27) |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Act, 2025 (replacing ITA 1961 from 1 April 2026); section references below show both old (1961) and new (2025) numbers |
| Anti-avoidance | GAAR (Chapter X-A / Chapter XIX of IT Act 2025); SAAR provisions throughout |
| Tax authority | Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT); Income Tax Department |
| Filing deadline | 31 July (individuals without audit); 31 October (businesses requiring audit) |
| Individual top rate | 30% + 4% health & education cess = 31.2% (old regime); surcharge up to 25% on high incomes |
| Corporate tax (domestic, new manufacturing) | 15% + cess (s 115BAB) |
| Corporate tax (domestic, general) | 22% + cess (s 115BAA) or 25%/30% under regular provisions |
| GST rates | 0%, 5%, 12%, 18%, 28% |

### New Regime Tax Slabs (Default from FY 2025-26 onwards)

| Taxable Income (₹) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 4,00,000 | 0% |
| 4,00,001 – 8,00,000 | 5% |
| 8,00,001 – 12,00,000 | 10% |
| 12,00,001 – 16,00,000 | 15% |
| 16,00,001 – 20,00,000 | 20% |
| 20,00,001 – 24,00,000 | 25% |
| 24,00,001+ | 30% |

Section 87A rebate: zero tax up to ₹12,00,000 taxable income (₹12,75,000 for salaried with standard deduction) under new regime.

### Old Regime Tax Slabs

| Taxable Income (₹) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 2,50,000 | 0% |
| 2,50,001 – 5,00,000 | 5% |
| 5,00,001 – 10,00,000 | 20% |
| 10,00,001+ | 30% |

Old regime allows HRA, 80C, 80D, Section 24(b), and other deductions. Must opt in (new regime is default).

---

## Section 2 — Income Splitting & Structuring

### Old Regime vs New Regime Selection

**New regime wins when:** total deductions (excluding standard deduction) are below ~₹4,50,000–₹5,50,000. Common for young professionals without home loans, low rent, minimal investments.

**Old regime wins when:** total deductions exceed ~₹5,50,000. Typical triggers:
- Active home loan (₹2,00,000 interest under Section 24(b) / new s 55(1))
- Metro rent with high HRA exemption (Section 10(13A))
- Maxed 80C (₹1,50,000) + 80CCD(1B) NPS (₹50,000) + 80D health insurance (₹25,000+)

**Decision rule:** compute tax under both regimes every year. The regime can be switched annually for salaried individuals (employees must inform employer at start of FY; ITR allows final choice).

### Sole Proprietor vs Company vs LLP

**Sole proprietor:** presumptive taxation available under s 44AD (new s 68) — 6% of digital receipts / 8% of cash receipts deemed profit if turnover ≤₹3 crore. No books of account required. Profit taxed at individual slab rates.

**LLP:** no dividend distribution tax. Partners taxed on profit share (exempt under s 10(2A)). Remuneration to partners: deductible to LLP, taxable to partner. Effective combined rate can be lower than individual rates at higher profit levels.

**Private Limited Company (Pvt Ltd):** 22% + cess (s 115BAA) = ~25.17% effective. Dividends taxed to shareholder at slab rates. DDT abolished from FY 2020-21.

### Family Structuring

- **HUF (Hindu Undivided Family):** separate taxable entity with its own ₹2,50,000 exemption and deductions. Useful for joint family assets. Can invest in 80C instruments independently.
- **Spouse salary:** pay spouse for genuine work in the business. Must be reasonable and documented. Otherwise clubbing provisions (s 64 / new s 14) apply.
- **Minor child income:** clubbed with higher-earning parent (exemption: ₹1,500/child). Exception: income from child's own manual work or special talent.

---

## Section 4 — Capital Allowances Optimization

### Depreciation (Business Income)

| Asset Block | Rate (WDV) |
|---|---|
| Buildings (factory) | 10% |
| Buildings (other) | 5% |
| Furniture and fittings | 10% |
| Plant and machinery (general) | 15% |
| Computers and software | 40% |

**Additional depreciation:** 20% in the first year on new plant and machinery (manufacturing sector, cost >₹25,000). Not available for second-hand assets, office equipment, or vehicles.

### Presumptive Taxation (s 44AD / new s 68)

Businesses with turnover ≤₹3 crore (if digital receipts ≥95% of total): deemed profit at 6% of digital and 8% of cash receipts. No requirement to maintain books. No depreciation claim needed — already factored into deemed rate.

**Professionals (s 44ADA / new s 69):** gross receipts ≤₹75 lakh → deemed profit at 50%. Covers doctors, lawyers, architects, CAs, engineers, etc.

## Section 5 — Loss Utilization

### Set-Off Rules

| Loss Type | Set Off Against |
|---|---|
| Business loss | Any head of income EXCEPT salary (within same year) |
| Capital loss — short-term | Short-term or long-term capital gains |
| Capital loss — long-term | Long-term capital gains only |
| House property loss | Any income, capped at ₹2,00,000 per year |
| Speculation business loss | Speculation business income only |

### Carry Forward

| Loss Type | Carry Forward Period |
|---|---|
| Business loss | 8 years |
| Capital loss | 8 years |
| Unabsorbed depreciation | Unlimited |
| House property loss | 8 years |

Return must be filed by the due date (s 139(1)) to carry forward losses (except house property loss and unabsorbed depreciation). **Missing the deadline forfeits carry-forward.**

---

## Section 6 — Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Invest in 80C by 31 March | ELSS (3-year lock-in), PPF, LIC premiums, SSY, NPS. Last-minute investments still qualify for current FY deduction |
| Advance tax instalments | Due 15 June (15%), 15 Sept (45%), 15 Dec (75%), 15 March (100%). Defer to later instalments if income is seasonal — avoids unnecessary early payments |
| Harvesting LTCG exemption (listed equity) | LTCG on listed shares/equity MFs: ₹1,25,000 exempt annually (s 112A). Sell and rebuy annually to crystallise gains within exemption |
| Rent receipts | Collect and preserve rent receipts. If HRA claimed, landlord PAN mandatory if rent >₹1,00,000/year |
| Medical bills | Aggregate family medical expenses before 31 March for 80D claims. Preventive health check-up within ₹5,000 sub-limit |
| Capital gains reinvestment | s 54 (residential house from house sale), s 54EC (specified bonds — ₹50 lakh cap, 5-year lock-in). Invest within specified timelines to defer/exempt gains |
| NPS contribution timing | Employer NPS: ensure reflected in Form 16 / Form 130 (new). Self-contribution: invest by 31 March for current-year deduction |

---

## Section 7 — GST Optimization

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Registration threshold | ₹40 lakh for goods (₹20 lakh in special category states); ₹20 lakh for services (₹10 lakh in special category states) |
| Composition scheme | Turnover ≤₹1.5 crore: pay 1% (manufacturers/traders), 5% (restaurants), 6% (services). No input tax credit. No inter-state supply |
| Input Tax Credit (ITC) | Claim GST on business purchases. Must be reflected in GSTR-2B. Reverse charge on specified goods/services |
| E-invoicing | Mandatory for turnover >₹5 crore (from 1 Aug 2023). Generates IRN via NIC portal. Ensures ITC accuracy |
| Inverted duty structure refund | If input GST rate > output GST rate, claim refund of accumulated ITC |
| Export — zero-rated | Exports are zero-rated. Option: export under LUT (Letter of Undertaking) without paying IGST, or pay IGST and claim refund |
| Place of supply rules | Critical for services: B2B services generally taxed at recipient location. Optimise for IGST vs SGST+CGST |

---

## Section 8 — Social Security Optimization

### EPF (Employees' Provident Fund)

- Employee contributes 12% of basic + DA; employer matches 12% (8.33% to EPS, 3.67% to EPF)
- Tax treatment: employee contribution deductible under 80C. Employer contribution exempt up to ₹7.5 lakh/year (combined with NPS, superannuation)
- Interest taxable if employee contribution exceeds ₹2.5 lakh/year (from FY 2021-22)

### NPS (National Pension System)

- **Employer contribution (80CCD(2)/124(2)):** deductible up to 14% of basic (central govt) or 10% (others). Available in BOTH regimes — the single most powerful deduction in the new regime.
- **Employee self-contribution (80CCD(1B)/124(3)):** additional ₹50,000 deduction. Old regime only.
- At retirement: 60% lump sum tax-free; 40% must buy annuity (annuity income taxable)

### ESI (Employees' State Insurance)

- Applicable if salary ≤₹21,000/month. Employee 0.75%, employer 3.25%
- Medical coverage. Contributions reduce take-home but provide insurance

### Optimization

- **Maximise employer NPS** to benefit in both regimes (14% of basic for new regime)
- **Voluntary PF contribution** up to 80C limit if not already maxed
- **Salary structuring:** optimise basic vs allowances. Higher basic = higher EPF/NPS employer contribution (deductible) but higher PF outflow. Balance based on individual needs.

## Section 9 — Investment & Retirement

| Instrument | Tax Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PPF | EEE (exempt-exempt-exempt) | ₹1.5L/year cap. 15-year lock-in. Interest tax-free |
| ELSS | Deduction under 80C. LTCG >₹1.25L taxed at 12.5% | 3-year lock-in. Shortest among 80C options |
| NPS | Deduction on contribution. 60% lump sum tax-free at retirement | Annuity portion taxable |
| Sukanya Samriddhi (SSY) | EEE | For girl child. ₹1.5L/year within 80C cap |
| NSC | Deduction under 80C. Interest accrued qualifies for 80C in subsequent years | 5-year lock-in |
| ULIPs | 80C deduction. Tax-free maturity if premium ≤₹2.5L/year | >₹2.5L premium: LTCG on maturity |
| Direct equity / equity MFs | STCG: 20%. LTCG >₹1.25L: 12.5%. No indexation | Annual LTCG harvesting strategy applies |
| Debt MFs | Taxed at slab rates | No indexation benefit (post FY 2023-24 rules) |
| Real estate | LTCG: 12.5% (without indexation from FY 2024-25). STCG: slab rates | s 54/54EC reinvestment exemptions available |

### Annual LTCG Harvesting

Sell listed equity/MF units showing gains up to ₹1,25,000 LTCG (exempt) on 31 March, rebuy on 1 April. Resets cost base. Zero tax on harvested gains. Repeat annually.

---

## Section 10 — Red Lines (GAAR & Scrutiny Triggers)

### GAAR (General Anti-Avoidance Rule)

Chapter X-A (old ITA) / Chapter XIX (IT Act 2025). Effective from 1 April 2017. Applies if an arrangement: (i) creates a tax benefit, (ii) the main purpose is to obtain tax benefit, and (iii) it lacks commercial substance. Consequence: tax benefit denied; income recharacterised.

Threshold: tax benefit must exceed ₹3 crore to trigger. Impermissible avoidance agreements defined broadly.

### Scrutiny Triggers

| Trigger | Risk |
|---|---|
| HRA claimed without genuine rent payment | Disallowed; penalty |
| Bogus 80C/80D receipts | Prosecution possible. LIC/health insurer reports to IT dept |
| Cash deposits >₹10 lakh in savings or ₹2.5 lakh in current account | Automatic SFT reporting to IT department |
| High-value transactions (immovable property >₹30 lakh, securities >₹10 lakh) | Statement of Financial Transactions (SFT) cross-matching |
| Income mismatch with AIS (Annual Information Statement) | Most common trigger for notice u/s 148 |
| Capital gains without payment of advance tax | Interest u/s 234B and 234C |
| Gift from non-relatives exceeding ₹50,000 | Taxable as income u/s 56(2)(x) / new equivalent |
| Benami property transactions | Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act — severe penalties including confiscation |
| Clubbing provisions violations | Transferring income-generating assets to spouse/minor → income attributed back |
| Presumptive tax with inconsistent lifestyle | Risk of scrutiny if declared income is disproportionately low |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- NEVER advise fabricating rent receipts for HRA claims
- NEVER advise backdating investments to claim deductions in a prior year
- NEVER advise cash transactions exceeding ₹2 lakh (penalty equal to amount, s 271DA)
- NEVER advise accepting or paying cash exceeding ₹10,000 for expenses (unless specific exceptions)
- NEVER advise structuring transactions solely to stay below GAAR thresholds
- NEVER advise ignoring AIS discrepancies — resolve before filing

---

## Section 12 — Cash Impact Examples

### Example 1 — Old vs New Regime (Salaried, ₹15 lakh CTC)

**New regime:** ₹15,00,000 – ₹75,000 (standard deduction) = ₹14,25,000 taxable. Tax: ₹1,57,500 + cess = ₹1,63,800.

**Old regime with deductions:** ₹15,00,000 – ₹50,000 (standard) – ₹1,50,000 (80C) – ₹50,000 (80CCD(1B)) – ₹25,000 (80D) – ₹2,00,000 (home loan s 24(b)) – ₹2,40,000 (HRA) = ₹8,85,000 taxable. Tax: ₹77,000 + cess = ₹80,080.

**Saving under old regime: ~₹83,720.** Old regime clearly wins with ₹6.65L deductions.

### Example 2 — NPS Employer Contribution (New Regime)

**Salary restructure:** basic ₹8,00,000. Employer contributes 14% to NPS = ₹1,12,000.

This ₹1,12,000 is deductible in BOTH regimes. At 20% marginal rate: **₹22,400 tax saving** + retirement corpus growth.

### Example 3 — LTCG Harvesting (Listed Equity)

Portfolio unrealised gains: ₹3,00,000. Sell units showing ₹1,25,000 LTCG → zero tax (exempt). Rebuy next day. Reset cost base. Remaining ₹1,75,000 deferred to next year.

Without harvesting: eventual ₹3,00,000 – ₹1,25,000 exempt = ₹1,75,000 × 12.5% = ₹21,875 tax.
With annual harvesting over 3 years: **₹0 tax. Saving: ₹21,875.**

### Example 4 — Presumptive Taxation (s 44AD)

Small trader, ₹1.5 crore turnover (all digital). Deemed profit: 6% = ₹9,00,000. Tax under old regime with 80C: ~₹52,000 + cess.

Actual profit: ₹12,00,000 (8%). Electing regular taxation: higher tax + audit + compliance cost. **Presumptive saves ~₹40,000+ in tax and ₹50,000+ in compliance costs.**
