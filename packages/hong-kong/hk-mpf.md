## Section 3 -- Voluntary Contributions and Tax Deductions

### 3.1 Tax Deductible Voluntary Contributions (TVC)

|---|---|
| Legislation | IRO Sec. 26J (effective 2019/20 onwards) |
| Who can claim | Any MPF scheme member (employee, self-employed, non-employed) |
| Contribution to | Special TVC account in MPFA-approved scheme |
| Tax deduction limit | HK$60,000 per year |
| Combined cap | TVC + QDAP (qualifying deferred annuity) together capped at HK$60,000 |
| Scheme | Must be designated TVC account (NOT regular voluntary/SVC) |
| Withdrawal | Only at age 65, retirement, permanent departure, or other qualifying events |

### 3.2 Special Voluntary Contributions (SVC) -- Non-Deductible

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|

| Employee SVC | Employee contributes extra to existing scheme; NOT tax-deductible |
| Difference from TVC | SVC goes into regular account; TVC goes into special TVC account |

### 3.3 Computation of Tax Benefit (TVC)

```
Annual TVC contribution (max $60,000)
× Marginal tax rate (2% to 17% progressive, or 15% standard)
= Tax saving

Example:
- TVC contribution: $60,000
- Marginal rate: 17%
- Tax saving: $60,000 × 17% = $10,200
```

## Section 4 -- Computation Examples

### Example 1 -- Standard Employee (Income $25,000/month)

| Party | Calculation | Monthly Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Employer | 5% × $25,000 | $1,250 |
| Employee | 5% × $25,000 | $1,250 |
| Total to MPF account | | $2,500 |

Annual: Employee contributes $15,000 (deductible up to $18,000 cap for salaries tax).

### Example 2 -- High-Income Employee ($80,000/month)

| Party | Calculation | Monthly Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Employer | 5% × $30,000 (capped) | $1,500 |
| Employee | 5% × $30,000 (capped) | $1,500 |
| Total to MPF account | | $3,000 |

Annual employee mandatory: $18,000 (fully deductible -- equals cap).

### Example 3 -- Low-Income Employee ($6,000/month)

| Party | Calculation | Monthly Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Employer | 5% × $6,000 | $300 |
| Employee | 0% (below $7,100 threshold) | $0 |
| Total to MPF account | | $300 |

### Example 4 -- Self-Employed (Annual Profit $500,000)

| Basis | Calculation | Annual Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly equivalent | $500,000 / 12 = $41,667 | |
| Mandatory (capped) | 5% × $30,000 × 12 | $18,000/year |
| Additional TVC (optional) | Up to $60,000 | Tax-deductible |
| Maximum total | | $78,000/year |

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Multiple Employments

- Each employer must contribute separately
- Employee contributes 5% to each scheme
- Combined employee contributions may exceed $18,000/year tax deduction cap
- Tax deduction still capped at $18,000 for mandatory across all employments

### 6.2 Employee Becomes Self-Employed

- Employee account becomes "preserved" on leaving employment
- Self-employed opens new self-employed account
- May consolidate accounts into one personal account
- Previous employer contributions preserved until qualifying event

### 6.3 Part-Time / Multiple Part-Time Jobs

- Each employer with ≥60 days employment must enrol
- Income threshold ($7,100) applies per employment separately
- Part-time worker earning $5,000 from employer A and $4,000 from employer B:
  - Employer A: contributes 5% × $5,000 = $250; employee contributes $0 (below threshold)
  - Employer B: contributes 5% × $4,000 = $200; employee contributes $0 (below threshold)

### 6.4 Non-Monetary Benefits

- Non-cash benefits (housing, company car) are NOT relevant income for MPF
- Only monetary payments count towards MPF calculation
- Exception: if benefit is commutable to cash at employee's option, it may be relevant income

### 6.5 MPF Offset Mechanism

| Item | Rule |
|---|---|
| Severance payment offset | Employer may offset SP against employer MPF contributions (from accrued benefits derived from employer contributions) |
| Long service payment offset | Same as above |
| Abolition (planned) | Government announced phased abolition from 2025 -- transition period applies |
| Current position (2024/25) | Offset still permitted during transition |
