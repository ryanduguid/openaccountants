| Primary authority | IRAS e-Tax Guide: Income Tax Treatment of Digital Tokens (9 October 2020) |
| GST authority | IRAS e-Tax Guide: GST — Digital Payment Tokens (17 November 2019, effective 1 January 2020) |

| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Key Principle

Singapore has **no capital gains tax**. Gains from disposal of crypto assets held as **long-term investments** are capital in nature and **not taxable**. However, if crypto activities constitute a **trade or business**, profits are taxable as ordinary **income** under the Income Tax Act 1947 (ITA).

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether trading or investment | Assess against badges of trade; if unclear, treat as potentially taxable (trading) and seek IRAS ruling |
| Unknown token classification | Treat as payment token (most common) |
| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without acquisition cost |
| Unknown residency | STOP — affects Singapore-source income determination |
| Unknown whether mining is hobby or business | Companies → presumed business; individuals → evaluate frequency and scale |

---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 IRAS Digital Token Classification

IRAS classifies digital tokens into three categories for tax purposes (per the e-Tax Guide, October 2020):

| Token Type | Definition | Examples | Tax Treatment on Disposal |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Payment tokens** | Tokens that function or are intended to function as a medium of exchange | BTC, ETH, LTC, XRP, SOL, stablecoins (USDT, USDC) | Capital gain (not taxable) if investment; income if trading business |
| **Utility tokens** | Tokens that provide access to a current or prospective product/service on a DLT platform | Filecoin (FIL), BAT, service access tokens | Capital gain (not taxable) if investment; income if trading business |
| **Security tokens** | Tokens that represent ownership rights (equity, debt, units in a fund) | Tokenised shares, tokenised bonds, fund tokens | May attract withholding tax if dividend-like distributions; capital gain (not taxable) if investment disposal |

### 2.2 Taxable vs Non-Taxable Events

| Event | Taxable? | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Disposal of crypto investment (capital gain) | **No** | Held as long-term investment; no capital gains tax in Singapore |
| Disposal of crypto trading stock (revenue gain) | **Yes** | Part of a trading business; taxed as income |
| Receiving crypto as payment for goods/services | **Yes** | Revenue of the business at FMV when received |
| Mining rewards (company) | **Yes** | Presumed business income for companies |
| Mining rewards (individual, habitual) | **Yes** | If habitual and systematic → vocation income |
| Mining rewards (individual, hobby) | **No** | Prima facie hobby; capital gain on disposal not taxable |
| Staking / DeFi yields (business) | **Yes** | Business income at FMV when received |
| Staking / DeFi yields (individual, occasional) | **No** | Capital in nature if not part of a business |
| Airdrop (no service provided) | **No** | Windfall gain; not taxable; cost basis = S$0 |
| Airdrop (in exchange for a service) | **Yes** | Income at FMV when received |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap (investor) | **No** | Capital transaction; no CGT |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap (trader) | **Yes** | Revenue transaction; gain/loss is taxable |
| Transfer between own wallets | **No** | No change in beneficial ownership |

**YA 2025 rebate:** 60% personal income tax rebate, capped at S$200.

### 3.2 Corporate Income Tax Rate

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Headline rate | 17% |
| First S$10,000 chargeable income | 75% exemption → effective 4.25% |
| Next S$190,000 chargeable income | 50% exemption → effective 8.5% |

---

## Section 4 -- Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 Accepted Methods

| Method | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Specific identification | Acceptable | Must be clearly documented |
| FIFO (First In, First Out) | Acceptable | Commonly used; IRAS does not mandate a specific method |
| Weighted average cost | Acceptable | Particularly for fungible tokens traded in volume |
| LIFO | Not commonly used | Not prohibited but may be questioned |

**Consistent application:** Once a method is chosen, apply it consistently across the tax year and across years.

### 4.2 Cost Basis Components

- Purchase price in SGD (convert foreign currency at exchange rate on acquisition date)
- Exchange/trading fees and commissions on acquisition
- Network/gas fees directly attributable to the acquisition
- Any other directly incurred acquisition costs

### 4.3 For Businesses (Revenue Assets)

- Cost basis = purchase price + incidental acquisition costs
- Standard accounting principles (FRS 102 / SFRS(I)) apply
- Inventory valuation: lower of cost or net realisable value at year-end

---

## Section 5 -- DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrops

### 5.1 Mining

**Per IRAS e-Tax Guide (Digital Tokens, paras 3.1--3.5):**

| Scenario | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Company mining | Business income — taxed at point of **disposal**, not at mining receipt. Company can claim mining expenses (electricity, hardware, etc.) as deductions. |
| Individual mining (habitual, systematic) | Vocation income — profits from sale of mined tokens are taxable |
| Individual mining (hobby) | Not taxable — gains on sale are capital gains (no CGT) |

**Key nuance:** For miners, IRAS taxes at the **point of disposal**, not at receipt. The miner holds the token at cost (incurred mining costs) until sold.

### 5.2 Staking and DeFi

| Activity | Business Context | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Staking rewards | Part of business operations | Business income at FMV when received; or at disposal depending on accounting |
| Staking rewards | Individual, passive | Likely capital in nature; not taxable |
| DeFi lending interest | Business | Taxable income |
| DeFi lending interest | Individual, passive | Likely capital; not taxable (but grey area — conservative: taxable) |
| Liquidity provision | Business | Revenue activity; gains taxable |
| Liquidity provision | Individual | Capital activity if passive; no specific IRAS guidance |
| Yield farming | Business | Taxable income at FMV |

### 5.3 Airdrops and Hard Forks

| Event | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop (no consideration given) | Not income; cost basis = S$0; gain on disposal is capital (not taxable for investors) |
| Airdrop (in return for service, e.g. referral) | Taxable income at FMV |
| Hard fork (new coin received) | Not a taxable event; cost basis of new coin = S$0; original coin cost basis unchanged |

---

## Section 6 -- NFT Treatment

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Purchase of NFT | Acquisition at cost — cost basis for future disposal |
| Sale of NFT (investor) | Capital gain — not taxable (no CGT) |
| Sale of NFT (trader/business) | Taxable business income |
| Creation and sale of NFT (artist/creator) | Business income if habitual; hobby income if occasional |
| NFT → NFT swap (investor) | Capital transaction — not taxable |
| NFT → NFT swap (trader) | Revenue transaction — taxable |
| NFT royalties | Income when received; taxable if part of business or vocation |
| GST on NFT sales | If NFT is not a digital payment token → standard GST rules may apply (9% from 1 January 2024) |

---

## Section 7 -- Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Badges of Trade (Trader vs Investor Determination)

IRAS applies the common law "badges of trade" to distinguish trading (taxable) from investment (not taxable):

| Badge | Indicates Trading | Indicates Investment |
|---|---|---|
| Subject matter | Commodities or items typically traded | Assets typically held for long-term appreciation |
| Frequency of transactions | High volume, repeated transactions | Infrequent, isolated transactions |
| Holding period | Short (days to weeks) | Long (months to years) |
| Supplementary work | Value-added activities (market making, arbitrage) | No additional work beyond buy-and-hold |
| Circumstances of sale | Systematic selling pattern | Sold only when needed or at opportune time |
| Motive/intention | Profit from short-term price movements | Long-term capital appreciation |
| Financing | Borrowed funds to trade | Own savings |
| Organisation | Business-like structure, dedicated accounts | Casual, alongside primary employment |

### 7.2 Filing Forms

| Form | Who Files | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Form B (individuals with self-employment / business income) | Individuals with crypto trading business income | 15 April (paper) / 18 April (e-filing) |
| Form B1 (individuals with employment income only) | Individuals with crypto employment payment only | 15 April (paper) / 18 April (e-filing) |
| Form C-S / Form C (companies) | Companies with crypto business income | 30 November of YA |
| ECI (Estimated Chargeable Income) | Companies | Within 3 months of financial year-end |

### 7.3 GST Reporting

**Legal basis:** IRAS e-Tax Guide: GST — Digital Payment Tokens (effective 1 January 2020).

| Transaction | GST Treatment |
|---|---|
| Exchange of digital payment tokens for fiat (or vice versa) | **Exempt supply** (no GST) |
| Exchange of digital payment tokens for other digital payment tokens | **Exempt supply** |
| Use of digital payment tokens to pay for goods/services | GST on the goods/services; **not** on the token itself |
| ICO (issuance of payment tokens) | **Exempt supply** |
| Supply of utility tokens | Depends on underlying supply — may be standard-rated (9%) or exempt |
| Mining services (identifiable recipient) | Standard-rated supply (9%) |
| NFT sale | Not a digital payment token — standard GST rules apply |

**GST registration threshold:** S$1 million in taxable supplies in past 12 months (or expected next 12 months). Exempt supplies (including payment token exchanges) count towards the threshold for registration purposes.

### 7.4 No FBAR Equivalent

Singapore does not have an FBAR-like foreign asset reporting obligation for individuals. However:
- Businesses holding significant crypto may have reporting obligations under MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) regulations
- Licensed payment service providers under the Payment Services Act 2019 have AML/CFT reporting requirements

---

## Section 8 -- Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Trading losses | Can offset against other income in the same YA (Section 37 ITA) |
| Carry-forward of unabsorbed losses | Indefinite carry-forward, subject to shareholding test (Section 37 ITA) |
| Carry-back | Up to 3 preceding YAs, capped at S$100,000 per YA (Section 37E ITA) — for companies only |
| Capital losses | Not deductible — there is no capital gains tax regime to offset against |
| Investment losses (individual) | Not deductible — capital in nature |

---

## Section 9 -- Anti-Avoidance Rules

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| General anti-avoidance (Section 33 ITA) | IRAS can disregard or vary any arrangement that has the purpose of tax avoidance |
| Transfer pricing (Section 34D ITA) | Arm's length standard applies to related-party crypto transactions |
| Substance over form | IRAS may recharacterise transactions based on economic substance |
| Recharacterisation of capital as revenue | If IRAS determines activity is trading despite taxpayer's claim of investment, gains become taxable |
| MAS compliance | Unlicensed crypto activities may attract regulatory scrutiny and affect tax positions |

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Long-Term Investor (Not Taxable)

**Input:** Singapore tax resident individual. Employed full-time as a software engineer. Bought 2 BTC at S$40,000 each in 2022. Sold 2 BTC at S$75,000 each in 2024. Total 2 transactions in 2 years. Used personal savings.

**Analysis:**
```
Proceeds:           2 × S$75,000 = S$150,000
Cost basis:         2 × S$40,000 = S$80,000
Gain:               S$70,000

Badges of trade assessment:
  Frequency:        Low (1 buy, 1 sell over 2 years)
  Holding period:   Long (~2 years)
  Motive:           Long-term appreciation
  Financing:        Own savings
  Organisation:     Casual, alongside employment

Classification:     INVESTMENT (capital gain)
Tax:                NOT TAXABLE — no capital gains tax in Singapore
```

**Reporting:** No reporting required for YA 2025 (income earned 2024). Gain is capital in nature.

### Example 2 -- Active Trader (Taxable)

**Input:** Singapore tax resident individual. No other employment. Traded crypto full-time on Binance in 2024. Made 500+ trades, average holding period 3 days. Used leverage. Total revenue: S$200,000 from cost basis of S$120,000. Net trading gain: S$80,000.

**Analysis:**
```
Revenue:            S$200,000
Cost of tokens:     S$120,000
Net gain:           S$80,000

Badges of trade assessment:
  Frequency:        Very high (500+ trades)
  Holding period:   Very short (3 days average)
  Motive:           Short-term profit
  Financing:        Used leverage
  Organisation:     Full-time, sole activity

Classification:     TRADING (business income)
Tax computation:    Chargeable income S$80,000
  First S$20,000 @ 0%    = S$0
  Next S$10,000 @ 2%     = S$200
  Next S$10,000 @ 3.5%   = S$350
  Next S$40,000 @ 7%     = S$2,800
  Total tax:              = S$3,350
  Less YA 2025 rebate (60%, max S$200): -S$200
  Net tax payable:        = S$3,150
```

**Reporting:** File Form B by 18 April 2025. Declare as trade/business income.

### Example 3 -- Company Mining Operation

**Input:** Singapore-incorporated company. Mines ETH using dedicated hardware. Revenue in 2024: 50 ETH sold at average S$4,000 each = S$200,000. Mining costs (electricity, hardware depreciation, hosting): S$80,000.

**Analysis:**
```
Revenue:            S$200,000
Expenses:           S$80,000
Chargeable income:  S$120,000

Corporate tax (17%):
  First S$10,000:   75% exempt → taxable S$2,500 @ 17% = S$425
  Next S$110,000:   → S$190,000 bracket, 50% exempt → taxable S$55,000 @ 17% = S$9,350
  Total tax:        S$9,775
```

**Reporting:** File ECI within 3 months of year-end. File Form C-S/C by 30 November 2025.
