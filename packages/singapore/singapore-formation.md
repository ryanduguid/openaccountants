## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-SG-F1 -- No resident director.** "At least one director must be ordinarily resident in Singapore. A Pte Ltd cannot be incorporated without this. If no founder qualifies, a nominee director service must be engaged."

**R-SG-F2 -- Forgetting company secretary.** "A company secretary must be appointed within 6 months of incorporation. The sole director cannot also serve as sole secretary. Failure to appoint results in ACRA penalties and potential strike-off."

**R-SG-F3 -- S$1 capital and EP application.** "While S$1 is the legal minimum capital, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) evaluates EP applications based on company viability. Very low capital signals insufficient substance. Recommend S$50,000+ paid-up capital for EP-linked companies."

**R-SG-F4 -- Shell company without substance.** "Singapore takes anti-money-laundering seriously. ACRA and MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) actively scrutinise companies without genuine business activity. This skill will not assist in forming a company intended solely as a conduit without real operations."

**R-SG-F5 -- Missing ECI filing.** "ECI must be filed within 3 months of financial year-end, even if estimated income is nil. Failure to file triggers IRAS penalties and a Notice of Assessment based on IRAS's own estimate."

**R-SG-F6 -- Operating without EP.** "Foreign individuals performing work in Singapore (including as company directors managing day-to-day operations) without a valid work pass violate the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act, which carries criminal penalties."

## Section 10 -- Timeline

| Step | Duration | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| Reserve company name (BizFile+) | 1 day (often instant) | Day 1 |
| Prepare constitution and officer details | 1--3 days | Day 2--4 |
| File incorporation (BizFile+) | 1 day | Day 3--5 |
| ACRA processes incorporation | 1--2 days (straightforward) | Day 4--7 |
| Certificate of Incorporation received | Same day as approval | Day 4--7 |
| Open corporate bank account | 1--3 days (resident) / 1--4 weeks (non-resident) | Day 5--35 |
| IRAS corporate tax file number (automatic) | 1--2 weeks | Day 11--21 |
| Apply for EP (if needed) | 3--8 weeks | Day 7--63 |
| Appoint company secretary | Within 6 months | Day 1--180 |
| **Ready to trade** | | **As fast as 1 week (Singapore-resident founder)** |
