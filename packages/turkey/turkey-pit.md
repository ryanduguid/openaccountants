## Section 7 — Worked example

**Scenario:** Freelance software developer, 2025 annual income 600,000 TRY, allowable expenses 30,000 TRY, no other deductions. No provisional tax paid.

| Step | Description | Amount (TRY) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross income | Professional income §40(4) | 600,000 |
| − Expenses | Documented business costs | (30,000) |
| **Taxable base** | | **570,000** |

Tax computation on 570,000 TRY:

| Bracket | Taxable in bracket | Rate | Tax |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 158,000 | 158,000 | 15% | 23,700 |
| 158,001 – 330,000 | 172,000 | 20% | 34,400 |
| 330,001 – 570,000 | 240,000 | 27% | 64,800 |
| **Total tax** | | | **122,900 TRY** |

If 50,000 TRY provisional tax was paid during the year:
**122,900 − 50,000 = 72,900 TRY** payable at filing (2 instalments: 36,450 March + 36,450 July).
