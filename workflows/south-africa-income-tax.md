## 6-phase structure

### Phase 1 — Intake
Confirm: income sources (salary, freelance, rental, investment), tax year (SARS tax year: March 1 – February 28/29), marital status, age (affects rebate tier), medical scheme members.

### Phase 2 — Gross income
Salary/remuneration, freelance/business income, rental income, investment income (interest, dividends). Apply exempt amounts (interest exemption, dividend withholding tax treatment).

### Phase 3 — Deductions
RA contributions, pension/provident fund contributions, travel allowance (log book vs SARS table), home office (if qualifying conditions met), medical scheme fees tax credit (MSFTC) — R364/month main member, R246/month each dependant (2024 values; check bundle for current year).

### Phase 4 — Tax computation
Apply SARS tax tables. Subtract primary, secondary, and tertiary rebates based on age. Subtract MSFTC. Check if additional medical tax credit applies (qualifying medical expenses > 7.5% of taxable income, for those under 65 not on medical scheme).

### Phase 5 — Provisional tax
If taxable income includes non-employment income > R30,000: two IRP6 payments required. First period: by 31 August (based on 50% of estimated full-year liability). Second period: by 28 February (balance of estimated full-year liability). Third voluntary payment available by 30 September.
