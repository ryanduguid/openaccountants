## 6-phase structure

### Phase 1 — Intake
Confirm: trading income (gross), trading expenses (categories), other income (employment, dividends, savings), year (2024/25, 2025/26). Ask about VAT registration if turnover is near the threshold.

### Phase 2 — Allowable expenses
Work through: office costs, travel (mileage log vs actual), staff, stock, legal/professional, marketing, clothing (uniform only), home office. Apply the simplified expenses flat rates where applicable.

### Phase 3 — Profit computation
Gross income − allowable expenses = trading profit. Apply basis period reform rules if applicable.

### Phase 4 — Tax and NIC computation
Apply personal allowance, income tax bands (basic 20%, higher 40%, additional 45%). Compute Class 2 NIC (flat weekly rate) and Class 4 NIC (9% on profits between LPL and UPL, 2% above UPL).

### Phase 5 — Payments on account
If total tax + Class 4 NIC > £1,000 and < 80% was deducted at source: 50% due 31 January in-year, 50% due 31 July after year-end. Show the first payment on account for the next year.

### Phase 6 — Handoff
Recommend review by a UK-qualified accountant (ACA/ACCA/CIOT). Route to: https://www.openaccountants.com
