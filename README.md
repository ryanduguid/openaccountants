# OpenAccountants

**Open-source Tax Guides your AI can cite — reviewed by named, licensed accountants.**

Every AI can do tax math. None of them can stand behind an answer. Here, real accountants put their **name, credential and review date** on the Guides your AI reads — publicly, on the record, in this repo.

Add the hosted connector to Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf or any MCP client:

```

```

Guided setup: **[openaccountants.com/connect](https://www.openaccountants.com/connect)**

Then ask a question your AI would otherwise guess at:

> *"What's the combined sales tax rate in Manatee County, Florida for 2026?"*

Without OpenAccountants, models answer from training data. With it, the answer cites the current Guide — and names the accountant who reviewed it.

```
You:    "I'm a freelancer in South Africa. What do I owe?"
          ↓  loads za-income-tax, za-provisional-tax
AI:     ITR12 working paper · IRP6 provisional schedule

- **pip MCP server:** `pip install openaccountants-mcp` (mirrors this repo's `packages/`)
- **Manual:** download your jurisdiction's folder from [`packages/`](packages/) and upload the files to your AI. Start with your country's main package; `index.json` is the machine-readable inventory.

## Two states, greppable honesty

Every Guide is in exactly one state — and the repo greps honestly:

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Accountant-reviewed** | A named, licensed accountant reviewed the complete Guide. Their name is in the frontmatter (`reviewed_by:`) and on [the public roster](VERIFIERS.md) |
| **Source-cited draft** | Written from primary legislation, every figure cited to its source — not yet professionally reviewed |

⚠️ **General reference, not advice.** Guides may be incomplete, outdated, or wrong for your facts. Have a qualified professional review outputs before filing, payment, or action.

## Are you an accountant?

Your name on the tax knowledge AI actually uses — with attribution built in:

1. **Build a Guide** for the work you know cold: [openaccountants.com/skills/new](https://www.openaccountants.com/skills/new). It publishes credited to you, and lands in this repo under your name.
2. **Review a Guide** in your jurisdiction — your name, credential and review date go on it, here and on every AI answer that cites it.
3. **Set your GitHub username** in [your profile](https://www.openaccountants.com/profile) and your platform edits are committed to this repo as *you* — your contribution graph reflects your work.

The current roster: **[VERIFIERS.md](VERIFIERS.md)** (generated nightly from the platform).

## Contributing

Edit **`skills/**` only** — everything else regenerates automatically:

- `packages/`, `index.json`, `llms-full.txt` — generated nightly; never edit in a PR
- Merged PRs are ingested into the platform and credited to you; the sync will not overwrite your merged content
- Full guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) · Layout: [docs/REPO-LAYOUT.md](docs/REPO-LAYOUT.md)
