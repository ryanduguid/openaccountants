1,000+ Guides across 190+ jurisdictions. Works with **Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, and any MCP-compatible agent**. Every Guide is either a **source-cited draft** (written from primary legislation, every figure cited) or **accountant-reviewed** (a licensed Partner checked the complete Guide, and their name is on it).

> 🔍 **Real professional review, in public.** In July 2026, Christopher Aryee, CPA reviewed our four core US federal form Guides against the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and returned **33 sourced corrections** (rates, thresholds, statutory citations). The full red-line is public: [see the diff →](https://github.com/openaccountants/openaccountants/pull/45/files) That loop (a named professional publicly correcting the tax data your AI relies on) is the whole point of this project.

⚠️ **General reference only, not advice.** Have a qualified professional review outputs before filing, payment, or action. <details><summary>Read the full disclaimer</summary>

> OpenAccountants provides general tax and accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It is **not** a law firm, accounting firm, tax preparer, or return-filing service, and its outputs are **not** tax, legal, accounting, or financial advice. Guides may be incomplete, outdated, or wrong, and are not reviewed for any specific person's facts, elections, deadlines, residency, or local procedures. Always have a qualified professional review outputs before filing, payment, or action. A *source-cited draft* has **not** been reviewed by a credentialed accountant.

```

**New here?** Read [START-HERE.md](START-HERE.md): scenarios, file lists, what to say to the AI. The full machine-readable inventory of every Guide is [`index.json`](index.json).

### 2. Upload to your AI

- **Claude.ai** → Create a Project, add files as Project Knowledge
- **ChatGPT** → Attach files or create a Custom GPT
- **Any other AI** → Attach or paste the files

### 3. Go

```
Help me with my 2025 taxes. Here's my bank statement.
Help me set up a company in Malta.
Run my payroll for this month.
Prepare my annual accounts.
Optimize my tax. What deductions am I missing?
Check my invoice compliance for EU e-invoicing.
```

The AI asks a few questions, loads the right Guides, and produces a working paper for your accountant.

## How the Guides work

### The supplier pattern library

Every Guide contains a lookup table of local vendors. When the AI sees "BANK OF VALLETTA" or "DEUTSCHE TELEKOM" or "STRIPE PAYMENTS UK LTD" on your bank statement, it already knows the classification. No guessing.

### Three outcomes per transaction

| Outcome | Means | What happens |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| **Classified** | Documents carry enough info | Applied automatically |
| **Assumed** | Data missing, conservative default applied | Flagged for your reviewer |
| **Needs Input** | Can't proceed without asking | One targeted question |

### Conservative defaults

When uncertain, the system always assumes MORE tax, never less. Your accountant can override a conservative position. They can't easily undo an aggressive one.

## Are you an accountant?

Most Guides are source-cited drafts: written from primary legislation but awaiting a credentialed review. Become a **Partner** for your jurisdiction, review a complete Guide, and it becomes accountant-reviewed with your name on every answer the AI gives from it. Christopher Aryee's [33-correction OBBBA review](https://github.com/openaccountants/openaccountants/pull/45/files) is what that looks like in practice.

**You don't need GitHub.** Just:

1. Apply at [openaccountants.com/for-accountants](https://www.openaccountants.com/for-accountants) (credentials reviewed in 1–2 business days)
2. Open a Guide in your review queue, check every figure against the sources
3. Approve it or return sourced corrections. Either way your review is on the record

Or: fork, fix a rate against your tax authority's guidance, PR. **Your name on the Guide either way.**

## Known limitations

- **LLMs hallucinate.** These files steer the model; they don't guarantee correct numbers. Always have a qualified professional review before filing.
- **Tax law changes.** Rates and thresholds go out of date. The repo is a snapshot; [openaccountants.com](https://openaccountants.com) may be ahead of what you cloned. (When a professional catches drift, it lands here as a public correction, like [PR #45](https://github.com/openaccountants/openaccountants/pull/45).)
- **Coverage is uneven.** 13 countries have the full accounting suite; many jurisdictions have VAT only or partial coverage. Check each country folder's README or [`index.json`](index.json).
- **Newer domains need more eyes.** Bookkeeping, payroll, formation, and financial statements Guides are source-cited drafts with fewer Partner reviews than the core tax Guides.

## Disclaimer

OpenAccountants provides general tax and accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It is **not** a law firm, accounting firm, tax preparer, or return-filing service. Outputs are **not** tax, legal, accounting, or financial advice, are not reviewed for your specific facts, and must be reviewed by a qualified professional before filing, payment, or action. Using a Guide does not create a client relationship. A *source-cited draft* has not been reviewed by a credentialed accountant; only an *accountant-reviewed* Guide carries a Partner's review, and that review is of reference material, not of any specific taxpayer's situation.

The most up-to-date, reviewed version is maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://openaccountants.com).
