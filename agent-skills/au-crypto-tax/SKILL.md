## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Australia (Commonwealth of Australia) |
| Tax | Income Tax -- Cryptocurrency / Digital Assets |
| Currency | AUD (all gains/income must be reported in AUD) |
| Tax year | 1 July 2024 -- 30 June 2025 |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, Div 104 (CGT events), Div 118 (exemptions) |
| Supporting guidance | ATO Cryptocurrency guidance (updated 2024); TD 2014/26 (Bitcoin as CGT asset); PCG 2023/1 (DeFi) |
| Tax authority | Australian Taxation Office (ATO) |
| Filing portal | myTax / tax agent lodgement |
| Filing deadline | 31 October (self-lodgement); agent-managed deadlines vary |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Core Principle

The ATO treats cryptocurrency (including Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, NFTs, and DeFi tokens) as a **CGT asset**, not as foreign currency. Each disposal triggers a CGT event.

### Individual Marginal Tax Rates (2024-25)

| Taxable Income (AUD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 18,200 | 0% |
| 18,201 -- 45,000 | 16% |
| 45,001 -- 135,000 | 30% |
| 135,001 -- 190,000 | 37% |
| 190,001+ | 45% |

### Key Thresholds

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Personal use asset exemption | Acquisition cost < $10,000 |
| CGT discount (held 12+ months) | 50% for individuals and trusts |
| CGT discount -- companies | Not available |
| Capital loss carry forward | Indefinite (offset against future capital gains only) |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown acquisition date | No 50% discount available |
| Unknown cost base | $0 (maximum gain) -- obtain records |
| Unknown whether personal use or investment | Treat as investment (CGT applies) |
| Unknown whether trading or investing | Treat as investor (CGT, not ordinary income) |
| DeFi event -- unknown character | Treat as disposal (CGT event) |

---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 CGT Events (Disposals)

A CGT event occurs when you:

| Event | CGT Triggered? |
|---|---|
| Sell crypto for AUD (or fiat) | Yes |
| Trade one crypto for another (e.g., BTC → ETH) | Yes -- disposal of BTC at market value |
| Use crypto to purchase goods/services | Yes -- disposal at market value |
| Gift crypto to another person | Yes -- market value at time of gift |
| Send crypto to an exchange for sale | No (transfer to own wallet is not disposal) |
| Transfer between own wallets | No -- same beneficial ownership |
| Lost/stolen crypto (no private key) | Possible CGT event -- must demonstrate irrecoverability |

### 2.2 Cost Base Calculation

| Element | Included in Cost Base |
|---|---|
| Purchase price in AUD | Yes |
| Exchange fees / commission on acquisition | Yes |
| Gas fees on acquisition transaction | Yes |
| Exchange fees / commission on disposal | Reduces capital proceeds (or included in cost base of new asset in swap) |
| Wallet transfer fees (own wallets) | Included in cost base of the asset |
| Subscription to portfolio tracking tool | Included (third element -- ownership costs) |

**Method for identical assets:** FIFO, LIFO, or specific identification -- must be consistent and documented. ATO does not mandate a method but requires consistency.

### 2.3 50% CGT Discount

Available if:
- The asset was held for at least 12 months (acquisition to disposal)
- The taxpayer is an individual or trust (not a company or super fund at 1/3 discount)
- The taxpayer is an Australian tax resident at the time of the CGT event

### 2.4 Personal Use Asset Exemption

| Condition | All Must Be Met |
|---|---|
| Acquired for personal use (e.g., to purchase goods) | Yes |
| Acquisition cost < $10,000 | Yes |
| Used within a short time of acquisition | Yes |
| NOT held as an investment | Yes |
| NOT held for exchange/trading purposes | Yes |

If ANY acquisition cost ≥ $10,000, the personal use asset exemption does NOT apply. If crypto is kept on an exchange or held for extended periods, the ATO considers it an investment -- NOT personal use.

### 2.5 Trading vs Investing

| Factor | Investor (CGT) | Trader (Business Income) |
|---|---|---|
| Volume of transactions | Low to moderate | High frequency, systematic |
| Holding period | Weeks/months/years | Minutes/hours/days |
| Purpose | Long-term growth | Profit from short-term price movements |
| Organisation | Casual / part-time | Business-like, significant time commitment |
| Capital employed | Personal savings | Significant working capital |
| Tax treatment | Capital gains (50% discount available) | Ordinary income (no CGT discount, no capital loss restrictions) |
| Losses | Capital losses only | Business losses (offset all income) |

### 2.6 Staking Rewards

| Treatment | Detail |
|---|---|
| Classification | Ordinary income at market value when received |
| Timing | Assessable in the income year the reward is received/controlled |
| Cost base for future CGT | Market value at date of receipt becomes cost base |
| Holding period for CGT discount | Starts from date of receipt |

### 2.7 Airdrops

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop with no action required | Ordinary income at market value on receipt (if established market value exists) |
| Airdrop requiring action (e.g., claim transaction) | Ordinary income when claimed |
| Airdrop of worthless/no-market token | $0 income; cost base = $0 |
| Subsequent disposal | CGT event -- cost base is value at receipt |

### 2.8 DeFi Specific Events

| DeFi Action | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Wrapping (e.g., ETH → WETH) | ATO view: likely a disposal (CGT event). Conservative: treat as disposal at market value |
| Unwrapping (WETH → ETH) | Disposal of WETH, acquisition of ETH |
| Providing liquidity (LP tokens) | Disposal of deposited tokens; acquisition of LP token at combined market value |
| Removing liquidity | Disposal of LP token; acquisition of underlying tokens |
| Yield farming rewards | Ordinary income at market value when received |
| Borrowing against crypto (collateral) | Not a disposal (no change of beneficial ownership). BUT if liquidated -- CGT event |
| Bridge transactions (cross-chain) | Conservative: treat as disposal + acquisition |
| Token migration/hard fork | New token acquired at $0 cost base; not assessable until disposed |

### 2.9 NFTs

Treated identically to other crypto assets. Purchase = acquisition (CGT asset). Sale = disposal (CGT event). Creating and selling an NFT = ordinary income if in the business of creating them, otherwise CGT.

| LP WITHDRAWAL (REMOVE LIQUIDITY) | Disposal of LP token, acquisition of tokens | |
| CLAIM REWARDS | Ordinary income | Market value at time of claim |
| BRIDGE [TOKEN] TO [CHAIN] | Conservative: disposal + acquisition | |
| MINT NFT | Acquisition | Cost base = mint price + gas |
| APPROVE / REVOKE (no transfer) | Not a CGT event | Gas fee adds to cost of next related transaction |

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Identify All CGT Events
List every disposal in the financial year (sells, swaps, spends, gifts, DeFi events).

### Step 2: Calculate Gain/Loss per Event
Capital proceeds − cost base = capital gain (or capital loss).

### Step 3: Apply 50% Discount (if eligible)
For each gain where asset held ≥ 12 months: net capital gain = gain × 50%.

### Step 4: Offset Capital Losses
Apply current and prior year capital losses against gross capital gains BEFORE applying the 50% discount.

**Correct order:** Gross gains − capital losses = net gain. Then apply 50% discount to remaining gains eligible.

### Step 5: Add Ordinary Income
Staking rewards + airdrops + mining income reported as other income (not in CGT schedule).

### Step 6: Report on Tax Return
- Capital gains: Item 18 (Capital gains)
- Ordinary crypto income: Item 24 (Other income)

## Section 5 -- Record-Keeping Requirements

The ATO requires the following records for each transaction:

| Record | Required |
|---|---|
| Date of acquisition | Yes |
| Date of disposal | Yes |
| Amount in AUD at time of transaction | Yes |
| Purpose of the transaction | Yes |
| Exchange/wallet records | Yes |
| Counterparty details (if applicable) | Yes |
| Exchange rate used (AUD conversion) | Yes |
| Agent/exchange fees | Yes |

Retention period: 5 years from the date of lodgement of the return in which the gain/loss is reported. For assets still held: records must be kept until 5 years after eventual disposal.

---

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Hard Forks

Tokens received from a hard fork (e.g., Bitcoin Cash from Bitcoin) have a cost base of $0. No income at receipt. CGT event occurs on subsequent disposal with cost base = $0.

### 6.2 Lost or Stolen Crypto

A capital loss may be claimed if the crypto is demonstrably lost (e.g., lost private keys with no possibility of recovery, scam/hack with no recovery). The taxpayer must demonstrate the loss is permanent. ATO may require evidence.

### 6.3 Mining

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Hobby miner (small scale) | Mined coins acquired at $0 cost base; CGT on disposal |
| Business miner (significant scale) | Ordinary income at market value when mined; trading stock rules may apply |

### 6.4 Crypto Received as Payment for Services

Assessable as ordinary income (PSI or business income) at market value in AUD at time of receipt. Cost base for future CGT = that market value.

### 6.5 Margin Trading / Futures

Profits and losses from crypto derivatives and margin trading are generally on revenue account (ordinary income/loss) unless clearly a one-off speculative punt.

---

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER claim the personal use asset exemption for crypto held on an exchange for extended periods
- NEVER apply the 50% CGT discount without verifying 12+ months holding period
- NEVER apply the 50% CGT discount for companies or non-residents
- NEVER offset capital losses against ordinary income (only against capital gains)
- NEVER apply capital losses before gross gains (apply losses first, THEN discount)
- NEVER ignore crypto-to-crypto swaps as non-events -- each swap is a disposal
- NEVER assume DeFi events are non-taxable -- conservative approach is to treat as disposals
- NEVER omit staking/airdrop income -- it is ordinary income when received
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
