## Section 2 -- How Alaska sales tax actually works

Alaska is one of five U.S. states with **no statewide sales tax** (the others
are Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon). It is also one of the states
with **no individual income tax**. For a sole proprietor, that means:

- **Income side:** federal return only. There is no Alaska personal income tax
  return. The Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD) is taxable on the **federal**
  return but has no Alaska income-tax consequence.
- **Sales side:** there is no state sales tax, but **local jurisdictions
  (boroughs and incorporated cities) may levy their own sales tax.** Some large
  areas levy none (e.g., the Municipality of Anchorage and Fairbanks city have
  no general sales tax), while many smaller communities do (e.g., Juneau,
  Sitka, Kodiak, Nome, Wasilla, Kenai).

There is therefore no single "Alaska rate." The rate, base, exemptions, and
filing cadence are set by **each municipality**.

## Section 3 -- Two collection regimes

1. **In-state sellers (physical presence in a municipality).** Register
   **directly with the local municipality** where you have a physical location
   and collect that municipality's tax under its local code.

2. **Remote sellers (no physical presence).** Register **once** with the
   **Alaska Remote Seller Sales Tax Commission (ARSSTC)**, which administers a
   single Uniform Code on behalf of participating municipalities. File one
   consolidated return through the ARSSTC portal; tax is sourced to the buyer's
   delivery location (destination-based) using each member jurisdiction's rate
   and exemptions.

## Section 4 -- Economic nexus (remote sellers)

- A remote seller must register and collect once it has **$100,000 in statewide
  gross sales** delivered into Alaska in the current or previous calendar year.
- The former **200-transaction** prong was **eliminated effective January 1,
  2025** -- the dollar threshold is now the only test.
- The threshold is measured against **statewide** sales into all Alaska
  jurisdictions combined, not per-municipality.
- **Marketplace facilitators** (Amazon, Etsy, etc.) collect and remit for their
  third-party sellers; sales made through a registered marketplace generally do
  not create a separate registration duty for the seller, but still count toward
  the seller's threshold measurement.

## Section 5 -- Transaction pattern library

Because the base is set locally, treat the following as **defaults to verify
against the specific municipality's code**:

| Pattern | Typical treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| General tangible goods | TAXABLE at local rate | Only where a local tax exists |
| Grocery / unprepared food | Often EXEMPT | Many municipalities exempt; some do not |
| Professional services | Often TAXABLE | Several Alaska municipalities tax services |
| SaaS / digital goods | Verify locally | Treatment varies by municipality |
| Resale | EXEMPT with certificate | Per local code |
| Sales above a price cap | Partially exempt | Some municipalities cap taxable amount per sale |

## Section 10 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER assume a single statewide Alaska sales-tax rate -- there is none.
- NEVER assume "no sales tax in Alaska" for a remote seller -- local tax applies
  via ARSSTC once the $100,000 threshold is met.
- NEVER apply the 200-transaction test for periods on or after January 1, 2025.
- NEVER compute any number; confirm the rate and base with the specific
  municipality or the ARSSTC member-rate table.

## Disclaimer

This skill and its outputs are provided for informational and computational

Alaska sales-tax rules are set by individual municipalities and change
frequently; always confirm the current rate, base, and filing rules with the
relevant borough or city, or with ARSSTC for remote sellers. All outputs must be
