## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rates (TY 2025)

**Single, Head of Family, and Married Filing Separately:**

| Taxable income | Rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $500 | 2% |
| $501 – $3,000 | 4% |
| Over $3,000 | 5% |

**Married Filing Jointly:**

| Taxable income | Rate |
|---|---|
| $0 – $1,000 | 2% |
| $1,001 – $6,000 | 4% |
| Over $6,000 | 5% |

### Personal exemptions

| Filing status | Exemption |
|---|---|
| Single | $1,500 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $3,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $1,500 |
| Head of Family | $3,000 |
| Dependent exemption | $300 per dependent (min, higher amounts per statute) |

### Standard deduction

Alabama does **not** use a fixed standard deduction amount. The allowable standard deduction is determined from the Standard Deduction Chart published by ADOR, which varies by filing status and Alabama Adjusted Gross Income. Taxpayers must consult the chart in the Form 40 instruction booklet.

**Key feature:** Alabama is one of only three states that allows a deduction for **federal income taxes paid** from state taxable income.

---

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

1. **Starting point:** Alabama begins with **federal adjusted gross income** (federal Form 1040, Line 11).
2. **Alabama additions:** Add back any income excluded federally but taxable in Alabama (e.g., certain interest income from other states' obligations).
3. **Alabama subtractions:** Subtract Alabama-exempt income (e.g., Social Security benefits, certain retirement income, interest on U.S. obligations).
4. **Federal income tax deduction:** Deduct federal income taxes actually paid (or accrued) during the tax year. This is a significant benefit unique to Alabama.
5. **Standard deduction or itemized:** Apply the standard deduction (from chart) or Alabama itemized deductions.
6. **Personal exemption:** Subtract the personal exemption amount.
7. **Result:** Alabama taxable income → apply graduated rates.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity
- Alabama generally conforms to federal IRC for computing income, including Schedule C business deductions.
- The QBI deduction (§199A) is a **federal** deduction that reduces federal tax paid, thereby indirectly reducing the Alabama federal tax deduction — but it does not directly affect Alabama taxable income computation.

### SE health insurance deduction
- Alabama follows the federal deduction for self-employed health insurance premiums (above-the-line on federal return), which flows through to AL AGI.

### Retirement contributions
- SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI and therefore reduce Alabama starting income.

### Home office deduction
- Federal home office deduction (simplified or actual) flows through Schedule C and is reflected in federal AGI.

### Estimated tax payments (Form 40-ES)
- **Threshold:** Must pay estimated tax if you expect to owe ≥ $500 after withholding and credits.
- **Safe harbor:** Pay the lesser of 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax.
- **Due dates:** April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
- **Payment methods:** Mail (Form 40-ES voucher to P.O. Box 327485, Montgomery, AL 36132-7485) or electronically via My Alabama Taxes portal.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| # | Rule | Why judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| T2-01 | Standard deduction vs. itemized | Taxpayer must compare both methods; chart-based standard deduction varies by income level |
| T2-02 | Federal tax deduction — paid vs. accrued method | Choice of method affects timing and amount |
| T2-03 | Allocation of income for part-year residents | Requires analysis of residency dates and income sourcing |
| T2-04 | Business vs. hobby determination | Same federal analysis, but affects AL Schedule C flow-through |
| T2-05 | Multistate income allocation | If taxpayer has income from other states, credit for taxes paid elsewhere (Schedule CR) |
