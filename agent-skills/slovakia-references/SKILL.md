## Priznanie Digital

- Repository: [priznanie-digital/priznanie-digital](https://github.com/priznanie-digital/priznanie-digital)
- License: MIT
- Stars: 18
- Contributors: 40
- Language: Slovak / English
- Scope: Full DPFO typ B (Daň z príjmov fyzickej osoby — personal income tax return, type B for self-employed) web application for Slovak freelancers (SZČO — samostatne zárobkovo činná osoba). Supports paušálne výdavky (flat-rate expenses), nezdaniteľné časti základu dane (non-taxable amounts), daňový bonus na dieťa (child tax bonus), and generates XML for electronic filing via slovensko.sk.
- Why it matters: Active project (last push April 2026) with 40 contributors, which is exceptional community involvement for a country-specific tax tool. MIT-licensed and covers the most common freelancer filing scenario in Slovakia.
- Integration approach:
  - MIT is fully compatible. Tax computation logic, deduction rules, and XML generation patterns directly usable.
  - Strong reference for Slovak DPFO typ B calculations, SZČO social/health insurance contributions, paušálne výdavky percentages, and slovensko.sk electronic filing format.
  - The large contributor base suggests the calculations are well-tested against real returns.
