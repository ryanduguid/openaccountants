- Scope: Bangladesh personal income tax calculator implementing NBR tax slabs, salary component exemptions (house rent 50% capped, medical 10% capped, conveyance), investment rebate calculation (tiered 15%/12%/10% based on income level), and taxpayer category-based thresholds (male, female, 65+, specially-abled, freedom fighter).
