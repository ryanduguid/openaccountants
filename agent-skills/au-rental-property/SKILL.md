## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Rental Income

All gross rental income is assessable. Report at Item 21 (Rent) on the Individual Tax Return.

| Income Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Rent received from tenant | Assessable -- full amount received or receivable |
| Bond forfeited (retained for damage) | Assessable in year retained |
| Insurance payout (loss of rent) | Assessable |
| Reimbursement from tenant (excess utilities) | Assessable |
| Key money / lease premium | Assessable |

### 2.2 Negative Gearing

Where total deductions exceed gross rental income, the net rental loss reduces other assessable income (salary, business income). There is no cap on negative gearing for existing or new properties (as of 2025 law).

### 2.3 Deductible Expenses (Immediate)

| Expense | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Interest on investment loan | Deductible | Must trace loan purpose to rental property |
| Council rates | Deductible | Apportioned if part-private |
| Water rates / charges | Deductible | |
| Body corporate / strata fees | Deductible | Includes admin fund and sinking fund contributions |
| Land tax | Deductible | |
| Property management fees | Deductible | Agent commissions, letting fees |
| Insurance (landlord, building, contents) | Deductible | |
| Advertising for tenants | Deductible | |
| Pest control | Deductible | |
| Gardening / lawn mowing (if provided to tenant) | Deductible | |
| Tax agent fee (rental schedule portion) | Deductible | |
| Travel to property (removed from 1 Jul 2017) | NOT deductible | Unless carrying on a rental property business |

### 2.4 Repairs vs Improvements (TR 97/23)

| Characteristic | Repair (immediate deduction) | Improvement (capitalise) |
|---|---|---|
| Restores to original condition | Yes | No |
| Replaces with substantially same materials | Yes | No -- better quality/different character |
| Initial repair on acquisition | NOT deductible (capital) | Capital -- add to cost base |
| Replaces entire structure (e.g. full roof) | Capital (replacement) | Capital |
| Example: patching cracked tiles | Repair | -- |
| Example: replacing all tiles with stone | -- | Improvement |
| Example: replacing broken tap with same model | Repair | -- |
| Example: full kitchen renovation | -- | Improvement |

### 2.5 Division 40 -- Plant & Equipment Depreciation

Applies to removable/mechanical assets within the property.

| Asset | Effective Life (ATO) | Decline Method |
|---|---|---|
| Hot water system | 12 years | Diminishing value or prime cost |
| Carpet | 8 years | Either |
| Blinds / curtains | 8 years | Either |
| Oven / cooktop | 12 years | Either |
| Air conditioning (split system) | 10 years | Either |
| Dishwasher | 8 years | Either |
| Smoke alarm | 6 years | Either |
| Ceiling fan | 10 years | Either |

**Diminishing value rate:** 200% ÷ effective life
**Prime cost rate:** 100% ÷ effective life

**Limitation (from 1 Jul 2017):** For residential rental properties, only the first owner (or entity that had the asset newly installed) can claim Div 40 deductions. Subsequent owners cannot claim plant & equipment depreciation on existing assets -- they inherit zero depreciable value for previously used items (unless an exception applies, e.g., refurbishment by new owner).

### 2.6 Division 43 -- Capital Works Deduction

Applies to the structural elements (building itself, fixed improvements).

| Construction Date | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Before 18 July 1985 | 0% | No deduction available |
| 18 Jul 1985 -- 15 Sep 1987 | 4% | Residential/non-residential |
| After 15 Sep 1987 (residential) | 2.5% | 40-year write-off |
| After 15 Sep 1987 (short-term traveller) | 4% | Certain accommodation |

**Base:** Original construction cost (obtain from quantity surveyor report or builder records). NOT the purchase price of the property.

**Undeducted construction cost** passes to new owner on sale -- the new owner continues the 2.5% deduction on the remaining undeducted amount.

### 2.7 Interest Deductibility

The loan must have a clear nexus to producing rental income. Key rules:

| Scenario | Deductible? |
|---|---|
| Loan to purchase rental property | Yes -- full interest |
| Loan to renovate rental property | Yes -- full interest |
| Refinanced loan (same purpose, same or lower amount) | Yes |
| Loan redrawn for personal use | No -- apportioned |
| Line of credit (mixed purpose) | Must trace each drawdown |
| Interest on loan while property vacant (available for rent) | Yes |
| Interest during construction period | Deductible from date available for rent (or capitalised to cost base) |

### 2.8 CGT on Disposal

| Element | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Cost base | Purchase price + stamp duty + legal fees + capital improvements - Div 43 deductions claimed |
| Capital proceeds | Sale price - agent commission - legal fees on sale |
| Net capital gain | Proceeds - cost base |
| 50% CGT discount | Available if held 12+ months (individuals/trusts only) |
| Main residence exemption (partial) | Available if property was main residence for part of ownership period |
| 6-year absence rule | Treat as main residence for up to 6 years of absence if no other main residence claimed |
| Non-residents | No 50% discount (from 8 May 2012 for gains accruing after that date) |

### 2.9 Non-Resident Rental Withholding

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Applies to | Non-resident landlords receiving Australian rental income |
| Rate | Payer (tenant/agent) must withhold amounts as directed by ATO |
| FRCGW (foreign resident CGT withholding) | 12.5% of sale price if property value ≥ $750,000 (buyer withholds) |
| Clearance certificate | Resident vendor obtains to avoid FRCGW at settlement |

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Gross Rental Income
Sum all assessable rental receipts for the financial year.

### Step 2: Immediate Deductions
Sum all allowable expenses (interest, rates, insurance, management fees, repairs, body corporate, etc.).

### Step 3: Depreciation (Div 40 + Div 43)
Add capital works deduction (2.5% of construction cost) and plant depreciation (per ATO effective life schedules).

### Step 4: Net Rental Income / Loss
Gross income − deductions − depreciation = net rental income (or loss if negative gearing).

### Step 5: Report on Tax Return
Positive: included in assessable income and taxed at marginal rates.
Negative: offsets other assessable income (salary, business) dollar-for-dollar.

## Section 5 -- Filing Requirements

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Form | Individual Tax Return (ITR) -- Rental Property Schedule (Item 21) |
| Reporting | Per-property basis (complete separate schedule for each property) |
| Joint ownership | Each co-owner reports their share (typically 50/50 for joint tenants) |
| Records retention | 5 years from date of lodgement (longer if CGT applies -- keep until 5 years after disposal) |
| Quantity surveyor report | Recommended for all post-1985 properties to substantiate Div 43 and Div 40 claims |

---

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Property Vacant

Expenses are deductible during vacancy ONLY if the property is genuinely available for rent (advertised, not restricted in availability). If withheld from the market (e.g., reserved for personal use or holiday), deductions are denied for that period.

### 6.2 Part-Year Rental / Part-Private Use

Apportion all expenses on a time basis (days rented or available ÷ 365). Interest remains fully deductible if the property was available for the full year even if vacant.

### 6.3 Holiday Homes

If the property is available for rent at below-market rates, or restricted to holiday periods only, or rented to relatives at reduced rates -- deductions are limited to income received (no negative gearing). ATO scrutinises holiday letting closely.

### 6.4 Subdivision and Development

If a rental property is subdivided, the profit on sale of subdivided lots may be ordinary income (not CGT) if the taxpayer has a profit-making intention. Escalate to specialist.

### 6.5 Deceased Estates

Rental property passing through an estate: the legal personal representative (LPR) reports rental income in the estate return until the property is transferred to a beneficiary. CGT is deferred until the beneficiary disposes.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER claim travel to a residential rental property as a deduction (removed from 1 July 2017 for non-business landlords)
- NEVER claim Div 40 plant depreciation for a subsequent owner of residential property (post-2017 rule) unless the asset was newly installed by that owner
- NEVER claim Div 43 without evidence of construction cost (quantity surveyor report or original builder records)
- NEVER deduct loan principal repayments
- NEVER deduct expenses relating to periods of genuine private use without apportionment
- NEVER claim the CGT 50% discount for a non-resident individual
- NEVER omit prior Div 43 deductions from the cost base on disposal (reduces cost base)
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
