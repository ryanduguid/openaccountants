## Special treatment: India Equalisation Levy 2.0

**[T1] Indian payors must withhold 6% Equalisation Levy** on payments for online advertising services to non-residents (Finance Act 2016 §165). Failure leads to disallowance under §40(a)(ib) ITA.

The Indian advertiser:
1. Withholds 6% from payment
2. Remits to Income Tax Department
3. Reports annually in Form 1
4. Discloses on income tax return for §40(a)(ib) deduction allowance

See `digital-services-tax-matrix.md` for full DST treatment.

## EU place of supply (B2B advertising)

**[T1]** Article 44 PVD: B2B services taxed where customer established → reverse charge for cross-border B2B. Article 59a may shift to country of effective use/enjoyment for some non-EU customer cases — confirm.

---

## Default classification

- **Schedule C**: Line 8 — Advertising
- **UK self-employment**: Box 14 (Advertising and entertainment)
- **EU bookkeeping**: "Werbung und Marketing" / "Publicité"

---

## Self-checks

- [ ] Indian EL withheld where applicable (Indian payor → non-resident provider)
- [ ] EU/UK B2B reverse charge applied
- [ ] Currency conversion at payment date
