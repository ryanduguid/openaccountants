## Section 1 — Marketplaces (seller-side classification)

For a freelancer or e-commerce seller, marketplace transactions involve gross sales, fees, and platform-collected sales tax / VAT. Bank statements show only the net deposit.

| **Amazon Seller** | `AMAZON SELLER`, `AMAZON PAYMENTS`, `AMAZON SERVICES EUROPE`, `AMAZON MKTPLACE PMTS` | Referral fee 6-45% by category; FBA fees; ad fees | Amazon collects "marketplace tax" in US states; EU/UK deemed-supplier for imports ≤ EUR/£150 |

### 1.2 Marketplace facilitator US sales tax

**[T1]** Most US states (45+) require marketplaces above thresholds (typically $100k sales or 200 transactions) to collect and remit state sales tax on behalf of third-party sellers. Sellers report gross sales to marketplace but don't have independent sales tax obligation in those states for marketplace-facilitated transactions.

### 1.3 EU marketplace deemed-supplier

**[T1]** From 1 July 2021, EU Marketplace Deemed Supplier rules:
- Distance sales of goods imported into EU ≤ EUR 150: marketplace deemed supplier (IOSS scheme)
- B2C goods supply from a third country by a non-EU seller via marketplace: marketplace deemed supplier
- Domestic B2C sales by non-EU seller via marketplace into EU consumer: marketplace deemed supplier

### 1.4 Form 1099-K thresholds (US)

**[T1]** Reduced under American Rescue Plan to USD 600 from 2022; transition relief delayed:
- 2024: USD 5,000 threshold
- 2025: USD 2,500
- 2026 onwards: USD 600 (confirmed by OBBBA P.L. 119-21 July 2025)

Form 1099-K is reported by third-party settlement organisations (Stripe, PayPal, marketplaces).

### 1.5 EU DAC7 platform reporting

**[T1]** Council Directive (EU) 2021/514 requires reporting platforms to provide data on sellers' transactions to tax authorities. Effective 1 January 2023 for reporting 2024. Coordinates with OECD Model Rules for Reporting by Digital Platform Operators.

### 1.6 UK Online Sales Tax / Platform Reporting

**[T1]** UK has implemented OECD model rules from 1 January 2024 for platforms with sellers of goods, services, accommodation, transport. Platforms must report seller data to HMRC.

## Section 2 — Banking and payment fees

### 2.1 Recurring fee patterns

| Pattern | Bank statement variations | Default category |
|---|---|---|
| **Wire fee** | `WIRE FEE`, `OUTGOING WIRE`, `INTERNATIONAL WIRE` | Bank charges / Other expenses |
| **Currency conversion fee** | `FX FEE`, `FOREIGN EXCH FEE`, `CURRENCY CONVERSION`, `0.5% INTL FEE` | Bank charges / Currency loss |
| **ATM fee** | `ATM FEE`, `OUT-OF-NETWORK ATM`, `INTERAC FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Monthly account fee** | `MONTHLY FEE`, `ACCT MAINT FEE`, `BANK ACCOUNT FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Overdraft fee** | `OVERDRAFT FEE`, `NSF FEE`, `INSUFFICIENT FUNDS` | Bank charges (note: deductibility may be restricted by purpose) |
| **Returned cheque fee** | `RETURNED CHK FEE`, `RETURNED ITEM FEE` | Bank charges |
| **PayPal sending fee** | `PAYPAL *FEE`, `PYPL FEE` | Bank charges / Payment processing |
| **Stripe transaction fee** | `STRIPE FEE`, `STRIPE *PROCESSING` | Bank charges / Payment processing |
| **Card swap / replacement** | `CARD REPLACEMENT`, `NEW CARD FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Wire receive fee** | `WIRE RECEIVED FEE`, `INTL WIRE IN FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Inactivity fee** | `INACTIVITY FEE`, `DORMANT ACCOUNT FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Foreign transaction fee (card)** | `FOREIGN TRANSACTION FEE`, `3% FX` | Bank charges / Currency loss |
| **SWIFT fee** | `SWIFT FEE`, `SWIFT MSG FEE` | Bank charges |
| **Verified by Visa** | `VBV FEE` | Bank charges |

### 2.2 Currency conversion accounting

**[T1]** Multi-currency transactions create FX gain/loss:
- IFRS: IAS 21 — settle at spot rate at transaction; revalue monetary items at closing rate
- US GAAP: ASC 830 — same principle

Bank-imposed FX spreads (e.g., 0.5% above interbank) are typically classified as bank charges, not FX loss. Strict accountants reclassify as a finance cost.

### 2.3 VAT on bank fees

**[T1]** Most bank fees are exempt from VAT under "financial services" exemption (Article 135 PVD; IRC ITA s.135; etc.). Specific advisory or non-financial services from a bank may be taxable.
