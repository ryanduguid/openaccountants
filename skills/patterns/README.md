## How to use

Pattern files are loaded automatically by country packages. They make classification faster: instead of asking "what is `STRIPE PAYMENTS UK LTD`?" the AI already knows it's a payment processor and classifies the fee correctly.

If you find a vendor missing or misclassified, that's the easiest contribution to make — submit a PR with the vendor name, the bank-statement variations you've seen, and the correct default classification.

See [START-HERE.md](../../START-HERE.md) for persona-based routing.
