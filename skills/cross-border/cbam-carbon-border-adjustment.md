description: >
  Use this skill whenever an EU importer (declarant), an indirect customs representative, or a non-EU producer asks about the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Trigger on phrases like "CBAM", "carbon border adjustment", "CBAM certificates", "embedded emissions", "default values", "verified emissions", "CN code 7208", "CN code 28080000", "fertiliser CBAM", "cement CBAM", "aluminium CBAM", "hydrogen CBAM", "electricity CBAM", "iron and steel CBAM", "quarterly CBAM report", "CBAM declarant", "CBAM authorised declarant", or any request to assess CBAM scope, compute embedded emissions, prepare the quarterly report (transitional period) or annual CBAM declaration (definitive period from 2026). Covers Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 (transitional period reporting), the Default Values Implementing Regulation and the Commission's 2025 sectoral guidance. Does NOT cover: emissions trading system (EU ETS), domestic carbon taxes (UK CBAM, Australia Safeguard Mechanism, California CCA), customs tariff / preference rules, or product origin determination. ALWAYS read this skill before computing CBAM exposure or preparing a CBAM report.

# EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `cross-border-workflow-base`.** It implements:

- **Regulation (EU) 2023/956** of 10 May 2023 establishing the CBAM.
- **Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773** of 17 August 2023 on reporting obligations during the transitional period (1 October 2023 – 31 December 2025).
- **Definitive period rules** entering into force 1 January 2026 (financial liability via CBAM certificates plus annual CBAM declaration).
- **Default values** and verified-emissions methodologies as published by the Commission.

**Tax year coverage.** Current for **calendar 2025** (transitional reporting) and the **early definitive period 2026**, reflecting the **Omnibus simplification proposal of February 2025** which introduced a small-importer de minimis (50 tonnes/year per declarant) and clarified default-value usage.

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** CBAM emissions data flows from production-site engineering records, customs classifications, and external verification. Every output must be reviewed by a credentialed practitioner (customs broker, EU import lawyer, or accredited verifier under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067) before submission.

## Section 3 — Filing requirements

### Transitional period (to 31 December 2025)

**[T1] Reporting declarant** (importer or indirect customs representative) submits a **quarterly CBAM report** within **one month** of quarter end via the CBAM Transitional Registry.

Contents per Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773:
- Total quantity of CBAM goods imported (by CN code and country of origin)
- Total embedded emissions (direct and where applicable indirect) in tonnes CO₂e per tonne of goods
- Methodology used (verified actual data; default values from the Commission; equivalent national methodologies during a grace period)
- Carbon price paid in the country of production with supporting documentation

**Transitional period flexibility:**
- Q3 2023 → Q3 2024: any methodology, including default values, allowed.
- From Q4 2024 onwards: must use actual values where available; default values only allowed within Commission-set limits.

### Definitive period (from 1 January 2026)

**[T1] Only an Authorised CBAM Declarant** can import CBAM goods.

Application via the national Competent Authority of the importer's Member State. Approval requires:
- No serious or repeated infringements of customs, tax, or market abuse rules
- Financial standing
- Established in the Member State

**Annual CBAM declaration** due 31 May for the prior calendar year, containing:
- Total quantity imported per CN code per country of origin
- Total embedded emissions (verified by accredited verifier, except where default values used)
- Total CBAM certificates to be surrendered
- Carbon price paid in country of origin

**Certificate purchase**: declarant buys CBAM certificates at the weekly average price of EU ETS auctions, on the Common Central Platform managed by a designated entity (likely the European Energy Exchange).

**Certificate surrender**: equal to embedded emissions × applicable factor (reflecting any ETS free allocation phasing — Article 31 / Annex II).

---

## Section 4 — Computing embedded emissions

### Step 1 — Classify the import

**[T1] Match the goods to a CN (Combined Nomenclature) code.** CBAM scope is determined by Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2023/956 — a list of specific 4-/6-/8-digit CN codes. If the CN code is not in Annex I, the import is out of scope (this period).

### Step 2 — Determine the country of origin

**[T1]** Use customs rules of origin. CBAM applies to imports from third countries EXCEPT:
- EEA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway)
- Switzerland
- Certain territories with full EU ETS coverage (Northern Ireland for electricity, Büsingen, etc. — Annex III)

### Step 3 — Identify the production installation

**[T1]** Embedded emissions are computed at the installation level. Importer must obtain from the third-country operator:
- Installation identification (name, address, UNLOCODE if available, operator name)
- Direct emissions: Specific Direct Embedded Emissions (SDEE) per tonne of product
- Indirect emissions (electricity used in production) — applicable currently for cement, fertilisers, electricity, hydrogen; **not** applicable for iron and steel or aluminium during the transitional period and currently in the definitive period (confirm latest delegated act)
- Production route (e.g., for steel: integrated route via BOF vs electric arc furnace)
- Carbon price paid (per Article 9)

### Step 4 — Methodology selection

**[T1] Hierarchy (Annex IV):**

1. **Actual emissions data** from the installation, calculated per the EU methodology equivalent to ETS Monitoring and Reporting Regulation (EU) 2018/2066, verified by an accredited verifier.
2. **Default values** — Commission-published per sector and country/region. Use only:
   - During transitional period freely until end of Q3 2024
   - From Q4 2024: only for ≤ 20% of imported product weight per declarant per quarter
   - In definitive period: only where actual values cannot reasonably be obtained
3. **Other methodologies** — equivalent national methodologies of the producing country may be accepted during transitional period; not generally in definitive period.

### Step 5 — Compute embedded emissions

**[T1]** For each shipment:

```
Embedded Emissions (tCO₂e) = Quantity (t) × Specific Embedded Emissions (tCO₂e / t)
```

Sum across all shipments for the reporting period.

### Step 6 — Adjustment for carbon price paid

**[T1]** Article 9 allows a deduction for carbon price paid in country of origin on the embedded emissions of the imported goods, provided:
- The price was effectively paid (e.g., national ETS, carbon tax)
- Documentation provided (proof of payment, accreditation of the carbon-pricing regime)
- Not offset by subsidies or other rebates

Adjustment in EUR converted at exchange rate of payment date.

### Step 7 — Compute certificate surrender (definitive period from 2026)

```
Certificates to surrender = Embedded Emissions − Free Allocation Factor − Carbon Price Adjustment
```

**Free Allocation Factor (Annex II):** in 2026 = 97.5% of the free allocation share for the equivalent ETS product (i.e., importer surrenders only 2.5% × benchmark emissions); reduces annually to 0% in 2034.

Each certificate represents 1 tCO₂e and is purchased at the weekly average EU ETS auction price.

## Section 5 — Edge cases and special rules

### 5.1 Indirect emissions

Currently in scope for: cement, fertilisers, electricity, hydrogen.
Out of scope (transitional + early definitive period) for: iron and steel, aluminium.
The Commission's 2025 review will reassess scope inclusion.

### 5.2 De minimis exemption (Article 2(3) and Omnibus 2025)

**[T1]** Originally: shipments ≤ EUR 150 in value exempt.
**Omnibus 2025 (proposed):** 50-tonne annual de minimis per importer. Confirm the as-enacted text before relying.

### 5.3 Re-imports of EU-originating goods

Goods of EU origin that are re-imported are out of scope.

### 5.4 Inward processing and special procedures

Goods placed under inward processing, customs warehousing, transit, or other suspensive procedures are generally not yet released for free circulation and do not trigger CBAM. CBAM triggers on release for free circulation.

### 5.5 Precursor materials

For complex goods (e.g., steel articles, aluminium articles), embedded emissions of CBAM-relevant precursor materials must be included. The Commission's sectoral guidance maps each CN code to its in-scope precursors.

### 5.6 Common Central Platform certificate handling

Authorised CBAM Declarants maintain a certificate account. Up to 1/3 of certificates held at the end of each quarter may be sold back at original price (mitigates price volatility). Certificates not surrendered by 31 May of the year following the import year are cancelled.

### 5.7 Penalty exposure

| Trigger | Penalty |
|---|---|
| Failure to file quarterly report (transitional period) | EUR 10 – EUR 50 per tonne of unreported emissions (Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 Article 16) |
| Failure to surrender certificates (definitive period) | 3 × the average price of certificates over preceding year × shortfall in tonnes (Article 26) |
| Unauthorised import in definitive period | Goods may be denied release; declarant penalties per Member State implementation |

### 5.8 Verification requirements (definitive period)

**[T1]** Actual emissions data must be verified by an accredited verifier under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2067. Default values do not require verification. The verifier must be accredited in an EU Member State; non-EU verifiers may operate through mutual recognition where established.

### 5.9 Interaction with UK CBAM (from 2027)

The UK announced a domestic CBAM effective 1 January 2027 covering aluminium, cement, ceramics, fertilisers, glass, hydrogen, iron and steel (not electricity). Scope and methodology align broadly with EU CBAM. Goods that pass through the UK before importation to the EU may face double pricing in some scenarios — review preference treatment and customs sequencing.

## Section 6 — Output specification

The reviewer brief must include:

1. **Goods inventory** — every CBAM-relevant import: CN code, quantity, country of origin, installation, declarant of record.
2. **CBAM in-scope determination** — confirmation that CN code is in Annex I and country of origin is not exempt.
3. **Authorised CBAM Declarant status** — application date, approval date, or pending.
4. **Embedded emissions table** — direct and (where applicable) indirect, per shipment, with methodology source.
5. **Default-value usage tracking** — percentage of weight using default values per quarter to confirm ≤ 20% cap (Q4 2024 onwards).
6. **Carbon price adjustment computation** — per shipment with supporting documentation.
7. **Certificate surrender schedule** (definitive period) — total certificates due, free allocation factor applied, current certificate inventory.
8. **Quarterly transitional reports** — XML payload per quarter through Q4 2025.
9. **Annual CBAM declaration** draft (definitive period) — verified emissions, certificates to surrender, supporting documentation.
10. **Reviewer questions** — open items flagged as [T2] or [T3].

## Section 8 — Prohibitions

- **Do not** apply CBAM to CN codes not in Annex I, even if commercially related (CBAM is enumerated, not analogous).
- **Do not** use default values beyond the transitional Q4 2024 limit without documenting the exception under Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 Article 4.
- **Do not** deduct carbon price paid without proof of effective payment and a copy of the underlying regime certification.
- **Do not** treat indirect emissions as in scope for iron, steel, or aluminium during the transitional period and current definitive period (verify the latest delegated act).
- **Do not** advise on structuring imports to circumvent CBAM (e.g., processing in a third country to change CN code) without explicit escalation — anti-circumvention rules apply under Article 27.
