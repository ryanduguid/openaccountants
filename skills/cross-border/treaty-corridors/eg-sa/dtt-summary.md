## Tax Residency Certificate (TRC) Requirements

### Egypt side
- **Format:** Original TRC issued by the Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA)
- **Authentication:** Legalisation (not apostille — Egypt is not an Apostille Convention party for most purposes; verify current status)
- **Validity:** 1 year from date of issue
- **Process:** Egypt applies **pay-and-refund mechanism** under Ministerial Decree 771/2009
  - The 20% domestic WHT rate is withheld at source
  - The non-resident recipient files a refund claim with the ETA special unit for interest/royalty WHT refunds
  - Controversial whether the decree was effectively abolished by 2015 amendments to executive regulations of Income Tax Law No. 91/2005
  - **Practical guidance:** Practically, the ETA still applies the pay-and-refund mechanism. Resident companies should continue to deduct 20% WHT and the non-resident party should claim the refund. Maintain beneficial ownership and TRC documentation at all times for audit defense.

### Saudi Arabia side
- **Format:** Tax Residency Certificate issued by ZATCA (Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority)
- **Validity:** Typically 1 year from date of issue
- **Process:** ZATCA offers a choice:
  1. **Automatic treaty application** — apply reduced rate at time of payment via monthly WHT returns, submit TRC with request form, taxpayer bears full responsibility for understatement including penalties
  2. **Refund procedure** — withhold domestic rate, file refund claim later
- **Conditions:** Report full details of each payment to non-resident, file DTT request form with TRC

## Anti-Treaty-Shopping / PPT (Principal Purpose Test)

The original Article 27 (main-purpose test) has been **replaced by the MLI Article 7 Principal Purpose Test (PPT)**:
- Treaty benefits are **denied** if it is reasonable to conclude, having regard to all relevant facts and circumstances, that obtaining the benefit was one of the principal purposes of the arrangement or transaction
- Benefits are **granted** if it is established that granting them in these circumstances would be in accordance with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty provisions
- This is a broader test than the original main-purpose clause and aligns with OECD BEPS Action 6 standards
- **Substance requirements:** Both authorities may examine whether the treaty claimant has genuine substance (offices, employees, business activities) in the residence state
- **Conduit arrangements:** Using a resident of one state to channel income to a resident of a third state for treaty benefits is likely to be caught by the PPT

## Cross-References to Upstream Skills

- **eg-corporate-tax** — Egypt's corporate income tax (22.5%) applies to resident companies and PEs of non-residents; treaty rates reduce WHT on outbound payments
- **eg-withholding-tax** — Egypt's domestic WHT rates (dividends 5%/10%, interest 20%, royalties 20%, services 20%); treaty provides reduced rates but pay-and-refund mechanism applies
- **sa-corporate-tax** — Saudi Arabia's income tax (20% for non-GCC, Zakat 2.5% for GCC nationals/Saudi entities); treaty rates cap WHT on outbound payments
- **oecd-model-treaty-defaults** — Reference for articles not individually summarized in this corridor file
- **withholding-tax-matrix** — Cross-reference for domestic WHT rates across jurisdictions

---

## Pitfalls and Practical Notes

1. **Egypt pay-and-refund trap:** Egypt does NOT automatically apply reduced treaty rates for interest and royalties. Domestic 20% WHT is withheld; refund claim filed later. Budget for cash flow impact. The 2015 amendment controversy leaves the decree's status unclear — practical approach: follow the pay-and-refund mechanism.

2. **Zakat vs. income tax:** Saudi nationals/GCC persons pay Zakat (2.5%), not income tax. The treaty covers both Zakat and income tax. Article 23(6) protocol: elimination method does not prejudice Zakat collection for Saudi nationals. This means Zakat is not creditable against Egyptian tax.

3. **Beneficial ownership:** Both ETA and ZATCA scrutinize whether the recipient is the true beneficial owner. Conduit companies with no substance in the residence state risk treaty denial under the PPT.

4. **TRC validity:** Ensure TRC is obtained before payment is made and covers the payment period. Expired TRCs invalidate treaty claims.

5. **MLI modifications effective dates:** MLI provisions have different effective dates for WHT (1 Jan 2021) vs. other taxes (1 Jul 2021). Check which MLI article applies to which treaty article.

6. **Construction PE threshold:** 6-month threshold for building/construction sites, but MLI anti-fragmentation means closely related enterprise activities >30 days are aggregated. Structure contracts carefully.

7. **Technical services:** No separate FTS article in this treaty. IP-related technical assistance falls under royalties (Art 12 at 10%). Non-IP technical services fall under business profits (Art 7), taxable only if PE exists in source state. This is a significant advantage over Egypt's 20% domestic WHT on service payments to non-residents.

8. **Saudi non-discrimination article:** The non-discrimination article is NOT currently in force — it applies only prospectively if KSA includes a non-discrimination article in a treaty with a non-GCC country. Verify current status if relevant.

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Saudi company paying dividends to Egyptian shareholder

**Facts:** A Saudi Arabian company (SA Co) distributes SAR 1,000,000 in dividends to its Egyptian parent company (EG HoldCo), which holds 25% of SA Co's capital directly.

**Analysis:**
- Treaty Article 10(2)(a): 5% rate applies because EG HoldCo holds directly ≥20% of capital
- Saudi domestic WHT on dividends: 5% (same as treaty rate)
- WHT = SAR 1,000,000 × 5% = SAR 50,000
- Note: Saudi domestic rate already matches treaty rate — no additional relief needed

### Example 2: Egyptian company paying interest to Saudi bank

**Facts:** An Egyptian company (EG Co) pays EGP 5,000,000 in interest to a Saudi commercial bank (SA Bank, not government-owned).

**Analysis:**
- Treaty Article 11(2): 10% rate applies
- Egyptian domestic WHT on interest: 20%
- Egypt applies pay-and-refund mechanism:
  1. EG Co withholds 20% at source = EGP 1,000,000
  2. SA Bank files refund claim with ETA for differential (20% - 10% = 10%)
  3. Refund amount = EGP 500,000
- Net WHT after refund = EGP 500,000 (10% treaty rate)
- Note: If SA Bank were government-owned (SAMA, GOSI, etc.), Article 11(3) would exempt the interest entirely

### Example 3: Egyptian company paying royalties to Saudi tech company

**Facts:** An Egyptian company (EG Co) pays EGP 2,000,000 in royalties (software licence + know-how) to a Saudi tech company (SA Tech).

**Analysis:**
- Treaty Article 12(2): 10% rate applies (royalties include software licences and technical assistance related to IP)
- Egyptian domestic WHT on royalties: 20%
- Pay-and-refund:
  1. EG Co withholds 20% = EGP 400,000
  2. SA Tech files refund claim for 10% differential = EGP 200,000
  3. Net WHT after refund = EGP 200,000 (10% treaty rate)
- Saudi side: SA Tech receives EGP 1,800,000, reports as business income. If Saudi-owned, Zakat 2.5% applies (not income tax). Article 23(6) protocol: Zakat is not creditable against Egyptian tax.

### Example 4: Construction PE — 7-month project

**Facts:** A Saudi construction company (SA Build) sends a team to Egypt for a 7-month building project for EG Co.

**Analysis:**
- Article 5(3): Construction PE threshold = 6 months
- 7 months > 6 months → PE exists in Egypt
- MLI anti-fragmentation: if SA Build splits the project into two 4-month contracts with a 1-month gap, the closely related enterprise periods (>30 days) are aggregated → PE still exists
- Consequence: Article 7 — profits attributable to PE are taxable in Egypt at 22.5% CIT
- If no PE (e.g., 5 months only): profits taxable only in Saudi Arabia
