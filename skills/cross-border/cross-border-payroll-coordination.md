## Section 1: When Does a Foreign Employee Create Payroll Obligations?

### The Core Question [T1]

If your company is in Country A and you hire someone who works in Country B, you may owe:

| Obligation | Triggered by |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Income tax withholding** in Country B | Employee performing work in Country B (subject to treaty exemptions) |
| **Social security contributions** in Country B | Employee working in Country B (subject to A1/bilateral agreements) |
| **Employment law compliance** in Country B | Employment relationship with a person habitually working in Country B |
| **Corporate tax (PE risk)** in Country B | Employee's activities may create a permanent establishment for the employer |

### Three Approaches to Employing Abroad [T1]

| Approach | How It Works | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Set up a local entity** | Establish a subsidiary or branch in Country B. Full local payroll. | Long-term, multiple employees, need full legal presence |
| **Employer of Record (EOR)** | Third-party company becomes the legal employer in Country B. You manage the work; EOR handles payroll, tax, social security. | 1–10 employees, speed, no local entity desired. Cost: $300–$700/employee/month. |
| **Direct employment (no local entity)** | You employ the person from Country A. Run payroll from Country A + shadow payroll or local registration in Country B. | Single employee, short-term. High compliance risk — not recommended without expert advice. |

### PE Risk from Employees [T2]

An employee working in Country B can create a **permanent establishment** for the employer, triggering corporate tax in Country B:

| PE Trigger | Risk Level |
|-----------|-----------|
| Employee has authority to conclude contracts on behalf of employer | **High** — "dependent agent" PE under OECD Art 5(5) |
| Employee works from a fixed location (home office) regularly | **Medium** — "fixed place of business" PE if employer consents to arrangement |
| Employee performs auxiliary activities only (e.g., market research) | **Low** — typically excluded under Art 5(4) |
| Employee works from Country B for >6 months on a project | **High** — construction/service PE threshold in many treaties |

---

## Section 2: Remote Worker Scenarios

### Employee in Country B, Employer in Country A [T1]

| Scenario | Tax Obligation | Social Security | Action Required |
|----------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Short-term (<183 days, treaty conditions met) | Likely exempt from Country B tax | Country A (with A1/certificate) | Obtain social security certificate. Monitor day count. |
| Long-term (>183 days or treaty conditions not met) | Country B income tax withholding required | Country B (unless A1 applies) | Register for payroll in Country B or use EOR. Shadow payroll may be needed. |
| Permanent relocation to Country B | Full Country B tax and employment law | Country B | Establish local payroll. Update employment contract. |
| Digital nomad (moves between countries) | Depends on days in each country | Complex — may require multi-state determination | Track workdays meticulously. Assess each country's rules. |

### Practical Checklist for Remote Workers Abroad [T1]

1. **Before the employee starts working from Country B:**
   - Assess PE risk in Country B
   - Check tax treaty between Country A and Country B
   - Determine social security obligations (A1 if EU/EEA)
   - Review immigration/work permit requirements
   - Check Country B employment law implications (minimum wage, termination rules, benefits)

2. **During the arrangement:**
   - Track workdays in each country (use timesheets or travel records)
   - File required social security certificates
   - Run shadow payroll if needed (see Section 4)

3. **Common employer policies:**
   - Many companies limit remote work abroad to 30–90 days/year to avoid triggering obligations
   - Some companies maintain a list of "approved" vs "prohibited" countries

## Section 3: Short-Term Business Travelers

### The 183-Day Rule — OECD Model Art 15(2) [T1]

The "183-day rule" is the most cited — and most misunderstood — rule in cross-border employment tax. It provides an **exemption** from host-country tax, NOT an automatic right.

**All three conditions must be met for the exemption to apply:**

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| (a) Days present | The employee is present in the host country for ≤183 days in the relevant period |
| (b) Employer not resident | The remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is NOT a resident of the host country |
| (c) Not borne by PE | The remuneration is NOT borne by a permanent establishment the employer has in the host country |

**If ANY condition fails → host-country tax applies from day one.**

### Counting the 183 Days [T1]

| Treaty Version | Counting Period | Days Counted |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| OECD Model (current) | Any 12-month period starting or ending in the fiscal year | Days of physical presence (including arrival, departure, weekends, holidays, sick days) |
| Older treaties | Calendar year or fiscal year | Same |

### The Economic Employer Concept [T2]

Many countries now look beyond the formal employer to the **substance** of the relationship:

| Factor | Question |
|--------|----------|
| Supervision | Who directs and controls the employee's daily work? |
| Risk | Who bears the risk of the employee's work product? |
| Integration | Is the employee integrated into the host entity's organisation? |
| Cost reallocation | Is the home entity cross-charging the employee's cost to the host entity? |

**If the host entity is the "economic employer," condition (b) of Art 15(2) fails — even if the employee is formally employed and paid by the home entity.** Host-country tax withholding is then required from day one.

Countries actively applying economic employer concepts: **Germany, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, UK, Australia, India, Singapore.**

### Business Traveler Compliance Matrix [T1]

| Days in Host Country | Treaty Exemption Likely? | Recommended Action |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 1–30 days/year | Usually exempt | Track days. Obtain A1 if EU. |
| 31–60 days/year | Usually exempt | Track days carefully. Check local de minimis rules. |
| 61–90 days/year | Likely exempt if treaty conditions met | Track days. Consider shadow payroll registration as precaution. |
| 91–183 days/year | Exempt only if ALL three conditions met | Formal assessment required. Shadow payroll likely needed. |
| >183 days/year | Condition (a) fails — host tax applies | Full payroll registration in host country. |

---

## Section 4: Shadow Payroll / Hypothetical Tax

### What Is Shadow Payroll? [T1]

Shadow payroll is a **parallel payroll record** in the host country that calculates and remits host-country income tax and (sometimes) social security, while the employee continues to be paid through home-country payroll.

| Element | Home Payroll | Shadow Payroll (Host) |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Salary payment | YES — employee is paid through home payroll | NO — no separate payment to employee |
| Tax withholding | May need adjustment (home country) | YES — calculates and remits host-country tax |
| Social security | Depends on A1/certificate | Depends on applicable legislation |
| Reporting | Home-country tax return | Host-country payroll filings |

### When Shadow Payroll Is Required [T1]

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Assignment exceeds treaty de minimis | Employee works 200 days in Germany but is paid from UK payroll |
| Cost recharged to host entity | US parent recharged employee cost to German subsidiary — condition (c) fails |
| Economic employer in host country | Swedish tax authority determines Swedish entity is the economic employer |
| Remote worker in a country with no employer entity | Employee relocates to Portugal; employer has no Portuguese entity but must withhold tax |

### Hypothetical Tax (Tax Equalisation) [T2]

| Concept | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Tax equalisation | Company ensures the employee pays no more (and no less) tax than they would have paid staying in their home country |
| Hypothetical tax | The home-country tax the employee "would have" paid — deducted from salary. Company pays the actual tax in both countries and absorbs any difference. |
| Tax protection | Employee pays actual taxes, but company reimburses if host-country tax exceeds what home-country tax would have been |

---

## Section 5: Social Security Certificates

### EU: A1 Certificate (Portable Document A1) [T1]

**Legislation:** Regulation (EC) No 883/2004, coordinated by Regulation (EC) No 987/2009.

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Purpose | Proves which country's social security system applies, preventing double contributions |
| When needed | Any time a person works in an EU/EEA/Swiss country other than where they normally pay social security |
| Who applies | The employer or self-employed person, to the competent institution of the home country |
| Duration | Up to 24 months for posted workers (Art 12); renewable |
| Without A1 | The host country can demand social security contributions under its own rules |

### Key EU Social Security Rules [T1]

| Situation | Applicable Legislation |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Posted worker (temporary, ≤24 months) | Home country (Art 12) — A1 required |
| Working in 2+ EU countries | Country of residence if ≥25% of activity there; otherwise employer's country (Art 13) |
| Teleworking (Multilateral Framework Agreement, 2023) | If 25–49.99% of working time in residence country, may remain under employer's country legislation |
| Self-employed person working temporarily in another EU state | Home country (Art 12(2)) — A1 required |

### 2026 Update

In April 2026, the EU reached a provisional agreement to modernize Regulation 883/2004:
- Proposed exemptions from A1 requirements for **short-term business trips**
- Initial A1 certificates can be issued for up to **24 months** subject to renewal
- Greater employer responsibility for documentation
- 24-month transitional period expected for certain elements

### Non-EU: Bilateral Social Security Agreements [T1]

| Countries | Agreement Covers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| US–UK | Totalization agreement — prevents double social security |
| US–Germany, US–France, US–Italy, US–Japan | Same principle — worker pays into one system only |
| UK–EU (TCA Protocol) | 24-month posting limit; governed by Trade and Cooperation Agreement |
| Australia–numerous | Bilateral agreements with 30+ countries |
| India–select countries | Agreements with Germany, France, Belgium, Netherlands, and others |

**Without a bilateral agreement:** The employee may owe social security in **both** countries simultaneously — a potentially devastating cost for freelancers and small companies.

---

## Section 6: Contractor vs Employee Cross-Border

### The Misclassification Risk [T1]

A worker can be a legitimate contractor under one country's law and a misclassified employee under another's. **The host country's classification rules apply to work performed there, regardless of what the contract says.**

### Classification Tests by Country [T1]

| Country | Test | Key Factors |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **US** | Common-law (IRS) / ABC test (California AB5) | Behavioral control, financial control, type of relationship. CA: strict ABC test — B (outside usual course of business) is hardest to meet. |
| **UK** | IR35 off-payroll rules | Personal service, mutuality of obligation, control. Since April 2021, medium/large hirers determine status. |
| **Germany** | Deutsche Rentenversicherung | Integration into business, economic dependence, single-client >83% of income triggers mandatory pension |
| **France** | Code du Travail | Subordination link (lien de subordination) — fixed schedule, supervision, integration |
| **Netherlands** | DBA (Deregulering Beoordeling Arbeidsrelaties) | Enforcement moratorium lifted January 2025. Active auditing in 2026. |
| **Spain** | Estatuto de los Trabajadores | Reclassified contractors receive full employment rights retroactively |
| **Australia** | "Whole-of-relationship" test (Closing Loopholes reforms 2024) | Practical reality, not contract terms. Sham contracting penalties up to AUD 469,500. |
| **India** | Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act | Supervision, control, integration into principal employer's work |

### Penalties for Misclassification [T1]

| Country | Penalty |
|---------|---------|
| Germany | Retroactive social security for 4 years (30 years if intentional); fines up to €500,000; criminal prosecution possible (§266a StGB) |
| France | Fines from €45,000; potential imprisonment for repeat offenders |
| UK | Employer pays back-tax, NICs, and penalties for IR35 failures |
| US (federal) | 20% of wages owed + 100% of unpaid FICA. California: $5,000–$25,000 per wilful violation |
| Netherlands | Retroactive corrections + penalties under resumed DBA enforcement |
| Australia | Up to AUD 469,500 per contravention + back superannuation + 6 years of back leave |
| Spain | Full retroactive employment rights (severance, paid leave, social security) |

### EU Platform Work Directive (2024/2831) [T1]

Effective December 1, 2024. Member states must transpose by **December 2, 2026**:

- Creates a **rebuttable presumption of employment** for platform workers
- Platforms must rebut the presumption to maintain contractor status
- Does **not** apply to tax, criminal, or social security proceedings (employment law only)
- Member states will define penalties — must be "effective, dissuasive, and proportionate"

---

## Section 7: Equity Compensation Cross-Border

### The Problem [T2]

When an employee receives stock options or RSUs and **works in multiple countries during the vesting period**, multiple countries may claim the right to tax the same income.

### Time-Based Apportionment Formula [T1]

Most jurisdictions and tax treaties use:

```
Income sourced to Country X = (Days worked in Country X during vesting period ÷ Total days in vesting period) × Total vest value
```

### Country-Specific Timing of Tax [T2]

| Country | RSUs Taxed At | Stock Options Taxed At | Character |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| US | Vesting | Exercise (NSO) or sale (ISO) | Ordinary income (RSU/NSO); capital gain (ISO at sale) |
| UK | Vesting | Exercise | Employment income; capital gains on sale |
| Germany | Vesting | Exercise | Employment income; Abgeltungsteuer on sale |
| France | Vesting (with qualified plan exceptions) | Exercise or sale (depending on plan) | Salary income + social charges; capital gains on sale |
| India | Vesting/allotment (perquisite) | Exercise (perquisite) | Salary income; capital gains on sale |
| Australia | Vesting (taxed upfront scheme) or sale (deferred scheme) | Exercise or sale | Employment income / capital gains |

### Double Taxation Relief [T2]

| Mechanism | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Foreign Tax Credit** | Home country gives credit for tax paid abroad on the same equity income (limited to home-country tax on that income) |
| **Treaty allocation** | Tax treaty may allocate taxing rights based on where services were performed during vesting |
| **Tax equalisation** | Employer absorbs excess tax burden through hypothetical tax arrangement |

### Example: Employee Moves Mid-Vest [T2]

**Facts:** Employee granted 1,000 RSUs with 4-year vest. Works in Germany for years 1–2, then moves to UK for years 3–4. Vest value: €200,000.

| Country | Apportionment | Taxable Amount |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Germany | 730 / 1,460 days = 50% | €100,000 at German income tax rates |
| UK | 730 / 1,460 days = 50% | £85,000 (converted) at UK income tax rates |

Both countries tax their portion. Employee claims Foreign Tax Credit in whichever country is the residence at vest to avoid double taxation. Coordination between German and UK advisors is essential.

---

## Section 8: Practical Scenarios

### Scenario 1 — Remote Developer, Employer US, Worker in Portugal [T1]

**Facts:** US tech company hires a developer who lives and works from Portugal. No EOR. No Portuguese entity.

**Issues:**
- Portugal requires income tax withholding on employment income earned there
- Portuguese social security contributions are owed (no US-Portugal totalization agreement)
- The developer's home office could create a PE for the US company in Portugal
- Portuguese employment law may apply (termination protections, minimum benefits)

**Recommendation:** Use an EOR in Portugal, or register the US company for Portuguese payroll. Do NOT ignore local obligations.

### Scenario 2 — Business Traveler, UK Employee Visits Germany 80 Days [T1]

**Facts:** UK employee travels to the German subsidiary for 80 days in a 12-month period.

**Assessment:**
- 80 days < 183 days ✓
- Paid by UK employer ✓
- BUT: Is cost recharged to German subsidiary? If yes, condition (c) fails.
- Does Germany apply economic employer concept? Yes — if German entity supervises and benefits, tax may be due from day one.

**Recommendation:** Assess economic employer status. If recharge exists, set up shadow payroll in Germany. Obtain A1 certificate for social security.

### Scenario 3 — Contractor in India for UK Client [T1]

**Facts:** UK company engages an Indian independent contractor for software development. Paid monthly in GBP.

**Assessment:**
- If genuinely independent (own clients, own tools, no integration): legitimate contractor
- India's contract labour rules and withholding requirements still apply
- UK IR35 does NOT apply to overseas contractors (only UK-based engagements)
- Indian contractor must invoice with GST if registered, or without if below threshold

**Key risk:** If the Indian "contractor" works exclusively for the UK company, Indian authorities may reclassify as employment.

### Scenario 4 — EU Posted Worker, Malta to Germany [T1]

**Facts:** Maltese company sends an employee to Germany for 18 months.

**Assessment:**
- A1 certificate needed: apply to Malta's social security authority
- Employee remains under Maltese social security (Art 12, ≤24 months)
- German income tax withholding required (>183 days)
- Shadow payroll needed in Germany
- EU Posted Workers Directive: employee must receive at least German minimum wage, working time limits, and other core conditions

---

## PROHIBITIONS

1. **NEVER** assume the 183-day rule is an automatic exemption. All three conditions must be met.
2. **NEVER** ignore the economic employer concept in countries that apply it — host-country tax can be triggered from day one.
3. **NEVER** rely on the contract label (contractor vs employee) to determine classification. Host-country substance-over-form rules apply.
4. **NEVER** skip the A1 certificate for EU/EEA cross-border work. Without it, the host country can demand contributions.
5. **NEVER** assume equity compensation is only taxed in the country where the employee is at vest. Multi-country apportionment applies.
6. **NEVER** let an employee work remotely from a foreign country without assessing PE risk, tax obligations, and social security.
7. **NEVER** ignore employment law in the host country. Local minimum wage, termination rules, and benefits may apply regardless of what the contract says.
