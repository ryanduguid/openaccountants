# International Company Formation — Jurisdiction Selection Guide

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

> **Disclaimer:** This skill provides general guidance on international company formation. It does not constitute legal or tax advice. All structures and tax treatments must be verified with qualified local advisors (CPAs, tax attorneys, chartered accountants) in the relevant jurisdictions before implementation. Tax rules, costs, and compliance requirements change frequently.

## Workflow

1. **Identify the user's profile** — nationality, business type, revenue, customer location, primary goal.
2. **Check forex constraints** — if the user's home country has strict forex controls, this narrows jurisdiction choices (see `forex-controls.md`).
3. **Apply the jurisdiction decision tree** — match profile to recommended structure.
4. **Present the comparison** — costs, tax rates, compliance burden, banking options.
5. **Flag ongoing obligations** — annual filings, penalties for non-compliance, substance requirements.

## Tier 1 Jurisdictions — Best for Most Solo Founders

### United States — Wyoming LLC

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 0% federal (pass-through for non-US owners) |
| Personal tax | 0% for non-US owners; US citizens pay federal income + SE tax (~15.3%) |
| Setup cost | $100–500 USD |
| Setup timeline | 1–3 days |
| Annual cost | $60–600 USD (annual report + registered agent) |
| Banking | Mercury (remote opening), Wise Business |
| Substance required | None for non-US LLC owners |

**Best for:** Global SaaS, digital services, any solo founder wanting US credibility without US tax liability.

**Key advantage:** A US LLC owned by a non-US person is a "disregarded entity" for US tax purposes — 0% US federal income tax. Only taxed where the owner is personally tax-resident.

**Watch out:** US citizens face self-employment tax (~15.3%). EIN required for banking. Form 5472 filing mandatory for non-US owners ($25,000 penalty per form per year if missed).

### United States — Delaware LLC / C-Corp

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 0% federal (LLC pass-through); 21% federal (C-Corp) |
| Setup cost | $90 filing + $300/year franchise tax (LLC); $500 via Stripe Atlas (C-Corp) |
| Setup timeline | 1–2 days |
| Annual cost | $300+ franchise tax |
| Banking | Mercury, Stripe Atlas pipeline |

**Best for:** Founders planning to raise US VC funding. Delaware is the gold standard for SAFE notes and convertible instruments.

**Stripe Atlas pipeline:** Pay $500 → Delaware C-Corp incorporated → EIN procured → Mercury bank account → Stripe payments activated. Total time: ~1–2 weeks.

### Singapore — Pte. Ltd.

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 17% headline (effective ~8.5% on first SGD 200,000 with startup exemption) |
| Capital gains | 0% |
| Dividend WHT | 0% |
| Setup cost | SGD 300–800 |
| Setup timeline | 1–2 days |
| Annual cost | SGD 3,000–5,000 (nominee director + secretary + filing) |
| Banking | DBS, OCBC (may require in-person visit) |

**Best for:** Asia-Pacific-focused businesses with revenue >$50,000 USD/year.

**Requirements:** At least 1 Singapore-resident director (nominee ~SGD 2,000/year), mandatory company secretary, registered office in Singapore.

### Estonia — e-Residency OÜ

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 0% on retained profits; 20% on distributions |
| Setup cost | ~€385 (e-Residency card + registration) |
| Setup timeline | 2–4 weeks |
| Annual cost | €500–1,500 |
| Banking | Wise Business (primary), LHV |

**Best for:** Non-EU founders needing EU market access who reinvest most profits. Fully remote administration.

**Critical:** e-Residency does NOT confer Estonian tax residency. Personal tax is owed where the owner actually resides.

### Dubai — Freezone

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 9% on income >AED 375,000; 0% below |
| Personal income tax | 5% (effective January 2026; was 0% until December 2025) |
| Setup cost | AED 5,000–15,000 |
| Setup timeline | 3–10 days |
| Annual cost | AED 10,000–20,000 (license + visa + office + insurance) |
| Banking | Emirates NBD, Mashreq, Wise |

**Best for:** Founders willing to relocate to UAE for low combined personal + corporate tax.

**Requirements:** Must actually live in UAE to establish tax residency. Popular freezones: DMCC, IFZA, Meydan.

## Tier 2 Jurisdictions — Good for Specific Situations

### United Kingdom — Ltd

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 19% (first £50,000); 25% (above £250,000) |
| Setup cost | £12 |
| Setup timeline | Same day |
| Annual cost | £200–500 |
| Banking | Wise Business, Revolut Business |

**Best for:** UK/EU clients, B2B consulting. Cheapest and fastest incorporation globally.

### Hong Kong — Limited Company (有限公司)

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Corporate tax | 8.25% (first HKD 2,000,000); 16.5% above |
| Offshore income | 0% (if properly structured — see substance requirements) |
| Dividend WHT | 0% |
| Setup cost | HKD 3,000–5,000 (~$400–650 USD) |
| Setup timeline | 1–2 weeks |
| Annual cost | HKD 5,000–10,000 |
| Banking | HSBC, ZA Bank, Airwallex HK |

**Best for:** Chinese mainland founders (大陆创始人) — no forex controls in HK, Stripe HK available, offshore income exemption.

**Offshore profits claim (离岸免税):** If business is conducted outside HK (no HK office, no HK employees, contracts signed outside HK), offshore income can be 0% taxed. FSIE rules (2023+) tightened substance requirements for passive income.

## Entity Structures for Chinese Founders (大陆创始人)

### Recommended: HK Ltd + 个体户 Combination

```
Chinese Founder (个人)
├── Hong Kong Limited Company (有限公司)
│   ├── Receives global payments via Stripe HK / PayPal / Airwallex
│   ├── Offshore profits taxed at 0% (if business conducted outside HK)

└── 个体户 (mainland)
    ├── Issues invoice (增值税普票) to HK company
    └── Pays 0.5–2% effective tax (核定征收 rate)
```

**Service fee requirements:** Real service agreement with market-rate pricing, valid 增值税普票 issued, documented deliverables. Service fee should not exceed 50% of HK company revenue (transfer pricing scrutiny threshold).

### Getting Money Back to Mainland

| Method | Tax Treatment |
|--------|---------------|
| Salary from HK company | Subject to HK salaries tax if work performed in HK |
| Dividends | No HK WHT; China 20% individual income tax on foreign dividends |

| Personal remittance | Within annual $50,000 USD forex limit |

---

## Company Closure / Winding Down

| Jurisdiction | Process | Cost | Timeline |
|--------------|---------|------|----------|
| Wyoming LLC | Articles of Dissolution + settle debts + final tax return | $0 state fee | 1–3 months |
| Delaware LLC | Certificate of Cancellation + final franchise tax | $200+ | 1–3 months |
| Singapore Pte. Ltd. | ACRA striking off or voluntary winding up | SGD 30–3,000+ | 3–6 months |
| Estonia OÜ | Liquidation via e-Business Register | €200–500 | 3–12 months |
| UK Ltd | Striking off (DS01 form) or voluntary liquidation | £10 | 3–6 months |
| Hong Kong Ltd | Companies Registry deregistration or voluntary winding up | HKD 690 | 5–7 months |
| Dubai Freezone | Cancel license + deregister + cancel visa | AED 2,000–5,000 | 2–4 months |

**Never abandon a company without formal dissolution.** Penalties, late fees, and government liens continue to accrue on dormant entities.

---

## Operating Agreement (US LLC)

Every LLC — even single-member — needs an operating agreement covering:

1. **Membership interest** — who owns what percentage
2. **Management structure** — member-managed vs manager-managed
3. **Distribution policy** — when and how profits are distributed
4. **Succession / death provisions** — who takes over if the sole member dies or becomes incapacitated
5. **Buy-sell mechanism** — dissolution or transfer procedures

**US estate tax risk for non-US owners:** Non-US persons owning US-sited assets >$60,000 face federal estate tax up to 40% at death. Holding a US LLC through a foreign holding company (e.g., HK Ltd) removes this exposure.
