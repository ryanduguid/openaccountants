## Section 1 — Parent-Subsidiary Directive (Council Directive 2011/96/EU)

### Purpose

Eliminates withholding tax on dividend distributions between qualifying parent companies and subsidiaries in different EU member states. Prevents economic double taxation of distributed profits within EU groups.

### Key provisions

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **WHT exemption (Art 5)** | Member state of subsidiary may NOT impose withholding tax on profits distributed to a qualifying parent in another member state |
| **Participation exemption or credit (Art 4)** | Member state of parent must either exempt received dividends OR tax them while granting a credit for underlying corporate tax paid by subsidiary |
| **Minimum holding (Art 3)** | Parent must hold at least **10%** of the capital (or voting rights) of the subsidiary |
| **Minimum holding period (Art 3)** | The 10% holding must be maintained for an **uninterrupted period of at least 2 years** (member states may apply the exemption provisionally pending completion of the 2-year period) |
| **Qualifying entities (Annex I)** | Only entities listed in Annex I Part A qualify (includes GmbH, Ltd, SA, SRL, BV, etc. — all standard corporate forms in EU member states) |
| **Subject to tax requirement** | Both entities must be subject to one of the corporate taxes listed in Annex I Part B, without an option or exemption |

### Anti-abuse clause (Art 1(2)–(3), as amended by Directive 2015/121)

Member states shall NOT grant the benefits of the PSD to an arrangement or series of arrangements which:
- Have been put in place for the **main purpose or one of the main purposes** of obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object or purpose of the Directive, AND
- Are **not genuine**, meaning they are not put in place for valid commercial reasons reflecting economic reality

**CJEU guidance (Nordcurrent, C-228/24, September 2024):**
- Anti-abuse applies not only to WHT exemption (Art 5) but also to participation exemption (Art 4(1)(a))
- Requires BOTH subjective element (intention to obtain tax advantage) AND objective element (defeats directive purpose)
- Cannot rely on fragmented facts alone — must assess the arrangement as a whole
- Extends interpretation to analogous provisions in IRD (Art 5(1)) and Merger Directive (Art 15(1)(a))

### Practical application for freelancers and small businesses

The PSD is primarily relevant for:
- A parent company in one EU state receiving dividends from a subsidiary in another EU state
- Multi-entity groups structured across EU borders

**NOT relevant for:** Individual freelancers, sole traders, or unrelated B2B payments. Those are governed by domestic law and bilateral treaties.

---

## Section 2 — Interest & Royalties Directive (Council Directive 2003/49/EC)

### Purpose

Eliminates withholding tax on interest and royalty payments between **associated** companies in different EU member states.

### Key provisions

| Provision | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **WHT exemption (Art 1)** | Interest and royalty payments between associated EU companies are exempt from any taxes (including WHT) in the source state |
| **Association requirement (Art 3)** | Companies are "associated" if one holds at least **25% of the capital** of the other, OR a third company holds at least **25% of both** |
| **Minimum holding period** | The 25% holding must be maintained for an **uninterrupted period of at least 2 years** |
| **Beneficial ownership (Art 1(4))** | The recipient company must be the **beneficial owner** of the interest/royalties (not merely a conduit) |
| **PE attribution (Art 1(2))** | If the recipient has a PE in the source state and the debt/right is effectively connected with that PE, the exemption does not apply (domestic rules of the PE state govern) |

### Definitions

| Term | Directive Definition (Art 2) |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Interest** | Income from debt-claims of every kind, including premiums and prizes attaching to bonds/debentures; penalty charges for late payment are NOT interest |
| **Royalties** | Payments for the use of, or right to use, any copyright of literary/artistic/scientific work (including software), patent, trade mark, design/model, plan, secret formula/process, or industrial/commercial/scientific equipment |

### Transitional withholding (now expired)

Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia previously had transitional periods allowing reduced-rate WHT. All transitional periods have now expired — full exemption applies across all EU-27 states.

### Anti-abuse (Art 5)

The Directive does not prevent the application of domestic or treaty-based anti-avoidance provisions needed to prevent fraud or abuse. Member states may withdraw benefits or refuse to apply the Directive in cases of:
- Arrangements whose principal motive (or one of the principal motives) is tax evasion, tax avoidance, or abuse
- Payments to entities not meeting beneficial ownership

### Practical limitation for freelancers

The IRD requires a **25% capital relationship** between the payer and recipient. It does NOT apply to:
- Unrelated B2B interest payments (e.g., freelancer loan to unrelated company)
- Unrelated B2B royalty payments (e.g., freelancer licensing IP to unrelated company)
- Individual-to-company payments

For unrelated parties, the bilateral tax treaty (if any) governs WHT rates on interest and royalties. See `withholding-tax-matrix.md`.

## Section 3 — Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive (ATAD I: 2016/1164; ATAD II: 2017/952)

### Purpose

Establishes minimum anti-avoidance rules that all EU member states must implement in their domestic corporate tax systems. Targets the most common forms of aggressive tax planning identified in the OECD BEPS project.

### Five measures in ATAD I (Directive 2016/1164)

| Measure | Article | Rule | Threshold/Scope |
|---------|---------|------|-----------------|
| **Interest limitation** | Art 4 | Net borrowing costs deductible only up to **30% of EBITDA** (or €3M de minimis — higher of the two) | Applies to all taxpayers subject to corporate tax; member states may exclude standalone entities or financial undertakings |
| **Exit taxation** | Art 5 | When assets/tax residence/PE is transferred out of a member state, that state may tax **unrealized capital gains** as if the assets had been sold at fair market value | Mandatory installment option over 5 years for transfers within EU/EEA; immediate payment for transfers to third countries |
| **General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR)** | Art 6 | Member states shall ignore arrangements whose **main purpose** is obtaining a tax advantage that defeats the object/purpose of applicable tax law, where NOT put in place for valid commercial reasons reflecting economic reality | Applies to corporate income tax only; member states may have broader domestic GAARs |
| **Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) rules** | Art 7–8 | Parent company includes in its tax base the non-distributed income of a controlled foreign entity if that entity's actual corporate tax is less than **50% of what it would have paid** under the parent's state tax rules | CFC = entity where taxpayer holds >50% capital/voting rights/profit entitlement (directly or indirectly) |
| **Hybrid mismatches** | Art 9 (ATAD I), extended by ATAD II (2017/952) | Deny deduction / require inclusion when a mismatch between two tax systems results in double deduction, deduction without inclusion, or double non-taxation | ATAD II extends to third-country mismatches, reverse hybrids, imported mismatches, and tax residency mismatches |

### CFC rules — practical detail

Two options available to member states for defining CFC income:

| Option | Approach | Countries using |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| **Model A (entity approach)** | Include ALL non-distributed income of the CFC if it fails the substance/activity test | Germany, France, Italy, Spain |
| **Model B (transactional approach)** | Include only specific categories of "tainted" income (interest, royalties, dividends, financial leasing, insurance/banking, income from invoicing with no economic value added) | Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg |

### Exit taxation — key rules for relocating founders

| Transfer type | Tax event | Installment available? |
|--------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Transfer of assets from head office to PE in another state | Deemed disposal at FMV | Yes (5 years, within EU/EEA) |
| Transfer of assets from PE to head office in another state | Deemed disposal at FMV | Yes (5 years, within EU/EEA) |
| Transfer of tax residence from one state to another | Deemed disposal of ALL assets at FMV | Yes (5 years, within EU/EEA) |
| Transfer to third country (non-EU/EEA) | Deemed disposal at FMV | NO — immediate payment (member states MAY offer installments voluntarily) |

**Interaction with `tax-residency-planning.md`:** When a founder relocates, ATAD Art 5 governs the corporate exit tax on their company's assets. Personal exit tax (e.g., German § 6 AStG on shares) is domestic law, not ATAD — but ATAD ensures ALL member states have at least a corporate exit tax.

## Section 4 — Mandatory Disclosure Rules (DAC6, DAC7, DAC8)

### DAC6 — Cross-border arrangement reporting (Directive 2018/822)

**In force since:** 1 July 2020 (reporting); arrangements from 25 June 2018 to 30 June 2020 reported retroactively.

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Who reports** | Intermediaries (tax advisors, lawyers, accountants, banks) — or taxpayer if no EU intermediary or legal privilege applies |
| **What is reported** | Cross-border arrangements meeting at least one "hallmark" |
| **When** | Within 30 days of (a) making available, (b) ready for implementation, or (c) first step taken |
| **Where** | To the tax authority of the member state where the intermediary/taxpayer is located |
| **Exchange** | Information shared automatically via EU Central Directory with all affected member states |

### DAC6 Hallmarks (Categories A–E)

| Category | Subject | Main benefit test required? |
|----------|---------|---------------------------|
| **A** | Generic hallmarks (confidentiality, standardized docs, contingent fees) | YES |
| **B** | Specific hallmarks (acquiring loss companies, converting income, round-tripping) | YES |
| **C** | Cross-border payments (deduction without inclusion, preferential regime, depreciation on same asset in two states) | SOME (C1 yes; C2–C4 no) |
| **D** | Automatic exchange of information avoidance, beneficial ownership opacity | NO |
| **E** | Transfer pricing (unilateral safe harbour, hard-to-value intangibles, intra-group transfers with >50% EBITDA shift) | NO |

**Main benefit test:** The arrangement meets a hallmark only if it can be established that the main benefit (or one of the main benefits) was to obtain a tax advantage. Categories D and E and some C hallmarks do NOT require the main benefit test — they are reportable regardless of motive.

### DAC7 — Platform operator reporting (Directive 2021/514)

**In force since:** 1 January 2023 (reporting obligations); first reports due 31 January 2024.

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Who reports** | Digital platform operators (EU and non-EU platforms with EU sellers) |
| **What is reported** | Income earned by sellers through the platform: rental of immovable property, personal services, sale of goods (> 30 transactions or > €2,000), rental of transport |
| **When** | Annually, by 31 January of the following year |
| **To whom** | Single EU member state (one-stop-shop registration for non-EU platforms) |
| **Relevance for freelancers** | Platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, Airbnb, Uber, Etsy report seller income → tax authorities may cross-check against filed returns |

### DAC8 — Crypto-asset reporting (Directive 2023/2226)

**In force since:** 1 January 2026 (first reporting year); first exchanges by 30 September 2027.

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Who reports** | Reporting Crypto-Asset Service Providers (RCASPs) — exchanges, custodians, brokers, decentralized platform operators meeting criteria |
| **What is reported** | Transactions in crypto-assets: acquisitions, disposals, exchanges; aggregate consideration and number of units per crypto-asset type |
| **When** | Calendar year collection; report to national authority in following year; exchange with residence state by 30 Sep following year |
| **Scope** | All EU-resident and non-resident users transacting through EU-based RCASPs |
| **Relevance** | Tax authorities will receive detailed crypto transaction data — freelancers receiving crypto payments or holding crypto should ensure capital gains/income are properly reported |

---

## Section 5 — EU Merger Directive (Council Directive 2009/133/EC, recast)

### Purpose

Ensures that cross-border corporate reorganizations (mergers, divisions, transfers of assets, exchanges of shares) between EU companies are **tax-neutral** — no immediate taxation on unrealized gains arising solely from the reorganization.

### Key provisions

| Operation | Treatment |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Cross-border merger** | No taxation of capital gains on assets transferred to the receiving company; receiving company takes over the tax values (carryover basis) |
| **Cross-border division** | Same as merger — tax-neutral split |
| **Transfer of assets (branch)** | No taxation if assets remain connected with a PE of the receiving company in the transferring state |
| **Exchange of shares** | No taxation of the shareholder on gain arising from the exchange; cost basis carries over |

### Conditions for tax neutrality

| Condition | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Qualifying entities** | Companies listed in the Annex (standard corporate forms in EU member states) |
| **Subject to tax** | Both companies must be subject to corporate tax without exemption |
| **Cross-border element** | At least two different EU member states involved |
| **Carryover of values** | Receiving company must take over the fiscal values (not step up to FMV) |
| **PE attribution** | Transferred assets must remain effectively connected with a PE in the state of the transferring company (for asset transfers) |

### Anti-abuse (Art 15)

Member states may refuse to apply the Directive if the operation:
- Has as its **principal objective** (or one of its principal objectives) tax evasion or tax avoidance
- Is NOT carried out for **valid commercial reasons** such as restructuring or rationalization

The fact that an operation is not carried out for valid commercial reasons may constitute a presumption that the operation has tax avoidance as its principal objective.

### Relevance for OpenAccountants users

The Merger Directive is relevant when:
- A founder wants to merge their company in state A with a company in state B
- A group wants to transfer a branch from one EU state to another without triggering capital gains tax
- A share-for-share exchange is used to restructure an EU group

**T3 for all cases.** Cross-border reorganizations always require specialist advice. This skill identifies the framework; it does NOT compute the tax consequences.

## Section 6 — 2026 Omnibus Directive Proposal

In February 2026, the European Commission launched a call for evidence on simplifying EU direct taxation rules. The Commission intends to propose an omnibus directive by June 2026 to:

- Streamline and clarify the PSD, IRD, Merger Directive, ATAD, and Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanisms Directive
- Align anti-abuse provisions across directives (currently worded differently in each)
- Address administrative burden and outdated/overlapping rules
- Respond to CJEU case law developments (particularly on beneficial ownership and anti-abuse)

**Status as of May 2026:** Proposal pending. No text published yet. Current directive provisions remain in force unchanged.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

1. **NEVER** advise setting up structures specifically to access PSD or IRD benefits without genuine commercial substance. This triggers anti-abuse provisions.
2. **NEVER** assume the PSD applies to holdings below 10% or the IRD to holdings below 25%. Thresholds are strict.
3. **NEVER** advise on structures designed to avoid DAC6 reporting. If an arrangement is reportable, it must be reported.
4. **NEVER** compute exit tax amounts under ATAD Art 5. Flag the trigger and escalate to specialist.
5. **NEVER** assume CFC rules don't apply because a subsidiary is in another EU member state. ATAD CFC rules apply regardless of location if the effective tax rate test is met.
6. **NEVER** advise that the Merger Directive makes all reorganizations tax-free. It provides neutrality only if all conditions are met and the anti-abuse exception doesn't apply.
