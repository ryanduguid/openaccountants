## Section 1 — Article 4: Residence

### Model provision (Art 4(1))

> "For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'resident of a Contracting State' means any person who, under the laws of that State, is liable to tax therein by reason of his domicile, residence, place of management or any other criterion of a similar nature."

### Dual residence tie-breaker for individuals (Art 4(2))

When an individual is resident in BOTH contracting states under their domestic laws, the following tests apply **in sequence** (stop at the first test that resolves):

| Priority | Test | Key factors | Resolution |
|----------|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | **Permanent home available** | Does the person have a home continuously available in one state? Includes owned or rented accommodation. A home rented OUT to others is NOT "available." | If permanent home in only ONE state → resident there |
| 2 | **Centre of vital interests** | Where are personal and economic relations closer? Family, social connections, employment, business activities, political/cultural activities, property, bank accounts | If centre of vital interests in only ONE state → resident there |
| 3 | **Habitual abode** | Where does the person stay habitually? Assessed over a sufficient period (not just the current year). Compares frequency/duration of presence in each state | If habitual abode in only ONE state → resident there |
| 4 | **Nationality** | Citizenship | If national of only ONE state → resident there |
| 5 | **Mutual Agreement Procedure** | Competent authorities negotiate | If all above fail → MAP between governments (typically 24–36 months) |

### Dual residence tie-breaker for entities (Art 4(3))

For entities (companies) resident in both states, the 2017 update replaced the "place of effective management" (POEM) automatic tie-breaker with a **MAP requirement**: the competent authorities shall determine by mutual agreement the state of residence, having regard to:
- Place of effective management
- Place of incorporation/constitution
- Any other relevant factors

If no agreement → entity NOT entitled to treaty benefits (except as agreed).

### Practical guidance

- The tie-breaker cascade ONLY applies when BOTH states claim the person as a full tax resident under their domestic law
- Many older treaties still use the pre-2017 formulation for entities (POEM as automatic tie-breaker)
- The 2025 update did not change Article 4 — the remote work Commentary additions are under Article 5

## Section 2 — Article 5: Permanent Establishment

### Model definition (Art 5(1))

> "For the purposes of this Convention, the term 'permanent establishment' means a fixed place of business through which the business of an enterprise is wholly or partly carried on."

### Three-element test

| Element | Requirement | Assessment |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Place of business** | A facility — office, room, factory, workshop, desk, even a pitch in a marketplace | Must be a tangible, identifiable location |
| **Fixed** | Established at a distinct spot with a degree of permanence (not merely temporary) | Generally requires more than 6 months; some treaties specify thresholds |
| **Business carried on through it** | The enterprise actually conducts its business activities at/through the place | Preparatory/auxiliary activities excluded (Art 5(4)) |

### Specific inclusion list (Art 5(2))

The following are expressly included as PE examples:
- Place of management
- Branch
- Office
- Factory
- Workshop
- Mine, oil/gas well, quarry, or other extraction site

### Construction PE (Art 5(3))

> "A building site or construction or installation project constitutes a PE only if it lasts more than twelve months."

Many bilateral treaties reduce this to **6 months** (check specific treaty). The 12-month clock starts when preparatory work begins at the site and stops when work is permanently discontinued.

### Exclusions — NOT a PE (Art 5(4))

| Activity | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Storage, display, or delivery of goods belonging to the enterprise | NOT a PE |
| Maintenance of stock for processing by another enterprise | NOT a PE |
| Maintenance of a fixed place solely to purchase goods or collect information | NOT a PE |
| Maintenance of a fixed place solely for any preparatory or auxiliary activity | NOT a PE |
| Maintenance of a fixed place solely for any combination of the above | NOT a PE |

**Anti-fragmentation rule (Art 5(4.1), 2017 Model):** These exclusions do NOT apply if:
- The activity is NOT of a preparatory or auxiliary character, OR
- The enterprise (or a closely related enterprise) carries on business at the same place or another place in the same state, and the combined activity is NOT preparatory/auxiliary

### Agent PE (Art 5(5)–(6))

| Type | Creates PE? | Conditions |
|------|------------|------------|
| **Dependent agent** | YES | Person habitually concludes contracts (or plays the principal role leading to conclusion without material modification) in the name of the enterprise |
| **Independent agent** | NO | Agent of independent status acting in ordinary course of business |
| **Closely related agent** | YES (per 2017 rules) | Agent acts exclusively or almost exclusively for closely related enterprises (>50% interest) — cannot be "independent" |

### 2025 Commentary update — remote work and home offices

The 2025 update to the Commentary on Article 5 provides guidance on when working from home creates a PE:

| Factor | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **Less than 50% rule** | If an individual works from a home office less than 50% of total working time over any 12-month period, this generally will NOT constitute a PE of the employer |
| **Commercial reasons test** | Even if ≥ 50%, a PE may not arise if the home office use is for the employee's convenience (not required by employer), has no commercial reason for the employer, and the employer has a suitable office available |
| **Employer-required** | If the employer requires the employee to work from home (no alternative office provided), and this exceeds 50% of working time, a PE is more likely |
| **Not a blanket rule** | The 50% threshold is an indicative guidance point in the Commentary, not a binding treaty rule — it is a factor in the overall assessment |

**Important:** The 2025 Commentary guidance only applies to treaties that are interpreted consistently with the current OECD Commentary. Older treaties may be interpreted under the Commentary in force when concluded.

## Section 3 — Article 7: Business Profits

### Model rule

> "The profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein."

### Key principles

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Exclusive residence taxation** | Business profits taxable ONLY in the residence state — unless there is a PE in the other state |
| **PE attribution** | If PE exists, the source state may tax ONLY the profits attributable to the PE |
| **Arm's length attribution** | Profits attributed to PE as if it were a separate, independent enterprise dealing at arm's length with the rest of the enterprise |
| **Expense deduction** | Expenses incurred for the PE are deductible, including executive and general administrative expenses (whether in the PE state or elsewhere) |
| **No force of attraction** | The source state cannot tax profits of the enterprise that are NOT attributable to the PE (even if the enterprise has other activities in that state) |

### Practical significance for freelancers

If a freelancer has NO PE in the client's country, business profits are taxable ONLY in the freelancer's residence country. The client's country has no right to tax under Article 7, even if the client is paying from that country.

**This is the single most important treaty article for cross-border freelancers.** Combined with the PE analysis under Article 5, it answers: "Do I owe tax in my client's country?"

---

## Section 4 — Article 12: Royalties

### Model rule (OECD position: exclusive residence-state taxation)

> "Royalties arising in a Contracting State and paid to a resident of the other Contracting State shall be taxable only in that other State if such resident is the beneficial owner of the royalties."

### OECD Model: 0% source-state WHT

Under the OECD Model, royalties are taxable **ONLY in the residence state** of the beneficial owner. The source state has no right to withhold. This is a 0% rate.

**However:** Many actual bilateral treaties deviate from the OECD Model and allow source-state WHT on royalties at negotiated rates (commonly 5%, 10%, or 15%). Always check the specific treaty.

### Definition of royalties (Art 12(2))

> "Payments of any kind received as a consideration for the use of, or the right to use, any copyright of literary, artistic or scientific work including cinematograph films, any patent, trade mark, design or model, plan, secret formula or process, or for information concerning industrial, commercial or scientific experience."

### Software payments — the contested classification

| Payment type | OECD position | Many countries' position |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| Payment for a copy of software for personal/business use | **Business profits** (Art 7) — NOT a royalty | Some countries (India, Brazil) treat as royalty |
| Payment for the right to reproduce/distribute software | **Royalty** (Art 12) | Consistent with OECD |
| Payment for a site license (limited copies) | **Business profits** (Art 7) | Contested in some jurisdictions |
| SaaS subscription (no transfer of software) | **Business profits** (Art 7) | India treats as royalty (Explanation 4 to § 9(1)(vi)) |

---

## Section 5 — Article 13: Capital Gains

### Allocation rules

| Asset type | Taxing right |
|-----------|-------------|
| Immovable property (Art 13(1)) | May be taxed in the state where the property is situated |
| Movable property of a PE (Art 13(2)) | May be taxed in the state where the PE is situated |
| Ships/aircraft in international traffic (Art 13(3)) | Taxable only in the state of effective management of the enterprise |
| Shares deriving value principally from immovable property (Art 13(4)) | May be taxed in the state where the property is situated |
| Other shares / securities (Art 13(5)) | Taxable only in the residence state of the alienator |

### Key practical points

- Art 13(4) is an anti-avoidance rule preventing the use of interposed entities to avoid taxation on real estate gains
- "Principally" means >50% of the share value derives from immovable property (in many treaties; wording varies)
- Art 13(5) means that a freelancer selling shares in a foreign company (that is NOT a property company) owes capital gains tax ONLY in their residence country — not in the company's country

---

## Section 6 — Article 14: Independent Personal Services (deleted 2000)

### Historical note

Article 14 covered income from independent personal services (freelancers, professionals). It was **deleted from the OECD Model in 2000** — such income is now covered by Article 7 (business profits).

### Why this still matters

Many existing bilateral treaties were concluded before 2000 and still contain Article 14. Under those treaties:

| Old Article 14 provision | Effect |
|--------------------------|--------|
| Income taxable only in residence state UNLESS individual has a "fixed base" regularly available in the other state | Lower threshold than PE — a "fixed base" is easier to establish than a "fixed place of business" |
| If fixed base exists → income attributable to the fixed base taxable in that state | Similar to PE attribution but under different terminology |

**Check the specific treaty.** If it has an Article 14, apply it. If it doesn't (post-2000 treaties), apply Article 7.

---

## Section 7 — Article 15: Employment Income

### Model rule

Employment income is taxable in the state where the employment is exercised — BUT a short-term exemption applies.

### Short-term assignment exemption (Art 15(2))

Employment income earned by a resident of State A for work performed in State B is taxable ONLY in State A if ALL three conditions are met:

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Days** | Employee is present in State B for not more than **183 days** in any 12-month period commencing or ending in the fiscal year concerned |
| **Employer** | Remuneration is paid by, or on behalf of, an employer who is NOT a resident of State B |
| **PE not bearing cost** | Remuneration is NOT borne by a PE which the employer has in State B |

**All three must be met.** If any one fails, State B may tax the employment income.

### 183-day counting

- The OECD Model uses a "12-month period" (rolling, not calendar year). Many actual treaties use "calendar year" or "fiscal year" instead — check the specific treaty.
- "Days of presence" includes days of arrival, departure, weekends, holidays, sick days, and any other day spent in the country (not just working days).
- A fraction of a day counts as a full day of presence.

### Practical example

UK employee sent to Germany for a project:
- Present 150 days in a 12-month period ✓ (< 183)
- Paid by UK employer (not German resident) ✓
- UK employer has no German PE ✓
→ Germany cannot tax. Only UK taxes.

If any condition fails (e.g., employee is present 190 days), Germany may tax the employment income earned there.

## Section 8 — Articles 23A/23B: Methods to Eliminate Double Taxation

### The problem

When both the residence state and source state have taxing rights (e.g., source state taxes under Art 13(1) for immovable property gains, and residence state taxes worldwide income), double taxation occurs.

### Two methods

| Method | Article | How it works | Effect |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------|
| **Exemption method** | 23A | Residence state exempts the income that the source state may tax (often with progression — the exempt income affects the rate applied to other income) | Income taxed only once, at the source-state rate |
| **Credit method** | 23B | Residence state taxes worldwide income but grants a credit for the tax paid in the source state | Income taxed at the higher of the two rates |

### Credit method — practical mechanics

1. Residence state computes tax on worldwide income (including the foreign-source income)
2. Residence state allows a credit equal to the tax paid in the source state
3. Credit is limited to the amount of residence-state tax attributable to the foreign income (no excess credit refund)
4. Excess foreign tax (where source-state rate > residence-state rate) is a real cost — not recoverable

### Which method do countries use?

| Method | Countries typically using |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Exemption (for business profits/employment) | Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg |
| Credit (general) | US, UK, Japan, Canada, Australia, India, Singapore |
| Mixed (exemption for some, credit for others) | Most EU countries (exemption for active income, credit for passive income) |

### Practical significance

- **Exemption countries** (e.g., Germany): If you pay 10% WHT in India on consulting fees, and Germany exempts the Indian income → your effective rate on that income is 10% (only India taxes)
- **Credit countries** (e.g., UK): If you pay 10% WHT in India, and UK rate on the income would be 40% → UK taxes at 40% but gives a 10% credit → effective rate is 40% (you pay 10% to India + 30% to UK)

---

## Section 9 — Article 25: Mutual Agreement Procedure (MAP)

### When MAP applies

- Taxation not in accordance with the treaty
- Difficulties in interpretation or application
- Elimination of double taxation not otherwise provided for

### Process

1. **Taxpayer initiates:** Present case to competent authority of residence state within 3 years of first notification of the taxation
2. **Competent authority attempts resolution:** If it cannot resolve unilaterally, it shall endeavour to resolve by mutual agreement with the other state
3. **No obligation to reach agreement:** Under the standard OECD Model, there is no mandatory binding arbitration
4. **Mandatory binding arbitration (Art 25(5)):** Added in 2008 update — if competent authorities cannot resolve within 2 years, either state may submit to arbitration. NOT all treaties include this.

### Timeline expectations

| Phase | Typical duration |
|-------|-----------------|
| Filing MAP request | Within 3 years of adverse tax action |
| Competent authority initial review | 3–6 months |
| Inter-state negotiation | 12–36 months |
| Arbitration (if applicable) | Additional 6–12 months |
| **Total MAP resolution** | **18–48 months** typical |

## Section 10 — Default rates table: OECD Model vs typical treaties

### OECD Model default rates (what the Model Convention says)

| Income type | Source state right | Residence state right |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Business profits (Art 7) | 0% (unless PE) | Full taxation |
| Dividends — portfolio (Art 10(2)(b)) | Max 15% WHT | Full (with credit/exemption) |
| Dividends — substantial holding ≥25% (Art 10(2)(a)) | Max 5% WHT | Full (with credit/exemption) |
| Interest (Art 11) | Max 10% WHT | Full (with credit/exemption) |
| Royalties (Art 12) | **0% (exclusive residence)** | Full taxation |
| Capital gains — immovable (Art 13(1)) | Full taxation | Credit/exemption |
| Capital gains — shares (Art 13(5)) | 0% | Full taxation |
| Employment income (Art 15) | Full if >183 days or local employer/PE | Full (with credit/exemption) |
| Pensions (Art 18) | 0% | Full taxation |
| Government service (Art 19) | Full (paying state) | Exempt (unless national of residence state) |

### What countries typically negotiate (deviations from OECD Model)

| Provision | OECD default | Common treaty deviation |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------|
| Royalties | 0% source | 5–15% source WHT (especially with developing countries) |
| Interest | 10% source | 0–15% (many developed-country treaties achieve 0%) |
| Dividends (portfolio) | 15% source | 10–15% (some achieve 0% for pension funds) |
| Dividends (substantial) | 5% source | 0–5% (EU PSD achieves 0% without treaty) |
| Construction PE | 12 months | 6–9 months in many treaties |
| Service PE | Not in OECD Model | 90–183 days (in UN-model influenced treaties) |
| Art 14 (independent services) | Deleted (2000) | Still present in pre-2000 treaties |
| Arbitration (Art 25(5)) | Optional | Increasingly included in newer treaties |

---

## Section 11 — UN Model differences

The UN Model Tax Convention deviates from the OECD Model to preserve source-state taxing rights for developing countries.

| Article | OECD Model | UN Model Difference |
|---------|-----------|---------------------|
| Art 5 (PE) | No service PE | **Service PE at 183 days in 12 months** (Art 5(3)(b)) — service PE triggered by furnishing services through employees or other personnel |
| Art 12 (Royalties) | 0% source (exclusive residence) | **Source state MAY tax** royalties — rate negotiated bilaterally |
| Art 12A (Fees for Technical Services) | Does not exist | **NEW article** — source state may tax fees for technical services (added 2017 UN update). Rate negotiated. |
| Art 13 (Capital Gains) | Only immovable + PE assets in source | **Broader source-state rights** on share sales |
| Art 14 (Independent Services) | Deleted | **Retained** — allows source taxation if individual has a "fixed base" OR is present >183 days |

### Practical impact

When a freelancer in a developed country (e.g., UK) works for a client in a developing country (e.g., India), the treaty between them is likely **UN-model influenced** — meaning:
- Service PE thresholds are lower (90 days in India's treaties)
- Source-state WHT on services may apply (India: 10% on technical/professional services)
- Article 12A (fees for technical services) may give India taxing rights even without PE

Always check the specific bilateral treaty to determine which model it follows.

## Section 12 — Using this skill with other cross-border skills

### Interaction with `withholding-tax-matrix.md`

The WHT matrix provides specific rates for specific country pairs. This skill provides the default OECD framework. When they interact:
- Treaty rates in the WHT matrix override the OECD Model defaults (because they are the actual negotiated rates)
- For country pairs NOT in the WHT matrix, use the OECD Model default as the starting assumption, then verify against the actual treaty text

### Interaction with `permanent-establishment-risk.md`

The PE risk skill provides practical assessment guidance. This skill provides the treaty-law framework (Art 5 definition). When they interact:
- Use Article 5 from this skill for the legal test
- Use the PE risk skill for practical risk assessment and country-specific thresholds

### Interaction with `tax-residency-planning.md`

The residency planning skill provides country-specific domestic rules. This skill provides the treaty tie-breaker (Art 4(2)). When they interact:
- Country skill determines whether domestic law claims the person as resident
- If two countries BOTH claim → this skill's Art 4(2) cascade applies

### Interaction with `cross-border-workflow-base.md`

The orchestrator calls this skill in Steps 4, 5, and 7 of the cross-border workflow:
- Step 4 (residency): Art 4 tie-breaker
- Step 5 (PE assessment): Art 5 definition
- Step 7 (WHT): Art 10–12 default rates

---

## PROHIBITIONS

1. **NEVER** assume a specific bilateral treaty matches the OECD Model exactly. All treaties are negotiated and many deviate significantly.
2. **NEVER** apply Article 14 (independent services) unless the specific treaty still contains it. It was deleted from the OECD Model in 2000.
3. **NEVER** assume the 183-day rule uses a "12-month period" — many treaties use "calendar year" or "fiscal year."
4. **NEVER** ignore the 2017/2025 updates when interpreting PE risk — the anti-fragmentation rule and remote-work Commentary are critical for modern work arrangements.
5. **NEVER** assume royalties are 0% in the source state without checking the specific treaty. The OECD Model says 0%, but most actual treaties allow some source WHT.
6. **NEVER** advise that MAP resolves quickly. Typical timeframes are 18–48 months.
7. **NEVER** treat the OECD Model as binding law. It is a template that countries use to negotiate bilateral treaties. The treaty itself is the law.
