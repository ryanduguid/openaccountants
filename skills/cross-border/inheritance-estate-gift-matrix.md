# Inheritance / Estate / Gift Tax Matrix v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `cross-border-workflow-base`.** It maps the world's principal transfer taxes on death and gift, as of mid-2025.

**Tax year coverage.** Current for **calendar 2025**, reflecting:
- **US OBBBA** (P.L. 119-21, July 2025) — confirms unified gift / estate / GST exemption at USD 13.99m (2025), rising to ~USD 15m per OBBBA's permanent extension of TCJA increase
- **UK IHT** — frozen nil-rate band at GBP 325,000 and residence nil-rate band at GBP 175,000 through April 2030; **domicile concept replaced by long-term residence from 6 April 2025** under FA 2025
- **German Erbschaftsteuer** — Bundesfinanzhof July 2024 ruling on business property relief constitutionality; rates and brackets per ErbStG as last amended
- **French droits de succession** — unchanged rates; Pacte Dutreil at 75% reduction
- **Spanish ISD** — strong regional variation; some autonomous communities (Andalucía, Madrid) effectively reduce to 0% via rebates; national surcharge mechanics
- **Italian successioni** — generous spouse / child exemptions; ongoing parliamentary discussion of rate increases

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** Cross-border succession is one of the most error-prone areas of practice. Every output must be reviewed by a credentialed local tax / estate planning practitioner before any return is filed.

## Section 2 — United States (federal estate, gift, GST)

### 2.1 Unified exemption (2025)

**[T1] Per OBBBA (P.L. 119-21):**
- Basic exclusion amount (BEA): **USD 13,990,000** per individual (2025)
- **Rising to ~USD 15,000,000** under OBBBA's permanent extension (from 2026)
- Married couple portability: surviving spouse can use deceased spouse's unused exclusion (DSUE)
- Generation-skipping transfer (GST) exemption: same amount

### 2.2 Rate

**[T1]** Flat top rate **40%** above the exemption (graduated brackets 18-40% but most transfers hit the top rate due to lifetime exhaustion of lower brackets via prior gifts).

### 2.3 Annual gift exclusion

- **USD 19,000** per donor per donee for 2025 (indexed)
- **USD 190,000** spousal annual exclusion for non-US-citizen spouse (2025; raised from USD 175k)
- Educational and medical exclusion: unlimited if paid directly to institution

### 2.4 Marital and charitable deductions

- Unlimited marital deduction for US citizen spouse
- Unlimited charitable deduction for qualified §501(c)(3) recipients

### 2.5 Non-US residents (estate)

**[T1] Non-resident aliens (NRAs):**
- US-situs assets subject to estate tax (real estate in US, US-domiciled corporation shares including foreign corporation US-business income, tangible personal property in US)
- **Exemption: only USD 60,000** (treaty may increase)
- Top rate 40%
- Treaties exist with: Australia, Austria, Canada (under §2056A protocol), Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, UK

### 2.6 Filing

- Form 709 — Gift
- Filing deadline: 9 months from date of death (estate); 15 April following year of gift
- DSUE election: must be made on a Form 706 even if no tax due

### 2.7 Step-up in basis (income tax interaction)

**[T1] §1014:** inherited assets receive a step-up in basis to FMV at date of death. Critical for capital gains planning. Note: some carryover basis rules apply where modified estate tax regime elected.

---

## Section 3 — United Kingdom — Inheritance Tax (IHT)

### 3.1 Major reform: domicile → long-term residence (6 April 2025)

**[T1] FA 2025 replaced domicile with a long-term residence (LTR) test:**

- **Long-term residents are subject to IHT on worldwide assets** for 10 years after losing LTR status
- **Non-LTR individuals**: IHT on UK-situs assets only

Previously, non-UK domiciled individuals could shelter foreign assets via "excluded property trusts" — these largely lose their effectiveness for individuals settling after 6 April 2025.

**[T1]**
- **Nil-rate band (NRB)**: GBP 325,000 (frozen through April 2030)

- **Charitable exemption**: unlimited
- **Standard rate**: 40% above NRB (and RNRB) — reduced to **36%** if 10%+ of net estate goes to charity
- **Lifetime gift rate**: 20% (if chargeable lifetime transfer); 40% on death within 7 years subject to taper (the "7-year rule")

### 3.3 Reliefs

- **Agricultural Property Relief (APR)**: 100% for owner-occupied farmland (50% for tenanted); **post-April 2026 cap of GBP 1m of combined APR + BPR before the rate halves**
- **Business Property Relief (BPR)**: 100% for unquoted trading business shares; 50% for quoted controlling shareholdings; **same GBP 1m cap from April 2026**
- **Quick succession relief**: tapered for transfers within 5 years

### 3.4 Filing

- Form IHT400 (estate exceeding NRB)
- Form IHT205 (smaller estates)
- IHT due 6 months from end of month of death
- Form C5 for Scotland confirmation

### 10.1 Situs rules (general)

**[T1]** Most jurisdictions tax:
- Worldwide assets if the deceased was a tax/domicile resident
- Local-situs assets only if non-resident/non-domiciled
- Real estate ALWAYS at situs (regardless of deceased's residence) per most treaty practice

### 10.2 Common situs definitions

|---|---|
| Real estate | Country where land is located |
| Tangible movable | Country where located at date of death/gift |
| Shares in companies | Country of company's incorporation OR country of share register |
| Bank accounts | Country where bank is located |
| Government bonds | Country issuing the bonds |
| Private equity / unlisted shares | Country of company's residence |
| Cash | Country where cash is held |
| Crypto-assets | Highly debated; commonly attributed to deceased's residence |

### 10.3 Double taxation treaties

2. **Asset inventory** by situs with valuation methodology and supporting documentation
3. **Beneficiary inventory** with relationship classification per jurisdiction
4. **Exemption / allowance schedule** per applicable jurisdiction
5. **Relief schedule** — Agricultural Property Relief, Business Property Relief, Pacte Dutreil, German Verschonung, US marital deduction
6. **Tax computation** per jurisdiction
7. **Double taxation analysis** — credits available, treaty article references
8. **Filing deadlines and forms** per jurisdiction
9. **Step-up in basis analysis** for US-citizen beneficiaries (income tax consequence)
10. **Reviewer questions** — open items flagged as [T2] or [T3]

---

## Section 12 — Self-checks

- [ ] Domicile / LTR / residence tested per each jurisdiction's specific definition
- [ ] Asset situs determined per each jurisdiction's rules, not assumed by analogy
- [ ] Relationship classification per jurisdiction (Class I-IV in DE; Group I-IV in ES)
- [ ] Exemptions per jurisdiction applied to net not gross
- [ ] Business property reliefs verified for qualifying conditions (active business, holding period, payroll)
- [ ] Charitable and spousal deductions confirmed
- [ ] Treaty foreign tax credits applied where bilateral treaty exists
- [ ] Filing forms and deadlines per jurisdiction plotted
- [ ] US step-up basis recorded for beneficiary income tax planning
- [ ] Output flags every [T2]/[T3] item for reviewer judgement

---

## Section 13 — Prohibitions

- **Do not** assume a country exempts inheritance because there is "no estate tax" — many countries instead tax inherited gains via income tax (Canada deemed disposition; Australia CGT on death).
- **Do not** apply pre-FA-2025 UK domicile rules to FY 2025/26 cases — long-term residence applies from 6 April 2025.
- **Do not** treat Spanish ISD as eliminated nationally because Madrid exempts it — regional variation is the rule, not the exception.
- **Do not** claim US estate tax exemption of USD 13.99m for a non-resident alien — NRA exemption is only USD 60k (treaty-modifiable).
- **Do not** apply Pacte Dutreil or German Verschonung without confirming the holding-period and payroll commitments are sustainable post-transmission.
