## Core Decision: Do You Need to Collect Tax from Customers?

The answer depends on three factors:

1. **WHERE** is the customer located?
2. **WHAT** are you selling (digital product, SaaS, physical goods, consulting)?
3. **HOW MUCH** do you sell into that jurisdiction?

---

## Compliance Strategy by Revenue Level

| Revenue Level | Recommendation | Estimated Cost |
|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| <€10,000 from any single jurisdiction | Monitor only — below most thresholds | $0 |
| €10,000–€100,000 with global customers | Use a Merchant of Record (Paddle, Lemon Squeezy) — they handle all tax | 5–10% of revenue |
| >€100,000 with concentrated markets | Self-register in top 2–3 markets + Stripe Tax for automation | $2,000–5,000/year in accounting |

### Merchant of Record (MoR) Decision Framework

| Revenue | Complexity Tolerance | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------------|----------------|
| <$50,000 | Any | MoR (Paddle / Lemon Squeezy) |
| $50,000–$200,000 | Low | MoR |
| $50,000–$200,000 | High | Self-register top markets + Stripe Tax |
| >$200,000 | Any | Self-register + accountant + Stripe Tax |

**MoR services (Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, FastSpring)** act as the legal seller:
- They collect VAT/GST from customers
- They file and remit VAT to each country
- You receive net payment
- Cost: 5–10% of revenue (includes payment processing)

---

## EU VAT (Value Added Tax)

### When It Applies

- Selling digital products/services (SaaS, ebooks, courses, software) to EU consumers (B2C)
- Applies regardless of where YOUR company is registered
- Threshold: **€10,000/year** in total EU B2C sales → must register

### EU VAT Rates (Digital Services)

| Country | Standard Rate |
|---------|---------------|
| Germany | 19% |
| France | 20% |
| Netherlands | 21% |
| Spain | 21% |
| Italy | 22% |
| Ireland | 23% |
| Sweden | 25% |

### VAT OSS (One-Stop Shop)

- Register in ONE EU country → report all EU B2C sales through one portal
- No need to register in each country separately
- Available to non-EU businesses via "Non-Union OSS" scheme
- File quarterly returns

### B2B Sales to EU

- If the EU customer provides a valid VAT number → **reverse charge** (0% VAT; customer self-assesses)
- Always validate EU VAT numbers via VIES system before zero-rating
- URL: https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/

---

## UK VAT

### When It Applies

- Selling digital services to UK consumers (B2C)
- **No threshold for non-UK businesses** — must register from first sale
- UK businesses: £90,000 threshold

### UK VAT Rate

- **20%** standard rate

---

## US Sales Tax

### When It Applies

- Selling to US customers (digital or physical)
- "Nexus" required: physical presence OR **economic nexus**
- Economic nexus: most states trigger at **$100,000 in sales OR 200 transactions/year**

### Key Facts

- US has NO federal sales tax — it is state-by-state (45 states + DC)
- Digital products/SaaS taxability varies by state:
  - **Taxable in:** TX, NY, PA, WA, and ~20 others
  - **Not taxable in:** CA (SaaS), GA, MO, and others
- If you have no US nexus: you may not need to collect (rules evolving)

## Digital Services Tax (DST) — NOT the Same as VAT

DST is a revenue-based tax on digital services. Unlike VAT (transaction-level, charged to customers) and corporate tax (profit-based), DST is calculated on gross revenue and comes out of your own revenue.

### DST Rates and Thresholds

| Country | DST Rate | Global Revenue Threshold | Local Revenue Threshold |
|---------|----------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| UK | 2% | £500M global | £25M UK |
| France | 3% | €750M global | €25M France |
| Italy | 3% | €750M global | €5.5M Italy |
| Spain | 3% | €750M global | €3M Spain |
| Turkey | 7.5% | €750M global | TRY 20M Turkey |
| India (Equalization Levy) | 2% | **No threshold** | ₹2 crore (~$240K) |
| Kenya | 1.5% | **No threshold** | KES 0 (all digital services) |

**For most small businesses:** The high global revenue thresholds in Europe (£500M, €750M) make DST irrelevant.

**Exceptions — India and Kenya have NO global revenue threshold:**
- **India Equalization Levy:** 2% on gross consideration for non-resident e-commerce operators selling digital services to Indian customers. Must register and file quarterly.
- **Kenya Digital Service Tax:** 1.5% on gross transaction value. No minimum threshold.

| Your India/Kenya Revenue | Action |
|--------------------------|--------|
| <$10,000/year | Monitor; enforcement limited at this scale |
| $10,000–$50,000/year | Consult tax advisor; weigh registration cost vs exposure |
| >$50,000/year | Register and comply; enforcement risk is real |

---

## Penalties and Remediation

### Late Registration Penalties

Most EU countries impose penalties for selling above the €10,000 threshold without registration:
- **Minimum penalty:** ~€500 (small/first-time violation)
- **Maximum penalty:** ~5% of unpaid VAT (sustained non-compliance)
- Interest accrues from the date VAT was originally due

### Voluntary Disclosure Programs

| Jurisdiction | Program | Penalty Reduction |
|--------------|---------|-------------------|
| EU (most countries) | Voluntary correction | 50–75% reduction |
| UK | Unprompted disclosure to HMRC | Best terms (~30% of maximum) |
| Australia | Voluntary disclosure | Significant reduction; no penalty if minor |
| US | Voluntary Disclosure Programs (VDP) | Varies by state; generally 50%+ reduction |

**"Unprompted" means you contact the authority before they contact you.** Once an audit begins, voluntary disclosure terms are lost.

### Remediation Steps

1. Stop selling into the affected jurisdiction until registered (or switch to MoR immediately)
2. Calculate total VAT owed retroactively from the date the threshold was crossed
3. File voluntary disclosure with the relevant tax authority
4. Pay outstanding VAT + reduced penalty + accrued interest
5. Register going forward through standard process

### When to Get Professional Help

If total exposure exceeds **€5,000** or involves **multiple countries**, hire a VAT specialist. Typical remediation cost: €500–2,000 per engagement — almost always cheaper than the penalties avoided.

## Physical Goods — Key Differences from Digital Services

| Dimension | Digital Services | Physical Goods |
|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Delivery | Instant, borderless | Shipping, customs clearance |
| VAT trigger | Customer location | Import entry |
| Additional taxes | DST (rare) | Customs duty, tariffs |
| Complexity | Medium | High |

### EU Physical Goods (Post-2021)

- **No de minimis exemption** — ALL imports subject to VAT (was €22 before 2021)
- Customs duty threshold: €150 still applies
- **IOSS (Import One-Stop Shop):** Lets non-EU sellers collect and remit VAT at point of sale for goods <€150. Without IOSS, carrier or customs collects VAT from buyer on delivery (poor customer experience).

### US De Minimis (Section 321)

- Shipments ≤**$800 USD** per day per importer: exempt from customs duty
- Above $800: customs duty + potential tariffs apply
- Threshold under legislative review — verify before building logistics around it

---

## Platform Income — VAT Threshold Aggregation

If earning across multiple platforms (YouTube, Patreon, Substack, Gumroad), **aggregate total EU digital services revenue** for VAT threshold purposes:

- EU VAT OSS threshold: **€10,000/year** across ALL EU B2C digital sales (not per platform)
- Gumroad and Paddle handle VAT for their platform sales (they are MoR)
- Stripe, Patreon, and AdSense do NOT handle VAT — the seller is responsible
