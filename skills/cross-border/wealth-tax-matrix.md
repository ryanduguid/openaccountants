  Use this skill whenever an individual asks about annual net wealth tax exposure. Trigger on phrases like "wealth tax", "net worth tax", "ISP (impôt sur la fortune immobilière)", "IFI", "patrimoine", "patrimonio", "Vermögensteuer", "Solidaritetsskatt", "formueskatt", "förmögenhetsskatt", "Swiss wealth tax", "Norway wealth tax", "Spain wealth tax", "Spain solidarity tax", "patrimonio extraordinaria", "Madrid wealth tax exemption", "Argentinian bienes personales", "Colombian impuesto al patrimonio", "Uruguay impuesto al patrimonio", or any request to compute net wealth tax. Maps in-force annual net wealth tax regimes as of mid-2025 in Switzerland (cantonal), Norway, Spain (national IP + regional + Impuesto Temporal de Solidaridad), Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, the Netherlands (Box 3 fictitious yield as wealth-tax-equivalent), and France (IFI on real estate only). Identifies regimes recently repealed (Italy IVAFE/IVIE remain narrow asset-specific; full wealth tax repealed long ago) and proposed wealth taxes (UK, US §2901 proposals, Brazil). Does NOT cover: inheritance / estate / gift tax (see inheritance-estate-gift-matrix), property transfer tax (see property-transfer-tax-matrix), wealth-related taxes on specific assets (Italy IVIE/IVAFE — see Italian skill). ALWAYS read this skill before computing net wealth tax in an in-force jurisdiction.

# Net Wealth Tax Matrix v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `cross-border-workflow-base`.** It maps every in-force annual net wealth tax as of mid-2025.

**Tax year coverage.** Current for **calendar 2025**, reflecting:
- **Spain Impuesto Temporal de Solidaridad** extended into 2025 as a temporary national surcharge on net wealth ≥ EUR 3m, neutralising regional rebates (Madrid, Andalucía)
- **Norwegian wealth tax** rates updated; municipal portion 0.7% + state portion graduated 0.4%/0.6%/1.0%
- **Swiss cantonal wealth tax** rates by canton with substantial variation (Geneva ~1% top; Schwyz, Nidwalden ~0.2%)
- **Argentina Bienes Personales** with the new "Plan Aporte Especial" and PPP/Mileiomy-era reductions through Law 27.743
- **Colombia Impuesto al Patrimonio** as restructured under Law 2277 of 2022
- **Netherlands Box 3** in transition (constitutional challenge: HR 6 June 2024 effectively forces actual-return based system; transitional law in force 2025 with calculation methods)
- **France IFI** unchanged (real-estate-only since 2018 replacement of the ISF)

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** Wealth tax valuation and exemptions are highly fact-specific. Every output must be reviewed by a credentialed local tax practitioner.

## Section 2 — Spain

### 2.1 Three-layer wealth tax stack

**[T1] Layer 1 — Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio (IP) — national framework + autonomous community administration:**
- Ley 19/1991 — national law
- Each Comunidad Autónoma sets rates, brackets, and rebates
- Effective rates: Catalonia ~0.21-2.75%; Madrid 100% rebate (effectively 0%); Andalucía 100% rebate (effectively 0%); Galicia ~0.2-2.5%; others vary
- Tax-free minimum (national default): EUR 700,000 (autonomous communities may modify)
- Habitual residence exemption: EUR 300,000 per taxpayer

**[T1] Layer 2 — Impuesto Temporal de Solidaridad de las Grandes Fortunas:**
- Introduced 28 December 2022 (Ley 38/2022) as "temporary" with sunset at end of 2024; **extended through 2025 by RDL 9/2024**
- National tax on net wealth ≥ EUR 3 million; effectively neutralises regional rebates
- Rates: 0% to EUR 3m; 1.7% from EUR 3m-5.347m; 2.1% from EUR 5.347m-10.696m; 3.5% above EUR 10.696m
- Credit for IP paid in the autonomous community

**[T1] Layer 3 — Combined cap:** total of personal income tax (IRPF) + IP + Solidaridad cannot exceed 60% of IRPF taxable base; cap excluded if assets are mostly non-productive

### 2.2 Computation example

A Madrid resident with EUR 8m net wealth:
- IP at Madrid 100% rebate → EUR 0
- Solidaridad: (5.347m − 3m) × 1.7% + (8m − 5.347m) × 2.1% = EUR 39,899 + EUR 55,713 = **EUR 95,612**
- IRPF + Solidaridad capped at 60% of IRPF base

A Catalonia resident with EUR 8m net wealth:
- IP at Catalonia top rate ~2.75% above EUR 10.7m (sub-cap brackets apply); estimate IP ≈ EUR 130,000
- Solidaridad: gross EUR 95,612 − IP paid EUR 130,000 = floor at 0; **net Solidaridad EUR 0**
- The Solidaridad cancels regional rebate effects

### 2.3 Exemptions

| Exemption | Detail |
|---|---|
| Family business shares | Exempt if ≥5% direct ownership (or 20% group), held actively, directing functions |
| Habitual residence | First EUR 300k per taxpayer |
| Family heirlooms | Items of historical / artistic value classified |
| Author's IP rights | When inalienable |
| Pension rights | Defined-benefit, occupational pensions |

### 2.4 Filing

- Form 714 (IP) and Form 718 (Solidaridad)
- Due May-June following calendar year
- Tax base reference date: 31 December
- Online filing mandatory above thresholds

## Section 9 — Netherlands — Box 3 (de facto wealth tax via fictitious yield)

**[T1] Netherlands Box 3 — wealth taxed via deemed yield rather than rate on capital:**

The **Hoge Raad** judgment of 6 June 2024 confirmed the existing fictitious-yield system unconstitutional where it exceeds actual return. The transitional Box 3 system in force from 2023 onwards (with retroactive cures) computes a deemed yield:

```
Deemed yield = (allocated % × yield rate per asset class) − allocated debt × debt yield rate
Box 3 tax = Deemed yield × 36% (2024/2025 rate, up from 32% in 2023)
```

**[T1] Asset class yields (2025 illustrative):**
- Bank deposits: ~1.03%
- Other assets (real estate, shares, crypto, foreign accounts): ~6.04%
- Debt yield: ~2.47%

**[T1] Tax-free allowance:** EUR 57,000 per taxpayer / EUR 114,000 fiscal partners

**[T1]** Effective wealth tax rate on "other assets":
6.04% × 36% = **2.17%** (top range; on actual return-bearing assets that perform below the deemed yield, effective rate is higher)

**[T2]** Taxpayers can elect actual-yield computation (counter-proof) from 2025; complex documentation required. Permanent reform expected 2027-2028 to align with actual yield.

## Section 10 — Recently changed / proposed

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|---|---|
| **Italy** | No general wealth tax. IVIE (0.76% on foreign real estate) and IVAFE (0.2% on foreign financial assets) remain asset-specific. Long-term ISA proposals for super-rich resurface periodically. |
| **Germany** | Wealth tax (Vermögensteuer) suspended since 1997 (BVerfG ruling). Periodic SPD/Greens proposals; not in force as of 2025. |
| **United Kingdom** | No annual wealth tax. Wealth Tax Commission 2020 recommended a one-off 5% wealth tax above £500k; no enactment. 2024 Labour government rejected an annual wealth tax. |
| **United States** | No federal annual wealth tax. State-level proposals (California AB 259, New York AB 6010); proposed federal Warren/Sanders bills (§2901-2902 ITA) have not advanced. Senator Wyden's billionaire tax (proposed mark-to-market on unrealised gains) is conceptually distinct but related. |
| **Brazil** | No general wealth tax. CSLL on net profits applies to companies. Proposed Imposto sobre Grandes Fortunas (CF Art. 153 §VII) authorised by Constitution but never enacted. PEC 162/2022 proposal pending. |
| **Belgium** | No general wealth tax. **Securities Account Tax (Taxe sur les comptes-titres / TCT)** at 0.15% above EUR 1m per holder per account introduced 2021. |
| **Hungary** | No general wealth tax. Property tax (építményadó) and similar local taxes only. |
| **Iceland** | Wealth tax (auðlegðarskattur) abolished 2014. |
| **Sweden** | Wealth tax abolished 2007. |
| **Denmark** | Wealth tax abolished 1997. |
| **Finland** | Wealth tax abolished 2006. |

## Section 11 — Cross-border issues

### 11.1 Worldwide vs territorial scope

- **Spain, France IFI**: worldwide for residents; Spanish-/French-situs only for non-residents
- **Norway**: worldwide for residents; Norwegian-situs only for non-residents (limited)
- **Switzerland (cantonal)**: worldwide for residents (rate determination); cantonal-situs only for non-residents
- **Argentina Bienes Personales**: worldwide for residents (with foreign-asset surcharge); Argentine-situs only for non-residents
- **Netherlands Box 3**: worldwide for residents; Dutch-situs only for non-residents

### 11.2 Double taxation relief

Few tax treaties contain wealth tax articles. Where present (e.g., OECD Model Article 22):
- Real estate taxed in the situs state
- Business property of a PE taxed in the PE state
- Ships and aircraft taxed in the residence state of the operator
- All other property taxed in the residence state of the holder

**[T2]** In practice, double wealth taxation often results because neither state cedes primary right. Foreign tax credits available where bilateral treaty includes Article 22 (e.g., Norway-Switzerland).

### 11.3 Lex Beckham / impatriate regimes

- **Spain — Régimen Beckham**: impatriates may opt for non-resident taxation for 6 years; **IP and Solidaridad** still apply on Spanish-situs assets only during election
- **Italy — Impatriate regime**: income tax preferential; no wealth tax in Italy (n/a)
- **Portugal — NHR (closed to new applicants 2024)**: no wealth tax

## Section 12 — Output specification

The reviewer brief must include:

1. **Tax base computation** at reference date with asset class valuation methodology
2. **Debt deduction schedule** with documentation status
3. **Exemption schedule** per regime
4. **Rate application** and tax due per regime
5. **Cap computations** (Spain 60%/income cap; France IFI 75%/income cap)

7. **Cross-border tax credits** where applicable
8. **Reviewer questions** — open items flagged as [T2] or [T3]

---

## Section 13 — Self-checks

- [ ] Reference date applied (31 December typical)
- [ ] All assets valued per regime methodology (FMV vs official assessed value)
- [ ] Debts only deducted where regime allows
- [ ] Exemptions for family business / habitual home / pension applied
- [ ] Rate schedule applied to net taxable wealth (not gross)
- [ ] Caps applied (Spain 60%; France 75%)

- [ ] Filing form and deadline per regime
- [ ] Output flags every [T2]/[T3] item for reviewer judgement

---

## Section 14 — Prohibitions

- **Do not** assume an asset is exempt because the country generally exempts family businesses — specific tests (≥5% ownership, active role) apply.
- **Do not** deduct foreign-bank debt against Uruguayan or Spanish wealth tax bases — restrictions apply.
- **Do not** treat the Madrid 100% IP rebate as eliminating all Spanish wealth tax — the Solidaridad surcharge applies.
- **Do not** ignore the December 31 reference date — wealth tax is a snapshot, not an average.
- **Do not** apply ISF rules to French clients — ISF was repealed in 2018; only IFI (real estate only) remains.
