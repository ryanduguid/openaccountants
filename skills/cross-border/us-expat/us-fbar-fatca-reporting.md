# US Foreign-Account Reporting — FBAR & FATCA v0.1

## What this file is

This is a **topic content skill**. It loads on top of `cross-border-tax-workflow-base`
and assumes the cross-border router has already run, identified the taxpayer as a
**US person**, and confirmed the presence of foreign financial accounts and/or
foreign assets. It does not re-derive residency or US-person status; consume those
from the router's working paper.

It produces a **working paper** and a **reviewer brief** describing which reporting
regimes are triggered and why. It is **not** advice, **not** a filed FBAR, and
**not** a filed return. A licensed accountant signs off before anything is filed.

Two distinct regimes are in scope, governed by different bodies of law and filed in
different places. They overlap but **neither satisfies the other**:

- **FBAR** — FinCEN Form 114, filed electronically with **FinCEN** (the Financial
  Crimes Enforcement Network) through the BSA E-Filing System, **not** the IRS and
  **not** attached to the Form 1040. Statutory basis: Bank Secrecy Act,
  **31 USC §5314**; regulation **31 CFR 1010.350**.
- **FATCA** — **Form 8938**, *Statement of Specified Foreign Financial Assets*,
  filed **with the Form 1040** under **IRC §6038D**.

---

## Layer A — Reference layer (decision trees)

Each rule cites the form or statute that controls it. When a threshold figure is
involved, **confirm the current-year figure against the live IRS/FinCEN instructions
before relying on it** — do not treat any number below as authoritative for the
filing year.

### A1. Is the taxpayer a "US person"? (gate for both regimes)

- A US person includes US citizens, US resident aliens (green-card or
  substantial-presence), and certain US entities/trusts/estates (31 CFR 1010.350(b)
  for FBAR; IRC §6038D and 8938 instructions for FATCA). If the router has **not**
  confirmed US-person status, stop and resolve that first — neither regime applies
  to a non-US person.

### A2. FBAR decision tree (31 USC §5314 / 31 CFR 1010.350)

1. Does the US person have a **financial interest in** OR **signature authority over**
   one or more **foreign financial accounts**? (Bank, securities, brokerage, certain
   foreign-issued insurance/annuity with cash value, certain foreign mutual funds.)
   - No → FBAR not required on those facts.
   - Yes → continue.
2. Did the **aggregate** maximum value of **all** such accounts **exceed US$10,000
   at any point** during the calendar year?
   - **This is an aggregate-across-all-accounts test, evaluated at the highest balance
     each account reached during the year — NOT a per-account test.** Five accounts of
     $3,000 each trip the threshold even though no single account exceeds $10,000.
   - No → FBAR not required.
   - Yes → **FBAR required** (FinCEN Form 114), reporting **every** qualifying account,
     including signature-authority-only accounts.
3. Deadline: **April 15**, with an **automatic extension to October 15** (no separate
   extension request needed for the FBAR).

### A3. FATCA / Form 8938 decision tree (IRC §6038D)

1. Does the US person hold **specified foreign financial assets (SFFAs)**? SFFAs are
   **broader than FBAR-reportable accounts** — they include foreign financial accounts
   **plus** foreign stock or securities **held outside an account**, interests in
   foreign entities, and foreign financial instruments held for investment.
   - No → Form 8938 not required.
   - Yes → continue.
2. Does the aggregate value of SFFAs exceed the **filing-status- and residency-specific
   threshold**? Thresholds are **higher than the $10,000 FBAR threshold** and differ
   for taxpayers **living abroad** vs **living in the US**:
   - Illustrative (living **abroad**) — **confirm exact current-year figures**:
     - Single / married-filing-separately: **> $200,000 on the last day** of the year
       **or > $300,000 at any time** during the year.
     - Married-filing-jointly: **> $400,000 last day or > $600,000 any time**.
   - US-resident thresholds are **lower** than the abroad thresholds. **Do not hardcode —
     pull the exact figures from the current Form 8938 instructions.**
   - Below threshold → Form 8938 not required.
   - At/above threshold → **Form 8938 required**, filed **with the 1040**.
3. Deadline: with the income tax return, **including extensions** (Form 8938 follows the
   1040 due date, unlike the standalone FBAR deadline).

### A4. Overlap rule

Many assets — e.g. a foreign brokerage account — are reportable on **both** FBAR and
Form 8938. **Filing one does not discharge the obligation to file the other.** Map each
asset to both regimes independently.

---

## Layer B — Executable layer

**Input:** a list of foreign accounts/assets, each with: type, institution, country,
financial-interest vs signature-authority, max balance during year (in account
currency), year-end balance, and the USD-converted equivalents.

**Procedure:**

1. **Normalize to USD.** Convert each account's **maximum** balance and **year-end**
   balance to USD using the Treasury year-end exchange rate (or a documented published
   rate). Record the rate and source in the working paper.
2. **FBAR test.** Sum the **maximum** USD balances across all foreign **financial
   accounts** (financial interest + signature authority).
   - If aggregate **> $10,000** → flag **FBAR required**; list every qualifying account,
     marking signature-authority-only ones.
3. **FATCA test.** Identify which holdings are **SFFAs** (superset of FBAR accounts —
   add foreign stock/securities held outside an account, foreign-entity interests).
   - Determine the taxpayer's **filing status** and **abroad vs US** residency from the
     router output.
   - Look up the **current-year** Form 8938 threshold pair (last-day / any-time) for that
     status+residency. **Do not rely on the illustrative numbers in A3 — confirm them.**
   - Apply **both** the last-day test (year-end aggregate) and the any-time test
     (peak aggregate). Tripping **either** triggers Form 8938.
4. **Deadlines.** Set FBAR to **Oct 15** (auto-extended) and Form 8938 to the **1040 due
   date including extensions**.
5. **Output the reviewer brief:** which forms are required, which thresholds were tripped
   and by how much, the list of accounts/assets mapped to each regime (noting the overlap),
   FX rates used, and any open items requiring counsel (willfulness, pension treatment,
   signature-authority edge cases).

If the taxpayer is **below all thresholds**, still document the test and the margin —
near-threshold cases should be re-checked, and **conservative posture is: when genuinely
unsure whether an item counts or whether a threshold is tripped, file.**

## Comparison table — FBAR vs Form 8938

| Dimension        | FBAR (FinCEN Form 114)                                   | FATCA (Form 8938)                                                |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Legal basis      | Bank Secrecy Act, 31 USC §5314 / 31 CFR 1010.350        | IRC §6038D                                                        |
| Where filed      | FinCEN, via BSA E-Filing (separate from the return)     | Attached **to the Form 1040**                                    |
| Who files        | US persons with financial interest **or signature authority** | US persons holding specified foreign financial assets       |
| Threshold        | Aggregate **> $10,000** at **any time** (all accounts)  | Higher, varies by **filing status** and **abroad vs US** (confirm current-year figures) |
| What counts      | Foreign **financial accounts**                          | **SFFAs** — broader: accounts **plus** foreign stock/securities held outside an account, foreign-entity interests |

| Penalty regime   | Non-willful vs willful (see below); civil + potential criminal | §6038D penalties (e.g., failure-to-file + continuation; understatement penalties) |

---

## Penalties (FBAR)

- **Non-willful:** a civil penalty applies per failure. Per **Bittner v. United States,
  598 U.S. 250 (2023)**, the non-willful penalty is assessed **per-report (per annual
  FBAR form), not per-account** — a single late FBAR listing many accounts is one
  non-willful violation, not one per account.
- **Willful:** materially higher — up to the **greater of $100,000 or 50% of the account
  balance**, assessed **per violation**, plus potential criminal exposure.
- Whether conduct is willful or non-willful is a **legal determination requiring counsel**;
  do not characterize it in the working paper beyond flagging it as an open item.

---

## Remediation paths (non-willful past non-compliance)

For a US person who failed to file in prior years, the standard paths for
**non-willful** conduct are:

- **Streamlined Filing Compliance Procedures** — **Streamlined Foreign Offshore**
  (taxpayer meets a non-residency / abroad test) or **Streamlined Domestic Offshore**
  (US-resident). Requires amended/delinquent returns, delinquent FBARs, and a
  **non-willful certification**.
- **Delinquent FBAR Submission Procedures** — where the income was reported and tax paid
  but FBARs were simply not filed; file the delinquent FBARs with a reasonable-cause
  statement.

Describe these at a **high level only**. **Path selection turns on a willfulness analysis,
which requires professional/legal judgement and frequently counsel.** Do not certify
non-willfulness or recommend a streamlined submission without that review.

---

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — Willfulness.** Never label conduct willful or non-willful in the
> working paper. It drives both penalty exposure and remediation-path eligibility and is a
> legal call for counsel. Flag it as an open item; do not resolve it.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — Signature-authority-only accounts.** Accounts the taxpayer can
> direct but does not own (employer accounts, accounts they manage for others) are
> **FBAR-reportable** even with no financial interest. Easy to miss; capture them.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — Foreign pensions.** Whether a foreign pension or retirement plan
> is FBAR- and/or 8938-reportable depends on the plan's structure (account-style vs
> entity interest) and any treaty position. Do not assume it is exempt; flag for review.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — Aggregate-not-per-account trap.** The $10,000 FBAR threshold is
> tested on the **sum of peak balances across all accounts**. Multiple small accounts can
> trip it even when none individually exceeds $10,000. Never test accounts in isolation.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — Assets reportable on both forms.** Reporting a foreign account on
> the FBAR does **not** satisfy Form 8938, and vice versa. Map every asset to both regimes
> independently; the overlap is intentional, not redundant.

## Topic self-checks

- [ ] US-person status confirmed from the router output before applying either regime.
- [ ] All foreign accounts normalized to USD with documented FX rate and source.
- [ ] FBAR tested on **aggregate peak** balances, not per-account.
- [ ] Signature-authority-only accounts identified and included in the FBAR set.
- [ ] SFFA list built as a **superset** of FBAR accounts (added stock/securities held
      outside an account and foreign-entity interests).
- [ ] Form 8938 thresholds pulled from **current-year** instructions for the correct
      filing status and abroad/US residency — not the illustrative figures here.
- [ ] Both the last-day and any-time Form 8938 tests applied.
- [ ] Overlap noted: assets on both forms mapped independently; one does not satisfy the other.
- [ ] Deadlines set: FBAR Oct 15 (auto-extended); Form 8938 with the 1040 incl. extensions.
- [ ] Willfulness and remediation-path selection flagged as open items for counsel — not resolved.
- [ ] Conservative posture applied: where genuinely unsure, the item is flagged to file.
- [ ] Output is a working paper + reviewer brief; no claim of human sign-off.
