# US Expatriation & Exit Tax v0.1

## What this file is

This is a topic content skill that **loads on top of `cross-border-tax-workflow-base`**
and assumes the **`cross-border-tax-router`** has already run its Step 0 residency
map and routed the situation here. It carries the substantive US rules for two
populations who sever the US tax net:

1. a **US citizen who renounces** citizenship, and
2. a **long-term resident (LTR)** — a lawful permanent resident (green-card
   holder) for at least **8 of the prior 15 tax years** under **§877(e)(2)** — who
   **abandons** that status or is treated as a resident of a treaty country.

It produces a working paper and reviewer brief; it never produces a filed return,
and no human has signed off on its output until `request_accountant_review`
returns a credentialed sign-off.

**Sequencing — fix the exit-tax test and date FIRST.** Per the
`cross-border-tax-router` sequencing rule, the **covered-expatriate
determination and the expatriation date must be fixed before any
post-expatriation disposal is planned**. Expatriation triggers a **deemed sale of
all worldwide property** the day before the expatriation date (§877A(a)), which
**resets basis** and changes the timing of every later transaction. Planning a
disposal before pinning the date produces wrong basis and wrong gain. Do the test
and the date, then plan.

**Currency.** The **net-worth $2,000,000 test threshold is fixed by statute** and
not indexed. Two figures **are** inflation-indexed and change every year — the
**average-annual-net-income-tax threshold** and the **net-gain exclusion amount**
for the mark-to-market tax. This file never hardcodes a current figure as
authoritative; it instructs the agent to **confirm the current-year value** from
the Form 8854 instructions / the relevant Rev. Proc. inflation-adjustment release
before computing.

## Layer A — Reference layer (the rules)

### A.1 — Who is an "expatriate" (IRC §877A(g)(2), §877(e))

An **expatriate** is (a) a US citizen who **relinquishes citizenship**, or (b) an
LTR who **ceases to be a lawful permanent resident**. The expatriation regime of
§877A only bites where the expatriate is also a **covered expatriate**. Non-LTR
green-card holders and ordinary non-resident aliens are out of scope.

### A.2 — Covered-expatriate decision tree (IRC §877A(g)(1), §877(a)(2))

An expatriate is a **covered expatriate** if they meet **ANY ONE** of the three
independent tests below (subject to the limited exceptions in A.4):

1. **Net-worth test — §877(a)(2)(B).** Worldwide net worth is **≥ $2,000,000** on
   the expatriation date. This threshold is **fixed** (not indexed). Net worth is
   computed on a **fair-market-value** balance-sheet basis — see A.3 and the
   valuation FLASH POINT.
2. **Net-income-tax test — §877(a)(2)(A).** The **average annual net US income
   tax** for the **5 tax years ending before** the expatriation date **exceeds**
   an **inflation-indexed threshold**. **Confirm the current-year figure** from
   the Form 8854 instructions before applying it — it has been in roughly the
   **$190k–$200k** range in recent years, but treat any number here as
   *confirm current year*, not authoritative.
3. **Certification test — §877(a)(2)(C).** The expatriate **fails to certify, on
   Form 8854, under penalties of perjury, full compliance with all US federal tax
   obligations for the 5 tax years** preceding expatriation (and to attach
   evidence of compliance if requested). **Failure to certify makes the person a
   covered expatriate regardless of net worth or income** — see the certification
   FLASH POINT.

Meeting any one test ⇒ covered. The three are tested **independently**; a person
under the net-worth and income thresholds is **still covered** if they cannot
certify on Form 8854.

### A.3 — Mark-to-market "exit tax" mechanics (IRC §877A(a), (b))

A covered expatriate is **treated as having sold all property** they own (with
limited exceptions for the special-regime assets in A.5) at **fair market value on
the day before the expatriation date** (§877A(a)(1)). 

- **Net gain** from the deemed sale is recognized; **net gain above an
  inflation-indexed exclusion amount** is taxed (§877A(a)(3)). **Confirm the
  current-year exclusion** from the Form 8854 instructions / Rev. Proc. — it has
  been **above ~$800k** in recent years; treat as *confirm current year*.
- The exclusion amount is **allocated** pro rata across the assets with built-in
  gain.
- **Losses** are taken into account (and wash-sale rules under §1091 apply), but
  the **exclusion only shelters net gain**, not loss.
- An **irrevocable election to defer** the mark-to-market tax on a per-asset basis
  is available under **§877A(b)** — but it requires **adequate security** (e.g. a
  bond), a **waiver of treaty rights** to the assessment, and **interest accrues**
  until paid. Note it; do not assume it.

### A.4 — Exceptions to covered status (IRC §877A(g)(1)(B))

Two exceptions can keep an expatriate **out of covered status even if they breach
the net-worth or income test** — but **BOTH still require filing Form 8854 and
certifying 5 years of compliance** (the certification test is never waived):

1. **Dual-citizen-at-birth exception — §877A(g)(1)(B)(i).** The person (a) became
   **a US citizen and a citizen of another country at birth** and, as of the
   expatriation date, **continues to be a citizen of, and taxed as a resident of,
   that other country**, **AND** (b) was a **US resident for not more than 10 of
   the 15 tax years** ending with the expatriation year. See the dual-citizen
   FLASH POINT for the conditions.
2. **Minor-expatriate exception — §877A(g)(1)(B)(ii).** The person **relinquished
   US citizenship before age 18½** and was a **US resident for not more than 10
   tax years** before relinquishment.

If an exception applies, the person can **still certify** on Form 8854 and avoid
covered status; if they **cannot certify**, the certification test makes them
covered regardless of the exception.

### A.5 — Special asset regimes (IRC §877A(c)–(f))

Three asset classes are **carved out of the mark-to-market deemed sale** and given
their own treatment:

- **Eligible deferred compensation — §877A(d)(1).** If the payer is a US person
  (or a non-US payer that elects to be treated as one) and the covered expatriate
  **irrevocably waives treaty withholding-reduction rights**, the item is
  **"eligible"**: it is **not** marked to market; instead **30% withholding**
  applies to **future taxable payments**.
- **Ineligible deferred compensation — §877A(d)(2).** Where the eligibility
  conditions are **not** met, the covered expatriate is treated as receiving a
  **deemed lump-sum distribution** of the **present value** of the accrued benefit
  on the day before expatriation — taxed up front. See the deferred-comp FLASH
  POINT.
- **Specified tax-deferred accounts — §877A(e).** IRAs, §529 plans, Coverdell
  ESAs, health/medical savings accounts, etc. are treated as receiving a **deemed
  full distribution** of the entire account on the day before expatriation
  (income tax applies; the **10% early-distribution additional tax does not**).
  See the IRA FLASH POINT.
- **Interests in non-grantor trusts — §877A(f).** A covered expatriate's
  beneficial interest in a **non-grantor trust** is **not** marked to market.
  Instead, the trustee withholds **30% of the taxable portion of each direct or
  indirect distribution** to the covered expatriate. **Cross-reference
  `us-foreign-trust-reporting`** for the trust classification (grantor vs
  non-grantor) and the reporting that surrounds it. See the trust FLASH POINT.

### A.6 — §2801 transfer tax on US recipients (high level)

Separate from the exit tax, **IRC §2801** imposes a **transfer tax on the US
citizen or resident recipient** of a **"covered gift or bequest"** received from a
**covered expatriate** — at the highest gift/estate-tax rate, on amounts above the
annual exclusion. This is a **distinct transfer-tax regime** that follows the
covered expatriate **indefinitely** and burdens the **recipient**, not the
expatriate. Flag it at a high level when a covered-expatriate determination is
positive; do not compute it in this file.

---

## Layer B — Executable layer (the procedure)

Work the steps in order. Do **not** plan disposals before Step 4 is fixed.

**B.1 — Confirm status and dates.** Determine whether the person is a renouncing
**citizen** or an **LTR** (8-of-15-years test, §877(e)(2)). Fix the
**expatriation date** (date of the consular renunciation / CLN, or the date LPR
status was abandoned or treaty-residence began). Record it; everything keys off
the **day before** this date.

**B.2 — Build the FMV net-worth balance sheet.** Schedule **all worldwide assets
at fair market value** less liabilities: real property, business interests,
publicly traded and private securities, **pension and deferred-comp present
values**, **vested and unvested options/RSUs**, IRAs and other tax-deferred
accounts, and **beneficial interests in trusts**. Compare to the **$2,000,000**
fixed threshold.

**B.3 — Compute the 5-year average net income tax.** Pull the **net US income
tax** from the 5 returns ending before the expatriation year, average them, and
compare to the **current-year indexed threshold** (*confirm current year*).

**B.4 — Determine covered status.** Apply the A.2 tree: net-worth OR income OR
certification-failure ⇒ **covered**. Apply the A.4 exceptions (dual-citizen /
minor) only to the net-worth and income tests, **never** to certification. Record
which test(s) are met and why.

**B.5 — If covered, compute the exit tax.** Mark all non-special-regime property
to market (FMV day-before less basis), net the gains and losses, subtract the
**indexed net-gain exclusion** (*confirm current year*), and apply the relevant
capital-gain / ordinary rates. Apply the **§877A(b)** deferral election only if
security and a treaty waiver are in place. Separately run the **special regimes**
(A.5): ineligible deferred comp and tax-deferred accounts as **deemed
distributions**; eligible deferred comp and non-grantor-trust interests as **30%
future-payment withholding**.

**B.6 — Prepare Form 8854.** Complete **Form 8854 (Initial and Annual
Expatriation Statement)** to **establish the expatriation date** and **certify 5
years of compliance**. Remember: **non-filing or non-certification of Form 8854 is
itself the certification test failing**, which makes the person covered regardless
of B.2/B.3. Note any **annual** Form 8854 obligations (e.g. while a deferral
election is outstanding).

**B.7 — Flag §2801 exposure.** If covered, note in the reviewer brief that future
gifts/bequests from this person to US persons fall under the **§2801** recipient
transfer-tax regime.

**B.8 — Assemble working paper + reviewer brief** and route to
`request_accountant_review`. Mark every indexed figure as *confirm current year*.

## Topic self-checks

- [ ] Is the person a renouncing **citizen** or an **LTR** (8-of-15-years,
      §877(e)(2))? Expatriation date fixed and recorded?
- [ ] Was the **exit-tax test and date fixed BEFORE** any post-expatriation
      disposal was planned (router sequencing rule)?
- [ ] FMV net-worth balance sheet built, **including** pensions, options, IRAs and
      **trust interests**? Compared to the **fixed $2,000,000** threshold?
- [ ] 5-year average net income tax computed and compared to the
      **indexed threshold** — figure marked *confirm current year*?
- [ ] **Form 8854 certification** confirmed? (Non-certification = covered,

      exceptions applied **only** to net-worth/income, never to certification?
- [ ] Mark-to-market gain computed with the **indexed net-gain exclusion** marked
      *confirm current year*? Loss and §1091 wash-sale rules considered?
- [ ] Special regimes run separately — ineligible deferred comp and tax-deferred

      non-grantor-trust interests as **30% withholding** (§877A(d)–(f))?
- [ ] **§877A(b)** deferral election only assumed where security + treaty waiver
      exist?
- [ ] **§2801** recipient transfer-tax exposure flagged in the reviewer brief?
- [ ] `us-foreign-trust-reporting` cross-referenced for any trust interest?
