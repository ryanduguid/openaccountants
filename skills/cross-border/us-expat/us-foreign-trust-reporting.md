# US Foreign Trust Taxation & Reporting v0.1

## What this file is

This is a **topic content skill**. It loads on top of
`cross-border-tax-workflow-base` and assumes the **cross-border-tax-router has
already run** and sequenced the engagement. It carries the US foreign-trust
rules only; the workflow architecture, intake map, sequenced-plan contract, and
mandatory human hand-off live in the base.

**Characterize the trust FIRST.** Before any distribution is taxed, any gain on a
sale is computed, or any form is selected, this skill determines (1) whether the
trust is *foreign*, and (2) whether it is a *grantor* (owned) or *non-grantor*
trust as to the US person. Every downstream number depends on that answer. A
distribution from a grantor trust the US person already owns is not a taxable
distribution at all; the same cash from a non-grantor trust can carry throwback
tax plus an interest charge. Do not compute the consequence before you have
fixed the character.

**Currency.** Provisions cited are current US federal law (IRC + Forms 3520 /
3520-A). Penalty *amounts* below are the long-standing statutory figures; confirm
current indexing and any active penalty-relief procedure for the filing year.

This output is a **working paper**, never a filed return. Foreign-trust positions
carry some of the highest penalty exposure in the Code (§6677, §6048). The
foreign-country (e.g. Australian) treatment is **out of scope** and is deferred to
a local accountant — see the flash points.

## Layer A — Reference layer

### A1. Is the trust FOREIGN? (the two "courts" tests)

A trust is a **US (domestic) trust only if it passes BOTH** of the following.
Fail either one and it is a **foreign trust** (IRC §7701(a)(30)(E),
§7701(a)(31)(B)):

```
COURT TEST (§7701(a)(30)(E)(i))
  A court within the US is able to exercise primary supervision
  over the administration of the trust?
        NO  ──────────────────────────────► FOREIGN TRUST
        YES ▼
CONTROL TEST (§7701(a)(30)(E)(ii))
  One or more US persons have authority to control all
  substantial decisions of the trust?
        NO  ──────────────────────────────► FOREIGN TRUST
        YES ▼
                                  ───────────► DOMESTIC TRUST
```

- "All substantial decisions" is read strictly (distributions, who can benefit,
  investment, removal/replacement of trustee, termination, litigation). A single
  substantial decision controlled by a non-US person taints the control test.
- A foreign trustee, foreign situs, or foreign-law governing instrument typically
  fails the court test.
- **Conservative default:** if either test is not clearly met on the documents,
  treat the trust as **FOREIGN** and proceed under this skill.

### A2. GRANTOR vs NON-GRANTOR (is a US person the OWNER?) — §671–679

If a US person is treated as the **owner** of all or part of the trust under the
grantor-trust rules, that person is taxed **currently** on the trust's income
(income, deductions, credits flow through — §671), regardless of whether anything
is distributed. Run these in order:

```
§673–678 ordinary grantor-trust triggers
  Retained reversion, power to control beneficial enjoyment, certain
  administrative powers, revocability, retained income interest, or a
  power held by a person to vest corpus/income in himself?
        YES ─► US person is OWNER of that portion (GRANTOR TRUST)
        NO  ▼
§679  — the foreign-trust-specific owner rule  ◄── the decisive one offshore
  A US person (directly or indirectly) TRANSFERRED property to a
  FOREIGN trust that has (or may have) a US BENEFICIARY?
        YES ─► US transferor is treated as OWNER of the transferred
               portion → GRANTOR TRUST as to that US person
        NO  ▼
                          ───► NON-GRANTOR FOREIGN TRUST
                               (throwback regime applies to US-beneficiary
                                distributions — see A3)
```

§679 notes:
- The "US beneficiary" condition is read broadly: if **any** trust terms could
  permit a US person to benefit, or amounts could be accumulated for a future US
  beneficiary, the condition is generally treated as met.
- §679 can apply to transfers made *before* the transferor became a US person
  but within the look-back window tied to US residency (the 5-year pre-residency
  rule) — flag any transfer near an immigration date.
- A transfer for full fair-market-value consideration is generally outside §679;
  a gratuitous or below-value transfer is in.

### A3. NON-GRANTOR foreign trust → US-beneficiary DISTRIBUTIONS: throwback (§665–668)

A US person who is a beneficiary (not owner) of a foreign non-grantor trust is
taxed on distributions under the **throwback / accumulation-distribution regime**:

- **DNI first.** A current-year distribution carries out distributable net income
  (DNI) and is taxed to the beneficiary at ordinary rates (character preserved).
- **UNI / accumulation distribution (§665).** Income a foreign trust **earned in
  a prior year but did not distribute** becomes **undistributed net income
  (UNI)**. A distribution exceeding current DNI is an **accumulation
  distribution** that pulls UNI out of prior years ("throwback").
- **Throwback tax (§666–667).** The thrown-back UNI is taxed as if received in
  the earlier years (averaging mechanics), and — critically — **long-term capital
  gains accumulated in a foreign trust lose their preferential character** and
  come out as ordinary income.
- **§668 interest charge.** A non-deductible **interest charge** is imposed on the
  deferred tax, compounding for **every year the income sat undistributed**. For a
  trust that accumulated for decades, the interest charge alone can approach or
  exceed the distribution — this is why long-accumulating foreign trusts are
  punitive to US beneficiaries.

**Default method vs actual method:**
- **Actual (exact) method** — requires the trust's complete year-by-year DNI/UNI
  records to allocate UNI to specific accumulation years; usually the lower
  number, but needs reliable historical accounting.
- **Default method (Form 3520 instructions)** — used when the year-by-year history
  is unavailable. It synthesizes an average accumulation period and applies the
  highest rate, generally producing a **higher** tax and interest charge.
- **Conservative default:** if the trust cannot produce reliable year-by-year UNI
  records, assume the **default method** applies and flag the UNI exposure as
  material and probably understated by any back-of-envelope estimate.

### A4. Reporting forms

| Form | Who / when | Covers |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **Form 3520** (§6048(a)/(c)) | The US person | Transfers TO a foreign trust; distributions FROM a foreign trust; ownership of a foreign trust; AND large gifts/bequests from foreign persons/estates. |
| **Form 3520-A** (§6048(b)) | The foreign trust (the **US owner** is responsible for ensuring it is filed; owner files a substitute if the trust will not) | Annual information return of a foreign trust **with a US owner** — income statement, balance sheet, and Foreign Grantor Trust Owner/Beneficiary statements to the US persons. |

Penalties (§6677):
- **Form 3520:** greater of **$10,000 or 35%** of the gross value of the
  property transferred / distribution received (5% for failure to report
  ownership), per failure.
- **Form 3520-A:** greater of **$10,000 or 5% of the gross value of the trust's
  assets** treated as owned by the US person, **per month** of non-compliance.
- Large foreign gift/bequest under-reporting carries a separate 5%-per-month
  penalty (capped).
- **Reasonable cause** is a defense (§6677(d)); recent IRS practice has moved
  toward **first-time-abatement-style relief** and away from automatic systemic
  assessment on late-filed 3520/3520-A — confirm the current procedure and assert
  reasonable cause affirmatively where the facts support it.

## Layer B — Executable layer (trust facts → owner → treatment → forms)

Run top to bottom. Stop and flag at any unknown — do not assume favorably.

1. **Gather trust facts.** Instrument, governing law, situs, trustee
   nationality/residence, who controls each substantial decision, settlor,
   beneficiary class, funding history (who transferred what, when, for what
   consideration), and year-by-year income/distribution records if any.
2. **FOREIGN test (A1).** Apply court + control. If either fails → foreign.
   If either is unclear → treat as foreign.
3. **OWNER test (A2).** Apply §673–678, then **§679**. Decide grantor vs
   non-grantor **as to each relevant US person**. A trust can be a grantor trust
   as to one US person and not another.
4. **Branch:**
   - **Grantor (US owner):** trust income is reported on the **owner's** US
     return currently (Schedule B / relevant schedules). File **Form 3520-A**
     (or substitute) and **Form 3520**. Distributions to the owner are generally
     **non-taxable returns of owned assets** — characterize the trust before
     calling any cash a "distribution."
   - **Non-grantor + US-beneficiary distribution:** compute DNI; identify any
     accumulation distribution; run throwback (A3) under actual method if records
     allow, else default method; add the **§668 interest charge**. Report on
     **Form 3520**.
   - **No US owner, no distribution this year:** report transfers/ownership as
     applicable on **Form 3520**; UNI continues to accrue silently — note future
     exposure.
5. **SALE overlay (see flash point).** Determine the **tax owner at the moment of
   sale** from step 3, *before* computing gain. Grantor analysis first: if a US
   person owns the trust under §679, gain on the trust selling an asset is **that
   US person's gain currently**. If non-grantor, gain stays in the trust, swells
   DNI/UNI, and is taxed to a US beneficiary only on distribution (with throwback
   on any accumulated portion).
6. **Residency overlay.** If the US person's status is changing (expatriation,
   becoming/ceasing to be a US person), the **router's sequencing rule** governs
   order of operations and you must **cross-reference
   `us-expatriation-exit-tax`** — a §877A mark-to-market and the §679 ownership
   question can collide.
7. **Assemble working paper + reviewer brief** per the base contract.

## Audit flash points

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — §679 deemed ownership.** A US person who transferred
> property to a foreign trust that *could* benefit any US person is treated as the
> **owner** even with no distribution and no retained control. Check funding
> history and any transfer within the pre-residency window. Missing this turns a
> "non-grantor" analysis into a current-tax-and-3520-A filing obligation.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — throwback interest on long-accumulated UNI.** For a
> foreign non-grantor trust that accumulated income for many years, the **§668
> interest charge** compounds across every accumulation year and capital gains
> lose their character. The interest can rival the distribution itself. If
> year-by-year records are missing, assume the **default method** and treat the
> exposure as large and under-estimated.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — 3520 / 3520-A penalties and reasonable cause.**
> Penalties run to **35%** (3520) and **5%/month** (3520-A) of trust value.
> File on time; if late, assert **reasonable cause (§6677(d))** affirmatively and
> check the current IRS penalty-relief / first-time-abatement posture before
> assuming an automatic penalty.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — US vs foreign characterization mismatch.** A trust the
> US treats as a foreign **non-grantor** trust may be treated entirely
> differently abroad. **Australian discretionary and unit trusts** are common and
> are **typically foreign non-grantor trusts to the US unless §679 applies** —
> but their Australian treatment (e.g. trust distributions, CGT, present
> entitlement) does **not** track the US analysis. The two systems can each tax
> the same economics differently and double-tax relief is not automatic. The
> Australian side **requires a local accountant** — do not opine on it.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — selling trust assets vs distributing then selling:
> order matters.** Whether the trust sells the asset (gain lands in the trust → DNI/
> UNI → throwback to a US beneficiary later) or distributes the asset first and the
> US person sells (gain on the beneficiary's own return, possibly with stepped
> basis questions) produces **materially different US tax**. Fix the **tax owner at
> the instant of sale** under the §679/grantor analysis **before** modelling the
> sale, and sequence per the router.

## Disclaimer

Provides computational and interpretive guidance on US foreign-trust taxation and
Forms 3520/3520-A only. Not tax or legal advice and not a filed return. Trust
characterization and throwback turn on the trust instrument and history and
require professional judgement; the foreign-country treatment requires a local
accountant. Have outputs reviewed and signed by a qualified, licensed accountant
before acting. Research-verified (tier 2) pending credentialed sign-off.
