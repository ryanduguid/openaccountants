# US Foreign Earned Income Exclusion vs Foreign Tax Credit v0.1

## What this file is

This is a topic content skill that **loads on top of `cross-border-tax-workflow-base`**
and assumes the **`cross-border-tax-router`** has already run its Step 0 residency
map and routed the situation here. It carries the substantive US rules for a US
citizen or lawful permanent resident (green-card holder) earning wages or
self-employment income abroad: when to elect the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion
under **IRC §911** (claimed on **Form 2555**), when to instead take the Foreign
Tax Credit under **IRC §901 / §904** (claimed on **Form 1116**), and how the two
interact. It produces a working paper and reviewer brief; it never produces a
filed return, and no human has signed off on its output until
`request_accountant_review` returns a credentialed sign-off.

**Currency.** The FEIE cap, the housing base/ceiling amounts, and bracket
thresholds are **inflation-indexed and change every year**. This file never
hardcodes a current figure as authoritative — it instructs the agent to confirm
the current tax-year number from the relevant IRS source (Form 2555 instructions,
Rev. Proc. inflation-adjustment release) before computing.

## Layer A — Reference layer (the rules)

### A.1 — Who is in scope (IRC §911(d)(1), §7701(b)(6))

US citizens and green-card holders are taxed on **worldwide income** regardless of
where they live. §911 and the FTC are the two relief mechanisms against the
resulting double tax. Non-resident aliens are out of scope for this file.

### A.2 — The §911 qualification gate (decision tree)

To exclude foreign **earned** income under §911 the person must satisfy **both**:

1. **Tax home in a foreign country** — §911(d)(1), (d)(3). The tax home is the
   person's regular/principal place of business; if their **abode** remains in the
   US, they fail this test even if they work abroad. **AND**
2. **One of the two presence tests:**
   - **Bona-fide-residence test — §911(d)(1)(A).** The person is a bona-fide
     resident of a foreign country for an **uninterrupted period that includes a
     full tax year**. This is a facts-and-circumstances test (intent, ties,
     duration, family location, local tax status) — see flash point below.
     Available to **US citizens** and to green-card holders **only** if a treaty
     non-discrimination article supports it.
   - **Physical-presence test — §911(d)(1)(B).** The person is physically present
     in a foreign country/countries for **≥ 330 full days** in any **12
     consecutive months**. Mechanical day-count; the 12-month window can straddle
     two tax years and the exclusion is prorated.

```
Foreign earned income?
 └─ Tax home abroad (abode not in US)?  ──no──▶ §911 unavailable → use FTC (Form 1116)
        └─ yes
            ├─ Bona-fide resident a full tax year?  ──yes──▶ §911 available
            └─ ≥330 full days in 12 consecutive months? ──yes──▶ §911 available (prorated)
                  └─ neither ──▶ §911 unavailable → use FTC (Form 1116)
```

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT —** The **bona-fide-residence test (§911(d)(1)(A))** is a
> facts-and-circumstances judgement the IRS actively challenges. Claiming a foreign
> tax home as a non-resident of the host country, retaining a US abode, short
> assignments, or filing a host-country return as a *non-resident* all undercut it.
> Document: host-country residence permit/visa, local tax-residency status, lease/
> property, family location, and intent of an indefinite (not temporary) stay. Where
> bona-fide residence is shaky, fall back to the mechanical 330-day physical-presence
> test or to the FTC, which needs no presence test.

### A.3 — What §911 excludes, and the cap

- **Foreign earned income** = compensation for **services performed abroad**
  (wages, self-employment income). It does **not** include passive income
  (dividends, interest, capital gains, rents), pension/annuity income, or amounts
  paid by the US government. §911(b)(1), (d)(2).
- **The exclusion cap is annual, inflation-indexed, and per-qualifying-person.**
  *Confirm the current tax-year figure* — illustratively it has been in the
  **~US$120k–130k** range in recent years; **do not** rely on that bracket as
  current, confirm it. §911(b)(2)(D).
- **Prorated** by qualifying days if the qualifying period covers only part of the
  tax year (physical-presence straddles especially). §911(b)(2)(A).

### A.4 — Foreign housing exclusion / deduction (§911(c))

- Qualifying housing expenses **above a base amount** may be excluded (employees)
  or deducted (self-employed). §911(c)(1)–(4).
- The **base amount** (a percentage of the FEIE cap) and the **ceiling** on
  qualifying expenses are both inflation-indexed and the ceiling is **adjusted for
  high-cost locations** in the Form 2555 instructions. *Confirm both current-year
  amounts; do not hardcode.*

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT —** The housing **base amount** floor and the **location-
> specific ceiling** are routinely miscomputed. Expenses below the base produce no
> benefit; expenses above the (location-adjusted) ceiling are capped. Pull the
> current-year base and the high-cost-area table from the Form 2555 instructions and
> show the arithmetic; never assume the standard ceiling for a listed high-cost city.

### A.5 — The election and its revocation lock-out (§911(e), Reg. §1.911-7)

- §911 applies **only if elected**, on **Form 2555** filed with the return.
- An election **stays in effect** for future years until revoked.
- A taxpayer may **revoke** the election; but once revoked, they **cannot re-elect
  §911 for 5 tax years** without IRS consent (a ruling). §911(e)(2),
  Reg. §1.911-7(b).

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT —** The **5-year §911 revocation lock-out** is an
> irreversible trap. Switching from FEIE to FTC in a single year by *revoking* the
> election (rather than simply not benefiting from it) bars re-election for 5 years
> absent a private letter ruling. If the person may want FEIE back soon, do **not**
> revoke — model the FTC path *without* a §911 revocation, and flag the choice for
> the reviewer to own.

### A.6 — The stacking rule (§911(f))

Excluded income is **not** taxed, but it **still pushes the remaining
(non-excluded) income into higher brackets**: tax on the non-excluded income is
computed as if the excluded amount were the bottom layer of the bracket stack.
§911(f). Practically, §911 removes income from the *base* but not from the
*rate-setting stack* — use the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet in the Form 1040
instructions.

### A.7 — Foreign Tax Credit mechanics (§901, §904; Form 1116)

- **§901** grants a credit for **foreign income taxes paid or accrued**.
- **§904 limitation:** the credit cannot exceed US tax on foreign-source income,
  computed **separately per income category ("basket")** — chiefly the **general**
  basket (active/earned) and the **passive** basket. Excess credit in one basket
  cannot offset US tax on income in another.
- **Carry rules (§904(c)):** excess FTC **carries back 1 year and forward 10
  years**, within the same basket.
- **§911 coordination (§911(d)(6)):** **no FTC is allowed on income excluded under
  §911.** Foreign tax allocable to excluded income is disallowed; only the foreign
  tax on the **non-excluded** portion is creditable. You cannot exclude income *and*
  credit the foreign tax on it.

### A.8 — The FEIE-vs-FTC decision (decision tree)

```
Foreign country effective tax rate on the earned income?
 ├─ High-tax country (foreign rate ≥ US rate on that income)
 │     └─ FTC (Form 1116) generally better:
 │          • foreign tax usually fully offsets US tax, often with carryforward
 │          • income stays "earned" for refundable Additional Child Tax Credit & IRA room
 │          • no §911 election to revoke later
 └─ Low / no-tax country (foreign rate ≈ 0, or < US rate)
       └─ FEIE (Form 2555) generally better:
            • little/no foreign tax to credit, so FTC gives little relief
            • §911 removes the income from the US base (subject to the cap & stacking)
            • watch: FEIE can ZERO OUT earned income → kills refundable ACTC and IRA room
```

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT —** Electing **FEIE can destroy the refundable Additional
> Child Tax Credit and IRA-contribution room.** Excluding the earned income removes
> the **compensation** that supports an IRA contribution (§219) and removes the
> **earned income** that drives the refundable portion of the Child Tax Credit
> (§24). In a low-tax country a family may net *more cash* using the **FTC** (or
> excluding only up to the cap and leaving enough earned income) than using full
> FEIE. Model both before recommending.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT —** **You cannot double-dip (§911(d)(6)).** Claiming FEIE
> on Form 2555 *and* an FTC on Form 1116 for the foreign tax on the *same* excluded
> income is disallowed. If the person exceeds the FEIE cap, only the foreign tax on
> the **excess (non-excluded)** income is creditable — allocate the foreign tax
> pro-rata and show the disallowed portion.

## Layer B — Executable layer (the procedure)

Given a person's facts — **foreign salary / SE income, days abroad (and the
12-month window), foreign income tax paid, host country, filing status, children,
IRA intent** — produce the recommended election, the numbers, and the forms.

**Step 1 — Confirm scope.** Verify US citizen or green-card holder with foreign
*earned* income. Separate earned income (in scope) from passive income (FTC only,
passive basket — A.7).

**Step 2 — Run the §911 gate (A.2).** Establish tax home abroad (abode not US).
Then test bona-fide residence (full tax year) **or** physical presence (≥330 full
days in 12 consecutive months). Record which test, the dates, and the day count.
If neither passes → §911 is unavailable; go straight to FTC (Step 6).

**Step 3 — Pull current-year indexed figures.** Confirm, for the tax year in
question: the **FEIE cap**, the **housing base amount**, and the **housing
ceiling** (with high-cost-area adjustment for the host city) from the Form 2555
instructions. *Do not reuse a prior-year number.*

**Step 4 — Compute the FEIE path (if available).**
- Excludible earned income = min(foreign earned income, FEIE cap), **prorated** by
  qualifying days if the period is partial (A.3).
- Add the **housing exclusion** = qualifying housing expenses − base amount, capped
  at the (location-adjusted) ceiling (A.4).
- Apply the **stacking rule (A.6)** — compute residual US tax on non-excluded
  income via the Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet (tax at the rates that apply
  *as if* the excluded income were stacked underneath).
- Note the **side effects:** does FEIE zero out earned income, killing refundable
  ACTC / IRA room?

**Step 5 — Compute the FTC path.**
- Foreign tax paid/accrued on the **general-basket** earned income (and a separate
  Form 1116 for any **passive-basket** income).
- §904 limitation per basket = US tax × (foreign-source taxable income in basket ÷
  total taxable income).
- Allowed credit = min(foreign tax in basket, §904 limit). Excess → carryback 1 /
  carryforward 10 (A.7).
- Earned income **stays in the base**, preserving ACTC refundability and IRA room.

**Step 6 — Compare and recommend.**
- Compute total US tax (and net family cash, including refundable credits) under:
  (a) full FEIE + housing, (b) full FTC, and, where relevant, (c) FEIE up to the
  cap with FTC on the excess. Recommend the lowest-tax / highest-net-cash option
  that is **conservative** and defensible.
- If recommending a **switch away from a prior §911 election**, check whether it
  requires a **revocation** (5-year lock-out, A.5) and flag it.

**Step 7 — Map the forms & build outputs.** Form **2555** (FEIE/housing), Form
**1116** (FTC, one per basket), the **Foreign Earned Income Tax Worksheet**, and
Schedule **3** (credits). Add any information returns the base §7 checklist flags
(FBAR/FinCEN 114, Form 8938, 3520, 5471/8865, 8621) — those are not optional just
because the income question is answered. Then assemble the base-§7 outputs
(situation map, sequenced plan, reference trace, bridge summary, reviewer brief,
hand-off).
