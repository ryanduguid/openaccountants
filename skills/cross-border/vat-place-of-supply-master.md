## Section 1: General Rules for Services

**Legislation:** VAT Directive 2006/112/EC, Articles 44 and 45.

There are two basic rules. Every service starts here before checking exceptions.

### Article 44 — B2B General Rule [T1]

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Customer | Taxable person acting as such (business with VAT number) |
| Place of supply | Where the **customer** is established (or has a fixed establishment receiving the service) |
| VAT consequence | Supplier invoices without VAT; customer self-assesses under reverse charge (Art 196 within EU) |
| Verify | Customer's VAT number via VIES before zero-rating |

### Article 45 — B2C General Rule [T1]

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Customer | Non-taxable person (private individual) |
| Place of supply | Where the **supplier** is established (or has a fixed establishment from which the service is supplied) |
| VAT consequence | Supplier charges their own country's VAT rate |
| Exception | Numerous special rules override Art 45 for specific service types (see Section 2) |

### Quick Reference

| Scenario | Place of Supply | Who Accounts for VAT |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| B2B general service | Customer's country | Customer (reverse charge) |
| B2C general service | Supplier's country | Supplier |

---

## Section 2: Special Rules for Services

These override the general rules above. Always check whether an exception applies before defaulting to Art 44/45.

### 2.1 Immovable Property — Article 47 [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Applies to | Valuation, estate agency, legal services related to property, construction, accommodation, property management, architect services |
| Place of supply | Where the **property is located** — regardless of B2B/B2C and regardless of where supplier or customer is |
| Practical impact | A German architect designing a building in Portugal must charge Portuguese VAT (or register there), even if the client is in Ireland |
| Common trap | Freelancers forget that remote design work for foreign property still follows this rule |

### 2.2 Passenger Transport — Article 48 [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the transport takes place, **proportional to distances covered** in each country |
| B2B/B2C | Same rule applies to both |
| Example | A bus journey from Belgium through Luxembourg to Germany: VAT is split proportionally across all three countries |

### 2.3 Goods Transport (B2C only) — Article 49 [T2]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the transport takes place, proportional to distances |
| B2B | Art 44 applies instead (customer's country) |
| B2C intra-EU | Place where transport begins, unless transport is between two member states — then destination |

### 2.4 Cultural, Artistic, Sporting, Scientific, Educational, Entertainment Events — Articles 53–54 [T2]

| Scenario | Article | Place of Supply |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| B2B — admission to an event | Art 53 | Where the event **physically takes place** |
| B2C — admission and related services | Art 54 | Where the event physically takes place |
| B2B — services other than admission (e.g., organising, production) | Art 44 | Customer's country (general rule) |

**Key distinction:** "Admission" means the right to attend. Organising or sponsoring an event for a business client follows the general B2B rule (Art 44), not the event location rule.

ECJ case C-647/17 (*Srf konsulterna*): A seminar involving active participation for a business client is a B2B service under Art 44, not "admission" under Art 53.

### 2.5 Restaurant and Catering Services — Article 55 [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the services are **physically carried out** |
| On board transport | See Art 57 — place of supply = point of departure within EU |
| B2B/B2C | Same rule for both |

### 2.6 Short-Term Hire of Transport — Article 56 [T1]

| Hire Duration | Place of Supply |
|--------------|----------------|
| Short-term (≤30 days; ≤90 days for vessels) | Where the means of transport is **put at the customer's disposal** |
| Long-term B2B | Customer's country (Art 44) |
| Long-term B2C | Supplier's country (Art 45), except pleasure boats = where put at disposal if supplier established there |

### 2.7 Electronically Supplied Services, Telecoms, Broadcasting (B2C) — Article 58 [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Applies to | SaaS, downloads, streaming, e-books, online courses (pre-recorded), cloud hosting, telecoms, broadcasting — B2C only |
| Place of supply | Where the **customer** is established / resides |
| B2B | Art 44 applies instead (customer's country, reverse charge) |
| EUR 10,000 threshold (Art 59c) | EU-established sellers below €10,000 total cross-border B2C digital sales may charge home-country VAT |
| Non-EU sellers | No threshold benefit; must always charge destination-country rate |
| Compliance | Use OSS (One-Stop Shop) to report across all EU countries from a single registration |

### 2.8 "Listed Services" to Non-EU Consumers (B2C) — Article 59 [T1]

Certain services supplied B2C to a person **outside the EU** are taxed where the customer is — making them outside the scope of EU VAT:

- Intellectual property / copyright licensing
- Advertising
- Consulting, legal, accounting, engineering
- Data processing, information supply
- Banking, financial, insurance services
- Staff supply
- Hiring of movable tangible property (except transport)
- Telecoms, broadcasting, electronically supplied services

**If the B2C service is NOT on this list** (e.g., personal services, cleaning, yoga instruction): place of supply remains the supplier's country under Art 45, even if the consumer is outside the EU.

---

## Section 3: Rules for Goods

### 3.1 Domestic Supply — No Transport (Article 31) [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the goods are **located at the time of supply** |
| Example | Goods sold in a German shop to a walk-in customer: German VAT |

### 3.2 Goods Dispatched or Transported (Article 32) [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the goods are located when **dispatch or transport to the customer begins** |
| Example | German warehouse ships goods to a German customer: place of supply = Germany |
| Exception | Distance selling rules (Art 33) and installation/assembly (Art 36) override this |

### 3.3 Intra-EU Distance Selling (Article 33) [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| What | Goods sold to consumers (B2C) or non-VAT-registered entities in another EU country |
| Place of supply | Where dispatch or transport **ends** (customer's country) |
| EUR 10,000 threshold (Art 59c) | EU sellers below €10,000 total cross-border B2C goods + digital services may treat place of supply as origin country |
| Above threshold | Must charge destination-country VAT rate |
| Compliance | Use Union OSS to report all intra-EU distance sales from one registration |
| Post-2021 change | Individual country thresholds (€35,000/€100,000) replaced by single €10,000 EU-wide threshold |

### 3.4 Imports from Outside the EU (Article 30/60-61) [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of importation | The EU member state where goods **enter the EU** (Art 60) |
| Suspensive arrangements | If goods are placed under customs warehousing or transit, importation occurs where goods **leave** that arrangement (Art 61) |
| VAT due | At importation, by the importer — collected by customs |
| IOSS alternative | For goods ≤€150 sold B2C, use Import One-Stop Shop to collect VAT at point of sale |

### 3.5 Installation or Assembly (Article 36) [T1]

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| Place of supply | Where the goods are **installed or assembled** |
| Example | German manufacturer ships and installs machinery in a French factory: place of supply = France |

### 3.6 Chain Transactions (Article 36a) [T1]

Introduced by Directive (EU) 2018/1910 to simplify chain (successive) supplies:

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Scenario | Goods supplied A → B → C, shipped directly from A to C across EU borders |
| Transport attributed to | The supply **to** the intermediary operator (B) |
| Intermediary operator | A supplier in the chain (other than the first) who dispatches or arranges transport |
| Exception | If B communicates to A the VAT number issued by the dispatch member state, transport is attributed to B's supply to C |
| Effect | Only one supply in the chain is the intra-EU zero-rated supply; the other is a domestic supply |

**Simplified triangulation (Art 141):** In a three-party chain A (MS1) → B (MS2) → C (MS3), B can avoid registering in MS3 if all conditions of Art 141 are met. B issues an invoice with "reverse charge" and C self-assesses VAT in MS3.

## Section 4: OSS / IOSS Decision Tree

### When to register for One-Stop Shop

```
START: Do you sell goods or digital services B2C to consumers in other EU countries?
│
├─ NO → OSS not needed
│
├─ YES → Are you an EU-established business?
│   │
│   ├─ YES → Do your total cross-border B2C sales (goods + digital services)
│   │         exceed EUR 10,000/year?
│   │   │
│   │   ├─ NO → You MAY charge home-country VAT. OSS optional.
│   │   │        (But you can opt in to OSS voluntarily.)
│   │   │
│   │   └─ YES → You MUST charge destination-country VAT.
│   │             Register for UNION OSS in your home country.
│   │
│   └─ YES (established in >1 EU country) → EUR 10,000 threshold does NOT apply.
│         Register for Union OSS.
│
└─ YES → Are you a NON-EU business?
    │
    ├─ Selling digital services / telecoms / broadcasting B2C →
    │   Register for NON-UNION OSS in any EU country of choice.
    │   No threshold benefit. Always charge destination rate.
    │
    └─ Selling goods from outside EU, consignments ≤EUR 150 →
        Register for IOSS (Import One-Stop Shop).
        Collect VAT at checkout. Goods enter EU VAT-paid.
        Note: From 1 July 2026, EUR 3 flat customs duty also applies.
```

### OSS Comparison Table

| Scheme | Who | What | Filing |
|--------|-----|------|--------|
| Union OSS | EU-established sellers | Intra-EU B2C distance sales of goods + B2C services in other EU states | Quarterly, home country |
| Non-Union OSS | Non-EU sellers | B2C digital/telecom/broadcasting services to EU consumers | Quarterly, any EU country |
| IOSS | Any seller (EU or non-EU) | Distance sales of imported goods ≤€150 to EU consumers | Monthly, home/chosen country |

## Section 5: Non-EU Rules Comparison

### 5.1 US Sales Tax Nexus

| Aspect | US Rule |
|--------|---------|
| Tax type | Sales tax (state-level, not federal) |
| Place of supply equivalent | "Nexus" determines which state can tax you |
| Physical nexus | Office, warehouse, employee, or inventory in the state |
| Economic nexus (*South Dakota v. Wayfair*, 2018) | Most states: $100,000 in sales OR 200 transactions/year |
| Digital services | Taxability varies by state — SaaS taxable in ~25 states, not taxable in CA, GA, MO |
| No equivalent of reverse charge | Seller must collect and remit; no mechanism for buyer self-assessment in most states |
| Key difference from EU | No single national registration; must track nexus in 45+ states individually (or use automation like Stripe Tax, TaxJar, Avalara) |

### 5.2 Australian GST on Imports

| Aspect | Australian Rule |
|--------|----------------|
| Threshold | AUD 75,000/year in supplies to Australian consumers |
| Digital services B2C | Non-resident must register for GST and charge 10% |
| Low-value goods (≤AUD 1,000) | GST applies at point of sale since July 2018 |
| B2B | Reverse charge applies (Australian business self-assesses) |

### 5.3 India OIDAR (Online Information and Database Access or Retrieval)

| Aspect | Indian Rule |
|--------|-------------|
| Applies to | Non-resident suppliers of OIDAR services to non-taxable Indian recipients (B2C) |
| Definition | Services delivered over the internet — substantially automated, minimal human intervention |
| Rate | 18% IGST |
| Registration | Simplified registration under GST for non-resident OIDAR suppliers |
| B2B | Indian business self-assesses under reverse charge |
| Equalization Levy | Separate 2% levy on non-resident e-commerce operators (no global revenue threshold) |

### 5.4 Japan Consumption Tax on Digital Services

| Aspect | Japanese Rule |
|--------|--------------|
| Rate | 10% (8% reduced rate for food/beverages, not applicable to digital) |
| Non-resident digital services B2C | Must register and charge JCT regardless of revenue |
| B2B | Reverse charge applies for "specified services" received from abroad |
| Threshold | No de minimis for non-resident digital service providers to consumers |
| Invoice system | Qualified Invoice System (QIS) since October 2023 — registered invoices required for input tax credit |

### Comparison Summary

| Feature | EU | US | Australia | India | Japan |
|---------|----|----|-----------|-------|-------|
| Tax type | VAT | Sales tax | GST | GST + EL | JCT |
| B2B mechanism | Reverse charge | N/A | Reverse charge | Reverse charge | Reverse charge |
| B2C digital | Customer location | Nexus-based | Customer location | Customer location | Customer location |
| Single registration | OSS | No (per-state) | Single ATO reg | Single GST reg | Single NTA reg |
| Threshold (B2C digital) | €10,000 (EU sellers) | $100K/200 txn per state | AUD 75,000 | Nil (simplified reg) | Nil |

## Section 6: Practical Decision Flowchart for Freelancers

**"I'm in Country A, my client is in Country B, and I'm providing [service type]. What VAT applies?"**

### Step 1: Classify the Supply

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Are you selling **goods** (physical products)? | Go to Goods Flow (below) | Continue to Step 2 |

### Step 2: Identify the Customer

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Is your client a **business** (with a VAT number)? | B2B → Go to Step 3 | B2C → Go to Step 4 |

### Step 3: B2B Service — Check Exceptions

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Is the service related to **immovable property** (Art 47)? | VAT where property is located | Continue |
| Is the service **admission to an event** (Art 53)? | VAT where event takes place | Continue |
| Is it **short-term hire of transport** ≤30 days (Art 56)? | VAT where vehicle put at disposal | Continue |
| Is it **restaurant/catering** (Art 55)? | VAT where performed | Continue |
| Is it **passenger transport** (Art 48)? | VAT proportional to route | Continue |
| **None of the above?** | → **Art 44 applies.** Place of supply = client's country. Invoice without VAT. Client self-assesses (reverse charge in EU; self-assessment rules outside EU). | |

### Step 4: B2C Service — Check Exceptions

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Is it an **electronically supplied service, telecoms, or broadcasting** (Art 58)? | VAT where consumer is located. Use OSS if selling into EU. | Continue |
| Is the service related to **immovable property** (Art 47)? | VAT where property is located | Continue |
| Is it **admission to an event** (Art 54)? | VAT where event takes place | Continue |
| Is the consumer **outside the EU** and is the service on the Art 59 list? | Outside scope of EU VAT | Continue |
| **None of the above?** | → **Art 45 applies.** Place of supply = YOUR country. Charge your domestic VAT rate. | |

### Goods Flow

| Question | If YES | If NO |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Are you shipping goods to a **consumer in another EU country**? | Distance selling (Art 33). Above €10,000 threshold → destination VAT. Use Union OSS. | Continue |
| Are you shipping goods from **outside the EU** to EU consumers, value ≤€150? | Use IOSS. Collect destination VAT at checkout. | Continue |
| Are goods **installed/assembled** at customer location (Art 36)? | VAT where installed | Continue |
| Standard domestic or B2B intra-EU supply? | Art 31/32 (origin) or intra-EU zero-rated supply + acquisition tax in destination | |

### Common Freelancer Scenarios

| You are in... | Client is in... | Service | Result |
|--------------|----------------|---------|--------|
| Germany | France | Web development (B2B) | Art 44. No German VAT. French client reverse-charges at 20%. |
| Germany | France | Web development (B2C) | Art 45. Charge German 19% VAT. (Not a digital service — bespoke human work.) |
| Germany | France | SaaS subscription (B2C) | Art 58. Charge French 20% VAT. Report via OSS. |
| Malta | US | Consulting (B2B) | Art 44. Place of supply = US. No Malta VAT. Outside scope. |
| Malta | US | Pre-recorded online course (B2C) | Art 58/59. Place of supply = US (outside EU). No Malta VAT. But check US sales tax nexus. |
| UK | Germany | Design services (B2B) | UK is outside EU. No UK VAT (outside scope). German client self-assesses under German domestic rules. |
| India | Australia | Software dev (B2B) | Zero-rated export under IGST. No IGST if LUT filed. Australian client reverse-charges GST. |
| US | EU consumers | SaaS product (B2C) | Must register for non-Union OSS. Charge each EU country's VAT rate. No threshold benefit. |
| France | Switzerland | Architecture for property in France | Art 47. Property in France → French VAT at 20%, regardless of client location. |

---

## PROHIBITIONS

1. **NEVER** default to Art 44 or Art 45 without checking the exceptions in Section 2.
2. **NEVER** assume that all B2C services to foreign consumers are outside the scope of VAT. Only Art 59 "listed services" shift to the consumer's country for B2C.
3. **NEVER** ignore the immovable property rule (Art 47). It overrides everything.
4. **NEVER** apply the €10,000 threshold to non-EU sellers — they must always charge destination-country VAT.
5. **NEVER** confuse "zero-rated" with "exempt." Zero-rated preserves input VAT recovery; exempt does not.
6. **NEVER** skip VIES verification before zero-rating an intra-EU B2B supply.
7. **NEVER** assume the same place-of-supply rules apply in all countries. Non-EU jurisdictions (US, Australia, India, Japan) have fundamentally different approaches.

---

## Edge Cases

### EC1 — Bespoke software vs. SaaS (ESS classification) [T2]
**Situation:** A developer builds custom software for a specific B2C client. Is this an electronically supplied service (Art 58)?
**Resolution:** Custom software development with significant human intervention is NOT an ESS. It is a standard service under Art 45 (B2C) or Art 44 (B2B). Pre-packaged SaaS delivered automatically IS an ESS. Flag for reviewer if the degree of customisation is unclear.

### EC2 — Remote worker creating PE risk [T2]
**Situation:** A UK freelancer works from Spain for 8 months serving UK clients. Does Spain become the "establishment" for place-of-supply purposes?
**Resolution:** If the freelancer becomes established in Spain (fixed establishment under Art 11 of Implementing Regulation 282/2011), the place of supply of their B2C services may shift to Spain. B2B services under Art 44 are unaffected (place of supply = client's country). Flag for reviewer — tax residency and PE risk should also be assessed.

### EC3 — Mixed digital and live service bundle [T2]
**Situation:** A course provider sells a package: pre-recorded videos (ESS) + live weekly coaching calls (not ESS) to an EU consumer.
**Resolution:** If a single composite supply, the principal element determines classification. If independent supplies, each follows its own rules. Pre-recorded = Art 58 (customer location). Live coaching = Art 45 (supplier location). Flag for reviewer to determine whether composite or independent.

### EC4 — Chain transaction with unknown intermediary role [T3]
**Situation:** A → B → C chain where goods ship directly from Poland to Portugal, but it is unclear whether B is the intermediary operator under Art 36a.
**Resolution:** Escalate. The attribution of transport determines which supply is zero-rated (intra-EU) and which is domestic. Incorrect attribution can cause double taxation or VAT loss. Requires review of contractual arrangements and Incoterms.

### Test 3 — B2C SaaS, US company to French consumer
**Input:** US SaaS company sells a EUR 20/month subscription to a French consumer.
**Expected:** Art 58. ESS B2C. Place of supply = France. Non-Union OSS required. Charge 20% French VAT.

### Test 5 — Distance selling, below threshold
**Input:** Spanish e-commerce seller ships EUR 8,000 of handmade goods to consumers across 5 EU countries. Prior year was EUR 7,000.
**Expected:** Below €10,000 threshold. May treat place of supply as Spain and charge Spanish VAT. OSS optional.
