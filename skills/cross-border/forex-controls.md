## Why Forex Controls Matter

Forex (外汇) controls determine whether a person or business can freely move money in and out of a country. For founders earning from global customers, forex restrictions are often the single most important factor in choosing where to incorporate.

**Key principle:** If your home country has strict forex controls, incorporate in a country WITHOUT controls (HK, SG, US, UAE). This enables unrestricted global payment receipt and selective remittance of only living expenses to the home country.

| Nationality | Forex Impact | Annual Limit | Recommended Structure |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------------|
| Chinese (大陆) | **CRITICAL** | $50,000/year individual | HK Ltd → HK bank → Stripe HK |
| Indian | **HIGH** | $250,000/year (LRS) + 20% TCS >₹10 lakh | US LLC or SG Pte. Ltd. via LRS |
| Brazilian | **HIGH** | Complex bank requirements + IOF tax | US LLC + Mercury |
| Taiwanese | **MODERATE** | Declaration required >TWD 5,000,000 (~$150K USD) | HK Ltd or SG Pte. Ltd. |
| Korean | **MODERATE** | Report >$50,000 transactions | US LLC or SG Pte. Ltd. |
| Japanese | **LOW** | Report >¥30,000,000 (~$200K USD); no hard limits | Any structure works |
| US / EU / HK / SG / UAE | **NONE** | Free capital movement | Choose based on tax/customers |

## Country-by-Country Rules

### China — STRICT (外汇管制)

#### Individual Limits

- **$50,000 USD/year** purchase limit (购汇额度) per person
- Applies to converting RMB to foreign currency
- Each transaction requires declaring purpose (travel, education, living expenses — NOT investment)
- **Cannot legally use individual quota for business purposes**
- Banks may reject or flag repeated near-limit transfers

#### Business (Company) Forex

- Legitimate trade payments: relatively smooth (with invoices + contracts)
- Capital account (investment, loans): requires SAFE (国家外汇管理局) approval
- Profit repatriation from overseas subsidiary: allowed with documentation
- ODI (境外直接投资): requires NDRC + MOFCOM + SAFE approval for amounts >$5M USD (smaller amounts vary by province)

#### Practical Strategies for Chinese Founders

1. **Hong Kong company** — No forex controls in HK; receive USD/EUR freely
2. **Keep money offshore** — Only remit living expenses to mainland
3. **Personal remittance** — Within $50K/year limit via bank transfer
4. **Salary from HK company** — Subject to HK salaries tax if work performed in HK
5. **Service fees** — HK company pays mainland 个体户 for services (needs contract + 发票)

#### CRS Impact

- China participates in CRS (Common Reporting Standard)
- Foreign bank accounts are automatically reported to Chinese tax authorities
- Applies to: HK, Singapore, most EU countries, many offshore centers
- **Notable exception:** US does not participate in CRS (but has FATCA)
- 2025 marks CRS enforcement expansion to mid-tier wealth brackets (<$1M assets)

#### Penalties

| Violation | Consequence |
|-----------|------------|
| Using individual quota for business | Accounts frozen, blacklisted from forex purchase for 2 years |
| Undeclared overseas income | Back taxes + penalties (50–500% of unpaid amount) |
| Illegal forex channels (地下钱庄) | Criminal offense — 5–10 years imprisonment for amounts >RMB 1,000,000 |
| Structuring transfers (蚂蚁搬家) | 30% fine on violation amount; 2-year forex purchase ban |

#### Mainland Bank Inbound Wire Risk Controls

Inbound wires to mainland bank accounts may trigger compliance review:

| Trigger | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Single transfer >$5,000 USD (frequent) | Human review likely |
| Single transfer >$50,000 USD | Mandatory human review |
| Multiple rapid transfers | Flagged as abnormal pattern |
| Mismatched declaration category | Automatic flag; may result in return of funds |

**Declaration categories for inbound wires:**

| Payment Nature | Declaration Category | Required Documents |
|----------------|---------------------|--------------------|
| Salary from HK company | 职工报酬 | Employment contract + payslip |
| Dividends from HK company | 利润汇回 | Shareholder resolution + articles |
| Service fees (个体户) | 服务贸易收入 | Service contract + VAT invoice |
| Personal living expenses | 经常转移 | Proof of family relationship |

---

### India — STRICT (FEMA / RBI)

#### Individual Limits (LRS — Liberalised Remittance Scheme)

- **$250,000 USD/year** per person for permissible capital and current account transactions
- Covers: investment abroad, gifts, maintenance, travel, education
- **Can be used to fund an overseas company** (investment under LRS)
- Requires: PAN card, A2 form through authorized dealer bank

#### Tax Collected at Source (TCS)

- **20% TCS on remittances >₹10 lakh/year** (effective April 2025; was ₹7 lakh)
- TCS is refundable against income tax liability — it is not a final tax
- Budget 2026 reduces education/medical TCS to 2%

#### Business Forex

- Current account (trade payments): generally free with documentation
- Capital account (ODI): RBI approval needed; automatic route available for most cases
- Round-tripping prohibition: sending money abroad and bringing it back is strictly monitored

#### Practical Strategies for Indian Founders

1. **Wyoming LLC + Mercury** — Fund via LRS ($250K limit usually sufficient for solo operations)
2. **Singapore Pte. Ltd.** — Popular for Asia-focused Indian founders (strong DTAA with India)
3. **Keep offshore revenue offshore** — Repatriate only what is needed
4. **Separate Indian entity** for domestic clients (Indian subsidiary for domestic revenue)

#### Indian Tax on Foreign Income

- India taxes **worldwide income** for residents
- Must declare: salary/fees from foreign company, dividends from owned foreign company, capital gains on foreign assets
- **DTAA relief:** India has DTAs with US, Singapore, UK, UAE — avoid double taxation
- **Form 67:** Required to claim foreign tax credit in India

---

### Brazil — STRICT

- Central Bank controls all forex transactions
- Individuals: up to $10,000 USD per day without documentation
- Companies: all transactions need exchange contract through authorized bank
- **IOF (Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras):** 0.38–6.38% on forex transactions
- Brazilian founders commonly use US LLC + Mercury to avoid domestic forex complexity

---

### Taiwan — MODERATE

#### Individual Limits

- **TWD 5,000,000** (~$150,000 USD)/year for individual outward remittance without declaration
- Above TWD 5,000,000: must file declaration with Central Bank
- This is a declaration threshold, NOT a hard cap (unlike China's strict quota)

#### Business Forex

- Generally free for trade transactions with documentation
- Investment abroad: report to Investment Commission (MOEA) for amounts >TWD 5,000,000
- **OBU (Offshore Banking Unit):** Tax-exempt interest income in OBU accounts

#### Practical Strategy

- **Hong Kong company** — Cultural proximity, cheaper than Singapore
- **OBU account** — For offshore income separation
- **Singapore** — If avoiding CFC triggers (SG 17% tax > Taiwan's 14% CFC threshold)

#### CFC Rules (2023+)

Holding >50% of a low-tax company (<14% effective rate) triggers deemed distribution for Taiwan tax. Exemption: real substance OR overseas income <NT$7,000,000.

## China-Specific: Mainland Income Reporting for Offshore Earners

### Annual Filing Window (汇算清缴)

- **Deadline:** March 1 – June 30 of following year (e.g., 2025 income reported by June 30, 2026)
- Filing path: 个税APP → 综合所得年度汇算 → 其他收入 → 境外所得（附表三）

### Foreign Tax Credit Calculation

```
Credit limit (per country) = China total tax × (income from that country / total worldwide income)
```

- If foreign tax paid ≤ credit limit → full credit; China collects the difference
- If foreign tax paid > credit limit → excess carries forward for 5 tax years (no refund)

### Penalties for Non-Reporting

| Scenario | Consequence |
|----------|------------|
| Discovered by tax authority | Back taxes + late payment surcharge (0.05%/day) + fine (50–500% of tax owed) |
| Voluntary self-correction | Late payment surcharge applies; fine typically reduced (<50%) |
| Tax evasion >RMB 100,000 AND >10% of tax due | Criminal liability (Article 201, Criminal Law) |

---

## CRS Response Protocol

When receiving a CRS inquiry letter from Chinese tax authorities:

| Letter Type | Urgency | Action |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| Compliance reminder (合规提示函) | Low | Self-audit, voluntary supplemental filing |
| Risk notice / interview summons (风险提示函/约谈通知) | Medium — respond within 30 days | Prepare HK company documents, bank statements, tax records |
| Formal audit notice (税务稽查通知书) | **High — engage tax attorney immediately** | Do not destroy any documents; attorney-led response |
