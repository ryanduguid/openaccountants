## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `cross-border-workflow-base`.** It covers stamp duties on documents, securities transfers, and the parallel financial transaction tax (FTT) regimes that economically resemble stamp duty.

- **Italian FTT** unchanged at 0.2% (regulated market) / 0.22% (OTC); derivatives schedule
- **French FTT** at 0.3% on French listed company shares (in-scope > EUR 1bn cap)
- **Spanish FTT (IFT)** at 0.2% on Spanish listed shares > EUR 1bn cap
- **Hong Kong stamp duty on shares** reduced 0.10% buyer + 0.10% seller (cut from 0.13% in November 2023)
- **Singapore ACD (Additional Conveyance Duty)** rules for property-rich entities
- **Indian Stamp Act** as substantively amended (federal stamp duties on securities since 2020 + state stamp duty on instruments)

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** Stamp duty assessments depend on precise document characterisation and jurisdiction. Every output must be reviewed by a credentialed local practitioner before any document is executed.

## Section 2 — UK Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT) and Stamp Duty

### 2.1 SDRT (FA 1986 Part IV)

**[T1] Rate**: 0.5% of consideration for the transfer of chargeable securities.

**Chargeable securities (s.99 FA 1986):** UK-incorporated company shares (and similar), some loan notes, units in unit trusts.

**Trigger**: agreement to transfer (regardless of whether share register is updated) settled through the CREST system → SDRT applied automatically; for off-CREST, payable via Stock Transfer Form + HMRC stamping.

### 2.2 Stamp duty on paper instruments

**[T1] Rate**: 0.5% of consideration; minimum stamp GBP 5. Applies when transfer effected by paper instrument (Stock Transfer Form).

### 2.3 The "1.5% charge" — depositary receipts and clearance services

**[T1] FA 1986 ss.67-70 / s.93:**
- 1.5% SDRT (or stamp duty) on issuance to:
  - A "depositary receipt issuer" (most commonly the bank issuing ADRs)
  - A "clearance service" (e.g., DTC for US investors)
- Confirmed by HMRC post-2009 CJEU HSBC ruling: the 1.5% on issuance is not generally enforced for EU/EEA destinations (CJEU C-569/07); however, HMRC's position post-Brexit and current administrative practice (FA 2024 amendments) treats issuance into Crest as not subject to 1.5%; complex issue requires specialist review

### 2.4 Exemptions

- Intra-group relief (s.42 FA 1930 / Sch 19 FA 1999): 0% for transfers within 75%+ group
- Demergers and reconstructions (ss.75-77 FA 1986)
- Loan capital (corporate debt) — most non-convertible debt
- Shares listed on a "recognised growth market" (AIM, AQSE Growth, certain SME markets) — 0% SDRT since 2014

### 2.5 Filing

- CREST: automatic
- Off-CREST: file STF with HMRC within 30 days of execution; instrument stamped

## Section 10 — Computation walk-through

### Example 1 — UK share acquisition

A UK private equity fund acquires GBP 50m of shares in a UK-incorporated AIM-listed company via CREST.

- AIM exemption applies → **0% SDRT** on the AIM portion
- Confirm AIM listing on relevant Recognised Growth Markets list as published by HMRC

### Example 2 — Italian listed share — non-resident purchaser

A French institutional buyer purchases EUR 10m of shares in Generali (Italy-listed, > EUR 500m market cap).

- Italian FTT: 0.2% × EUR 10m = **EUR 20,000**
- Italian intermediary remits; non-resident bears the cost

### Example 3 — Hong Kong share transfer

HKD 100m share transfer in a Hong Kong-incorporated private company.

- Buyer side: 0.10% × HKD 100m = **HKD 100,000**
- Seller side: 0.10% × HKD 100m = **HKD 100,000**
- Both parties pay; intermediated through IRD stamping

### Example 4 — Singapore share-acquisition with property-rich target

Foreign investor acquires 100% of a Singapore Pte Ltd whose >50% of total tangible assets is Singapore residential property.

- Basic transfer stamp duty: 0.2% × consideration
- ACD: applies to "significant owner" (≥50% of qualifying equity interest) acquisitions of "property-holding entities"; **up to 65%** total when combined with the underlying property's ABSD rates
- Specialist advice required; reviewer escalation

## Section 11 — Output specification

The reviewer brief must include:

1. **Transaction classification** — document type, instrument, security, financial transaction
2. **Stamp / FTT analysis** per applicable jurisdiction
3. **Rate and base** with statutory citation
4. **Exemption analysis** — intra-group relief, market making, primary issuance, listed status
5. **Liable party** (buyer / seller / both / intermediary withholding)
6. **Filing mechanics** — when, how, by whom
7. **Reviewer questions** — open items flagged as [T2] or [T3]

---

## Section 12 — Self-checks

- [ ] Document characterisation tested per local taxonomy (each country has distinct "instruments" list)
- [ ] Each transaction party's stamp duty position computed separately (buyer vs seller)
- [ ] Intra-group relief documentary requirements confirmed (75% common ownership for UK)
- [ ] AIM / recognised growth market exemption (UK) confirmed against current list
- [ ] French / Italian / Spanish FTT scope confirmed against current annual list
- [ ] Hong Kong rate (0.10% per side; 0.13% old rate not applied post-November 2023)
- [ ] Singapore ACD tested for property-rich entity transfers
- [ ] India federal + state stamp duty stacked correctly
- [ ] Brazil IOF / Argentina sellos / Chile timbres per applicable transaction type
- [ ] Output flags every [T2]/[T3] item for reviewer judgement

---

## Section 13 — Prohibitions

- **Do not** apply the old 0.13% Hong Kong stamp duty rate to transactions executed after November 2023 — the rate is 0.10% per side.
- **Do not** assume UK intra-group relief applies without confirming 75% common beneficial ownership AND the relief application has been correctly notified.
- **Do not** advise that AIM-listed shares are exempt without confirming the listing is on a HMRC-recognised growth market.
- **Do not** ignore Italian / French / Spanish FTT for non-resident purchasers — the tax is at the security level, not the purchaser's residence.
- **Do not** apply property-rich entity rules (Singapore ACD, Australian landholder duty) without confirming the threshold (typically 50% of tangible assets) and qualifying equity interest tests.
