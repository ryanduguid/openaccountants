# Free Zones / SEZ / IBC Matrix v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `cross-border-workflow-base`.** It maps the world's principal free zones, special economic zones, and offshore financial centers as of mid-2025.

**Tax year coverage.** Current for **fiscal year 2025**, reflecting:
- **UAE Corporate Tax Law (Federal Decree-Law No. 47 of 2022)** in full force; "Qualifying Free Zone Person" (QFZP) regime under Ministerial Decision 139/2023 and Cabinet Decision 100/2023
- **Saudi Arabia SEZs** (Riyadh ILBZ, NEOM, KAEC, Jazan, Ras Al Khair, Cloud Computing) under RFAGZ Authority 2023
- **Hainan Free Trade Port** corporate tax incentives extending through 31 December 2025
- **OECD BEPS Action 5** and Pillar Two interaction — many free-zone rates are below 15% and trigger top-up tax

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** Free zone incorporation decisions are nearly impossible to reverse without exit cost. Every output must be reviewed by a credentialed local tax counsel before any incorporation, restructuring, or onshore-vs-zone election.

## Section 2 — UAE Free Zones

The UAE has ~45 free zones plus three financial center zones (DIFC, ADGM, QFC). Since the Federal Corporate Tax Law took effect for periods starting 1 June 2023 (most companies: FY 2024), all UAE entities (including free zone) are subject to CIT — but Qualifying Free Zone Persons (QFZPs) can benefit from a **0% rate on Qualifying Income**.

### 2.1 Qualifying Free Zone Person (QFZP) regime

**[T1] To qualify as a QFZP (Cabinet Decision 100/2023 Article 4):**
1. Maintain adequate substance in the UAE (Article 7 of the Corporate Tax Law)
2. Derive Qualifying Income (Ministerial Decision 139/2023)
3. Not have elected to be subject to the standard 9% rate
4. Comply with the arm's length principle and transfer pricing rules
5. Maintain audited financial statements
6. Meet the de minimis requirement (non-qualifying revenue ≤ AED 5m or 5% of total revenue, lower)

**[T1] Qualifying Income (Ministerial Decision 139/2023 / 265/2023 / 55/2023 amended):**

| Income type | Status |
|---|---|
| Transactions with other Free Zone Persons (except excluded activities) | Qualifying |
| Qualifying activities with non-Free Zone persons | Qualifying (subject to list — manufacturing, processing, holding shares/securities, ship management, fund management, wealth management, headquarters services, treasury and financing to related parties, distribution from a Designated Zone, certain logistics, certain processing) |
| Excluded activities (treated as non-qualifying even if otherwise within list) | Banking, insurance, finance & leasing (with non-related parties), ownership/exploitation of immovable property other than commercial property within a Free Zone, intellectual property (with exceptions for qualifying patents per Article 8 MD 139/2023) |
| Other income | Non-qualifying |

**[T1] Substance test (Article 7):**
- Premises in the UAE adequate to the level of activity
- Adequate qualified employees
- Adequate operating expenditure
- The Core Income Generating Activities (CIGA) must be conducted in the UAE

### 2.2 UAE Free Zone matrix

| **ADGM** | Abu Dhabi (FSRA, common law) | Financial services, fintech, virtual assets | 0% on Qualifying Income (else 9%) | Common law direct application; Crypto regulator; Variable Capital Company structure |
| **DMCC** | Dubai (Jumeirah Lakes Towers) | Commodities trading, services | 0% / 9% | World's most-awarded FZ; gold/diamond/crypto licensing |
| **JAFZA** | Dubai (Jebel Ali Port) | Logistics, manufacturing | 0% / 9% | Designated Zone for VAT purposes |
| **DAFZA** | Dubai Airport | Light manufacturing, services | 0% / 9% | n/a |

| **RAKEZ** | Ras Al Khaimah | Industrial, services | 0% / 9% | Low-cost mainland-of-RAK regime |
| **RAK ICC** | Ras Al Khaimah | International Business Companies (offshore-style) | Not a typical FZ; international company regime; 0% CIT but separate from QFZP rules | Offshore holding vehicle |

| **Ajman FZ** | Ajman | Light manufacturing | 0% / 9% | n/a |

**[T2] Onshore-mainland trading.** A QFZP may sell to mainland UAE customers only through a mainland distributor OR via the QFZP de minimis (≤ AED 5m / 5%). Direct sales to mainland customers above de minimis convert the relevant revenue to standard 9%.

## Section 3 — Saudi Arabia SEZs

**[T1] Saudi Arabia's Royal Commission for AlUla / SEZ Authority** created four "general" SEZs in April 2023 (King Abdullah Economic City, Jazan, Ras Al Khair, Cloud Computing) plus NEOM and the Riyadh Integrated Logistics Bonded Zone (ILBZ).

| SEZ | Sector focus | CIT | Withholding | Customs |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) SEZ** | Manufacturing, ICT, logistics | **5%** CIT for 20 years | 0% on dividends, interest, royalties to non-residents (under conditions) | 0% customs on goods kept within zone |
| **Jazan SEZ** | Manufacturing, food, mining | **5%** CIT for 20 years | 0% withholding (conditions) | 0% customs within zone |
| **Ras Al Khair SEZ** | Maritime, shipbuilding, MRO | **5%** CIT for 20 years | 0% withholding (conditions) | 0% customs within zone |
| **Cloud Computing SEZ** | Cloud, data centers | **5%** CIT for 20 years | 0% withholding (conditions) | n/a |
| **NEOM** | Energy, tourism, urban tech, oxygen-based | Special bespoke regime — case-by-case | n/a yet | n/a |
| **Riyadh ILBZ** | Logistics, bonded re-export | 0% CIT for 50 years | 0% withholding (conditions) | 0% customs |

**[T1] Saudi Pillar Two overlay.** Saudi has not yet adopted Pillar Two. For in-scope MNE groups, the low SEZ rate produces top-up tax exposure under IIR / UTPR in parent jurisdictions.

## Section 9 — Mechanics — substance test (universal pattern)

**[T1]** Every modern zone regime requires demonstrable substance:

| Employees | Adequate count + qualifications; CIGAs performed by employees in zone |
| Operating expenditure | Adequate in-zone OPEX; can include outsourced services subject to control |
| Decision-making | Strategic decisions taken in zone (board meetings, key personnel resident) |
| Records | Maintained in zone, available to regulator |

**[T1] Economic Substance Regulations (ESA)** applied in BVI, Cayman, Bermuda, Bahamas, Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Anguilla, TCI, Mauritius — for "relevant activities" (banking, distribution, headquarters, finance/leasing, fund management, holding, IP, insurance, shipping). Failure to satisfy: penalties, public-register exposure, mandatory exchange to tax authorities of beneficial owner's country.

---

## Section 10 — Pillar Two interaction

**[T1]** Free zone regimes producing ETRs below 15% trigger Pillar Two Top-up Tax for MNE groups with consolidated revenue ≥ EUR 750m (see `pillar-two-globe-minimum-tax.md`).

| Zone family | Pillar Two response |
|---|---|
| **UAE** | UAE introduced Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) effective 1 January 2025 (Cabinet Decision 142/2024). QFZPs continue at 0% but DMTT applies to bring jurisdictional ETR to 15% for in-scope groups. |

| **Bahamas** | 15% DMTT from 2024. |

| **Singapore** | DTT (QDMTT) and IIR from 2025; UTPR not yet enacted. |
| **Madeira IBC** | Portugal QDMTT under EU Directive; benefits clawed back for in-scope groups. |

## Section 11 — Output specification

The reviewer brief must include:

1. **Zone selection rationale** — why this zone vs alternatives; commercial fit.
2. **Qualifying activity confirmation** — every revenue stream classified within the zone's qualifying list.
3. **Substance plan** — premises, employees, OPEX, decision-making with named individuals and minimum headcount.
4. **De minimis tracking** — non-qualifying revenue forecast and headroom under cap.
5. **Onshore-mainland trading plan** — distributor structure (UAE) or DTA mechanics (India).
6. **Withholding tax position** on inbound and outbound flows; treaty access analysis.
7. **Pillar Two analysis** — group revenue test; if in-scope, model the top-up tax under DMTT and at parent level.
8. **Economic Substance Regulations compliance** (where applicable).
9. **Reviewer questions** — open items flagged as [T2] or [T3].

## Section 12 — Self-checks

- [ ] Zone regime tested for OECD FHTP harmful-tax-practice status (not removed from approved list).
- [ ] Qualifying activity confirmed against the zone's published qualifying list, not assumed by analogy.
- [ ] De minimis cap applied (UAE QFZP 5%/AED 5m, others as specified).
- [ ] Substance plan documents adequate premises, headcount, OPEX.
- [ ] Pillar Two scope test (EUR 750m) applied; DMTT and top-up modelled.
- [ ] Onshore-mainland sale routing documented; arm's length pricing confirmed.
- [ ] Treaty access (LOB, beneficial ownership, principal purpose test) tested for major withholding flows.
- [ ] Economic Substance Regulations compliance documented for ESA-relevant zones.
- [ ] Audited financials and TP documentation obligations noted.
- [ ] Output flags every [T2]/[T3] item for reviewer judgement.

---

## Section 13 — Prohibitions

- **Do not** advise on incorporating in a zone whose regime has been removed from the OECD FHTP approved list without confirming current status.
- **Do not** treat a non-qualifying activity as qualifying because related activities are listed — the regime is enumeration-based.
- **Do not** assume the de minimis cap allows mainland sales — the cap is on revenue, not transactions.
- **Do not** ignore Pillar Two top-up tax for groups above the EUR 750m threshold — the zone benefit may be clawed back in full.
- **Do not** advise on holding IP in a free zone without checking the country's IP-box overlay rules and BEPS Action 5 nexus requirements.
- **Do not** promise treaty access without testing the relevant LOB / PPT clauses.
