## Section 1: General Principle — Whose Rules Govern the Invoice?

### The Basic Rule — Article 219a(1) [T1]

**Invoicing follows the rules of the Member State where the supply is deemed to take place** (i.e., the place-of-supply country).

### The Exceptions — Article 219a(2) [T1]

| Exception | When It Applies | Whose Rules |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| **(a) Reverse charge — supplier not established in supply country** | B2B intra-EU services where customer self-assesses VAT (Art 196) | **Supplier's** country sets the invoicing rules |
| **(b) Supply outside the EU** | Services deemed supplied outside the EU | **Supplier's** country sets the invoicing rules |
| **Self-billing under reverse charge** | Customer issues the invoice on behalf of the supplier | Place-of-supply country's rules apply (basic rule) |
| **Non-EU supplier making taxable supplies in EU** | Non-EU seller with EU-taxable transactions | Place-of-supply country's rules always apply (no exception) |

### Practical Impact [T1]

| Scenario | Whose Invoicing Rules? |
|----------|----------------------|
| German consultant invoices French company (B2B reverse charge) | **Germany** (supplier's rules — exception (a)) |
| French company sells goods domestically | **France** (place of supply = France) |
| Italian company invoices US client for consulting | **Italy** (supply outside EU — exception (b)) |
| US company sells SaaS to French consumer via non-Union OSS | **France** (place of supply = France; non-EU supplier — no exception) |
| Dutch company issues self-billing invoice for services received from Malta under reverse charge | **Netherlands** (self-billing under reverse charge = basic rule) |

---

## Section 2: EU Cross-Border Invoicing (Intra-EU B2B)

### Mandatory Invoice Content for Intra-EU B2B Under Reverse Charge [T1]

**Legislation:** VAT Directive Art 226.

Every VAT invoice in the EU must include these elements. For reverse charge invoices, additional requirements apply:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Invoice number | Sequential, unique |
| Date of issue | Date the invoice is created |
| Date of supply | Date the service was performed or goods delivered (if different from issue date) |
| Supplier identification | Full name, address, VAT identification number |
| Customer identification | Full name, address, **VAT identification number** (verified via VIES) |
| Description | Nature and quantity of goods supplied or extent and nature of services |
| Taxable amount | Net amount in the agreed currency |
| VAT rate | N/A for reverse charge (0%) |
| VAT amount | EUR 0.00 or blank |
| **Reverse charge notation** | **Mandatory.** Must state "Reverse charge" or equivalent in the relevant language |
| Reference to legislation | "Article 196, Council Directive 2006/112/EC" or national equivalent |

### Reverse Charge Notation by Country [T1]

| Country | Notation |
|---------|----------|
| English | "Reverse charge — Article 196, Council Directive 2006/112/EC" |
| German | "Steuerschuldnerschaft des Leistungsempfängers — § 13b UStG" |
| French | "Autoliquidation — Article 196, Directive 2006/112/CE" |
| Italian | "Inversione contabile — Art. 196, Direttiva 2006/112/CE" |
| Spanish | "Inversión del sujeto pasivo — Artículo 196, Directiva 2006/112/CE" |
| Dutch | "BTW verlegd — Artikel 196, Richtlijn 2006/112/EG" |
| Portuguese | "Autoliquidação — Artigo 196.º, Diretiva 2006/112/CE" |

### Time Limits for Issuing Invoices [T1]

The VAT Directive requires invoices to be issued by the **15th of the month following** the month in which the supply took place (Art 222). Individual member states may impose shorter deadlines.

| Country | Deadline |
|---------|----------|
| Germany | Immediately, but no later than 6 months after supply (§14 UStG) |
| France | By the 15th of the following month |
| Italy | By the 15th of the following month (12th for immediate invoices) |
| Spain | By the 15th of the following month |
| Netherlands | Before the 15th of the following month |
| Belgium | By the 15th of the following month |

## Section 3: Reverse Charge Invoice Requirements

### What Changes on the Invoice When Reverse Charge Applies [T1]

| Normal Invoice | Reverse Charge Invoice |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Shows VAT rate (e.g., 19%) | Shows 0% or no VAT line |
| Shows VAT amount (e.g., EUR 950) | Shows EUR 0.00 or omits VAT amount |
| No special notation needed | **Must include reverse charge notation** |
| Only supplier's VAT number required | **Both** supplier and customer VAT numbers required |
| Customer pays gross amount | Customer pays net amount only |

### Customer's Obligations Upon Receiving a Reverse Charge Invoice [T1]

1. **Self-assess output VAT** at local rate on the net amount
2. **Claim input VAT** on the same return (if entitled — fully taxable business)
3. Both entries must appear on the VAT return (see `eu-reverse-charge.md` for box mappings)
4. Report on Intrastat / acquisition reporting if required by the member state

### Common Mistakes [T1]

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|------------|
| Supplier charges domestic VAT instead of reverse charge | Customer pays VAT they shouldn't. Double taxation risk if customer also self-assesses. Supplier must issue credit note. |
| Missing reverse charge notation | Invoice does not meet legal requirements. Customer's tax authority may deny input VAT deduction. |
| Customer's VAT number not on invoice | Cannot prove B2B nature. Tax authority may reclassify as B2C. |
| Supplier doesn't verify VAT number via VIES | If number is invalid, reverse charge does not apply. Supplier liable for domestic VAT. |

---

## Section 4: Multi-Currency Invoicing

### Which Currency for VAT Calculation? [T1]

| Jurisdiction | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| **EU (VAT Directive Art 230)** | VAT amount must be expressed in the currency of the Member State where the supply takes place. If invoiced in a foreign currency, convert using ECB rate or national customs rate. |
| **ECB exchange rate** | Use the rate on the **date of the chargeable event** (typically date of supply). Alternatively, some member states accept the rate on the date of invoice. |
| **UK** | HMRC accepts the rate at the date of supply. Use HMRC, ECB, or a reputable financial source. |
| **US** | No VAT — but for sales tax, use the exchange rate on the date of transaction. |

### Practical Guidance for Multi-Currency Invoices [T1]

| Element | Best Practice |
|---------|--------------|
| Invoice currency | Invoice in whatever currency the contract specifies (USD, GBP, EUR, etc.) |
| VAT amount | Convert to the local currency using the applicable exchange rate |
| Exchange rate source | ECB daily rate (EU), HMRC rate (UK), Federal Reserve rate (US) |
| Document the rate | State the exchange rate and source on the invoice or in your records |
| Consistency | Use the same exchange rate source consistently — switching sources can trigger audit queries |

### OSS Returns and Currency [T1]

| Scheme | Currency Required |
|--------|------------------|
| Union OSS / Non-Union OSS | EUR. If your MSI doesn't use EUR, convert at ECB rate on the last day of the quarter. |
| IOSS | EUR |
| Domestic VAT return | Local currency of the member state |

---

## Section 5: Self-Billing / Recipient-Created Invoices Cross-Border

### What Is Self-Billing? [T1]

Self-billing (or recipient-created tax invoice) is where the **customer** issues the invoice on behalf of the supplier. This is permitted under Art 224 of the VAT Directive, subject to conditions.

### Conditions for Self-Billing [T1]

| Condition | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Prior agreement | Supplier and customer must have a **written agreement** that the customer will issue invoices on the supplier's behalf |
| Acceptance procedure | There must be a mechanism for the supplier to accept or reject each invoice |
| Invoicing rules | Follow the rules of the **place-of-supply** country (Art 219a basic rule applies to self-billing under reverse charge) |

### Cross-Border Self-Billing [T2]

| Scenario | Whose Rules? |
|----------|-------------|
| Dutch customer self-bills for services received from Italian supplier (reverse charge) | **Netherlands** (place of supply = Netherlands; self-billing under reverse charge follows basic rule, not supplier's rules) |
| US customer self-bills for services from German supplier | **Germany** (supply outside EU — exception (b) — supplier's rules) |

### Common Use Cases

- Large retailers issuing invoices to many small suppliers
- Royalty payments where recipient calculates the amount
- Commission arrangements where the principal issues invoices to agents

---

## Section 6: Credit Notes and Corrections Cross-Border

### When to Issue a Credit Note [T1]

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Price reduction after supply | Issue credit note referencing original invoice |
| Return of goods | Issue credit note for returned items |
| Invoice error (wrong amount, wrong VAT) | Issue credit note + new corrected invoice |
| Retrospective discount (e.g., volume rebate) | Issue credit note at end of period |

### Credit Note Requirements (EU) [T1]

**Legislation:** VAT Directive Art 219.

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Format | "Any document or message that amends and refers specifically and unambiguously to the initial invoice" |
| Reference | Must cite the original invoice number and date |
| Content | Corrected amounts, including VAT adjustments |
| Reverse charge credit notes | Same reverse charge notation as original. Customer must reverse their self-assessment. |

### Cross-Border Credit Note Complications [T2]

| Issue | Guidance |
|-------|---------|
| Different reporting periods | Credit note may fall in a different quarter from the original invoice. Report in the period the credit note is issued. |
| OSS corrections | Corrections to previous OSS quarters are made on the **next** regular quarterly return (not by amending the original). |
| Currency differences | If exchange rate has changed since the original invoice, use the rate at the date of the credit note for the adjustment. |
| Customer in a different country has already filed | Customer must adjust their VAT return in the period the credit note is received. |

---

## Section 7: Country-Specific E-Invoicing Quirks

### Italy — SDI (Sistema di Interscambio) [T1]

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Mandate | All Italian-established businesses must issue e-invoices via SDI (since 2019 for domestic; since July 2022 for cross-border) |
| Cross-border sales | Italian businesses must submit an XML e-invoice to SDI even when invoicing foreign customers. The Esterometro was abolished in 2022; replaced by SDI reporting. |
| Format | FatturaPA XML format. SDI validates the invoice before forwarding. |
| Foreign supplier selling to Italy | Not required to use SDI (unless established in Italy). The Italian buyer self-assesses VAT and reports via SDI using document types TD17–TD19. |
| 2026 update | SDI technical specs v1.9.1 effective May 15, 2026. New validation checks (error 00327 for VAT Groups). |
| ViDA impact | EU ViDA Directive will require alignment with EN16931 standard. Italy's SdI clearance model may need adaptation by 2035. |

### India — IRN (Invoice Reference Number) [T1]

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Mandate | E-invoicing mandatory for businesses with turnover ≥₹5 crore (since August 2023) |
| Cross-border exports | Export invoices must also be reported to the Invoice Registration Portal (IRP) and receive an IRN. Tax invoice must include QR code. |
| Format | JSON schema submitted to IRP. IRP validates, generates IRN + QR code, digitally signs. |
| Foreign supplier to India | Not required to use IRP. Indian buyer handles GST under reverse charge. |
| Key fields for exports | Supply type = "EXPWP" (export with payment of IGST) or "EXPWOP" (export without payment — under LUT). Shipping bill details required. |

### Mexico — CFDI (Comprobante Fiscal Digital por Internet) [T1]

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Mandate | All invoices by Mexican-established entities must be CFDI 4.0 format, issued through a PAC (Authorized Certification Provider) with real-time SAT clearance |
| Cross-border sales | Mexican entity invoicing a foreign client not registered with SAT must still generate a CFDI through the clearance process. Use RFC "XEXX010101000" for foreign recipients. |
| Foreign supplier to Mexico | Not required to issue CFDI. Mexican buyer may need to issue a CFDI for the foreign payment (complemento de pagos). |
| Penalties | Non-compliance: 5%–10% of invoice amount. Fraudulent CFDI: criminal liability (prison). SAT has expedited powers to suspend digital certificates. |
| Complements | Specific transaction types require CFDI complements: payroll (nómina), foreign trade (comercio exterior), payments (pagos), tax withholdings (retenciones). |

### EU ViDA (VAT in the Digital Age) — Phased Rollout [T1]

| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| July 2028 | Deemed supplier rules for platforms (accommodation, transport). Strengthened reverse charge. |
| July 2030 | **Mandatory e-invoicing for intra-EU B2B transactions.** Digital reporting requirements. E-invoicing becomes default form. EN16931 standard. |
| 2035 | Italy's SdI derogation expires. Full ViDA alignment required. |

## Section 8: Archiving Obligations When Invoicing Cross-Border

### Whose Retention Rules Apply? [T1]

**Legislation:** VAT Directive Articles 244–248.

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **General principle** | Each member state sets its own retention period and format requirements for invoices related to supplies made in its territory. |
| **Supplier** | Must retain copies of issued invoices per the rules of the member state where they are established. |
| **Customer** | Must retain received invoices per the rules of the member state where they are established. |
| **Cross-border** | Both parties retain under their own country's rules. If these differ, the stricter rule is the safest approach. |

### Retention Periods by Country [T1]

| Country | Retention Period | Format |
|---------|-----------------|--------|
| Germany | **10 years** (§14b UStG) | Original format (paper or electronic). Electronic invoices must remain in electronic form. |
| France | **10 years** (Art L102B, Livre des Procédures Fiscales) | Electronic invoices in original electronic format |
| Italy | **10 years** (Art 2220, Codice Civile) | Must be stored via approved electronic conservation ("conservazione sostitutiva") |
| Spain | **4 years** (Art 29.2, Ley General Tributaria) + additional years if open audit | Original format |
| Netherlands | **7 years** (Art 52 AWR) | Original format |
| UK | **6 years** (VAT Regulations 1995) | Original format |
| Belgium | **7 years** (Art 60 Code TVA) | Original format |
| US | **Varies by state** — typically 3–7 years for sales tax; 7 years recommended | Any legible format |

### Key Principles for Cross-Border Archiving [T1]

| Principle | Guidance |
|-----------|---------|
| **Authenticity of origin** | You must be able to prove who issued the invoice (digital signature, EDI, internal controls) |
| **Integrity of content** | The invoice content must not have been altered after issue |
| **Legibility** | The invoice must be readable (human or machine) throughout the retention period |
| **Storage location** | EU: May store outside the member state, but must provide online access to the tax authority on request (Art 247) |
| **Language** | Some countries (France, Germany, Italy) may require invoices to be in the local language or translatable on request during audit |

---

## PROHIBITIONS

1. **NEVER** issue an intra-EU B2B reverse charge invoice without the mandatory notation. The invoice is legally deficient without it.
2. **NEVER** assume the supplier's country rules always apply. Check Art 219a — the basic rule is place-of-supply country.
3. **NEVER** invoice in a foreign currency without documenting the exchange rate used for VAT conversion.
4. **NEVER** issue a credit note without referencing the original invoice number and date.
5. **NEVER** assume foreign suppliers to Italy don't need to worry about SDI — if established in Italy, SDI is mandatory.
6. **NEVER** treat Mexican CFDI requirements as optional for cross-border sales by Mexican entities.
7. **NEVER** destroy electronic invoices and store only paper copies. Many jurisdictions require retention in original electronic format.
8. **NEVER** assume one retention period fits all. Apply the rules of your own country AND consider the rules of the transaction country.
