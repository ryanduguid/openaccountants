description: >
  Tier 1 workflow base for corporate income tax skills serving small, medium, and large companies across jurisdictions. Contains the workflow runbook, conservative defaults principle, structured intake form, reviewer-oriented output spec, self-checks, global refusal catalogue, citation discipline, and content skill slot contract. Workflow architecture only — no tax content, no rates, no thresholds, no form line references, no year-specific figures. MUST be loaded alongside at least one content skill that provides actual corporate income tax rules and current-year figures for a specific jurisdiction. Assumes a human reviewer credentialed under the local equivalent of Circular 230 (CPA, CA, CTA, EA, Chartered Tax Advisor, Steuerberater, expert-comptable, commercialista, etc.) reviews and signs off on every output before it reaches the taxpayer or the tax authority.

# Corporate Income Tax Workflow Base v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

This is the **Tier 1 workflow base** for any corporate income tax content skill. It does not contain country-specific tax rules. It contains:

- The standard runbook for preparing a corporate income tax computation, return, and reviewer brief
- The structured intake form for gathering inputs from a corporate client
- The output specification for a reviewer-ready working paper
- The global refusal catalogue — situations a content skill must escalate to a credentialed practitioner without computing
- The 18 self-checks
- The citation discipline
- The Pillar Two interaction protocol
- The slot contract that every country-level content skill must fill

**Every corporate income tax skill MUST be loaded alongside this base.**

---

## Section 1 — Audience and assumptions

This base assumes:

- The **taxpayer** is a **corporation** (incorporated entity) — not a partnership, trust, sole proprietorship, or individual
- The **filing currency** is the corporation's functional currency
- The corporation maintains accounting records under either local GAAP or IFRS (see `ifrs-local-gaap-reconciliation.md` for reconciliation)
- A **credentialed reviewer** (CPA / CA / CTA / Steuerberater / equivalent) reviews and signs off on every output before it is filed
- The corporation is in scope for the country's general corporate income tax — NOT a special regime (banking, insurance, REIT, fund, oil and gas, mining, shipping, aviation, charity — these require sector skills)

---

## Section 2 — The runbook

### Step 0 — Onboarding (always first)

Run the intake form (Section 4). Confirm:
- Country of incorporation
- Country of tax residence (place of effective management — POEM)
- Filing year-end date
- Corporate size and threshold tests (small / medium / large / MNE)
- Accounting framework (local GAAP / IFRS / Ind AS / etc.)
- Any consolidated / group tax filing status (Organschaft, intégration fiscale, group relief, etc.)
- Any in-scope regime overlays (Pillar Two, CFC, BEAT, GILTI)

If any of: cross-border activities; multiple shareholders with different tax residences; loss-making with restructuring; ongoing audit; M&A in the year → flag to reviewer before computation.

### Step 1 — Reconcile accounting profit to tax profit

Start from the audited / approved profit-before-tax (PBT) per the corporation's accounting framework. Walk through:

| Adjustment category | Direction | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Non-deductible expenses | Add back | Fines, penalties, certain entertainment |
| Tax-exempt income | Subtract | Inter-corporate dividends within participation exemption; certain investment income |
| Timing differences | ± | Depreciation (book vs tax), provisions, IFRS leases |
| Disallowed depreciation / interest | ± | Interest deduction limitations |
| Loss utilization | ± | Brought-forward losses; group relief |
| GAAR / anti-abuse override | If applicable | Refer to reviewer |

### Step 2 — Apply jurisdiction-specific rate

Apply the headline corporate income tax rate from the content skill. Where multiple rates apply (small-company rate, lower rate on first slice, surcharges), apply per the content skill's bracket schedule.

### Step 3 — Apply credits and offsets

- R&D credits (see `rd-tax-credits-matrix.md`)
- Patent / IP box benefit (see `ip-patent-box-matrix.md`)
- Foreign tax credits
- Group relief utilisation
- Withholding tax credits on receipts
- Anti-double taxation relief

### Step 4 — Compute and reconcile

- Tax liability before payments
- Less: provisional / advance payments made during the year
- Less: foreign tax credit utilisation
- Net tax payable / refundable

Reconcile to the corporation's accounting tax provision (current + deferred). Document material variances.

### Step 5 — Pillar Two overlay (if applicable)

If the corporation is part of an MNE group with consolidated revenue ≥ EUR 750m (or local-equivalent threshold), apply the Pillar Two analysis from `pillar-two-globe-minimum-tax.md`:
- Compute Adjusted Covered Taxes
- Compute GloBE Income
- Compute jurisdictional ETR
- Apply SBIE and de minimis
- Compute Top-up Tax (IIR / UTPR / QDMTT)

### Step 6 — Cross-border overlays

If the corporation has cross-border activity:
- **Permanent establishment risk** — see `permanent-establishment-risk.md`
- **Withholding tax on outbound payments** — see `withholding-tax-matrix.md`
- **CFC inclusion** — apply local CFC rules
- **BEPS Action 5 IP regime nexus** — see `ip-patent-box-matrix.md`
- **DAC6 / MDR reporting** — see `dac6-mdr-reportable-arrangements.md`
- **CbCR / Action 13** — see CbCR skill (forthcoming)
- **Transfer pricing documentation** — see `transfer-pricing-workflow-base.md`

### Step 7 — Deferred tax provision

Compute the deferred tax position under local GAAP / IFRS:
- Identify all timing differences (book-tax basis differences)
- Apply applicable tax rate (typically substantively enacted future rate)
- Recognise DTAs to the extent recoverable
- Track 5-year DTL recapture risk for Pillar Two (DTLs that do not reverse within 5 years are added back)

### Step 8 — Filing assembly

Produce:
- The return / forms required by the jurisdiction
- The reviewer brief (Section 5)
- The tax provision schedule for the audit
- The tax payment schedule
- The supporting documentation index

## Section 3 — Conservative defaults principle

When uncertain about any position, choose the treatment that costs more or imposes stricter compliance, never less. Your reviewer can correct an over-conservative position. They cannot easily recover from an aggressive one.

Applied to corporate income tax:
- Where a deduction is uncertain → flag, do not claim
- Where income classification is uncertain → use the higher-taxed classification
- Where a provision could be deductible OR non-deductible → exclude from claim, document the alternative
- Where an exemption is uncertain → treat as taxable
- Where treaty access is uncertain → withhold at domestic rate
- Where loss carryforward is uncertain → defer recognition of the DTA

---

## Section 4 — Structured intake form

| **R-CIT-3** | Corporation is in extractive industries with country-by-country reporting under EU CbCR Directive — load sector skill |
| **R-CIT-4** | Corporation is in shipping / aviation tonnage tax regime — load sector skill |
| **R-CIT-5** | Corporation is a charity / nonprofit — load nonprofit skill |
| **R-CIT-6** | Tax authority is currently auditing or has issued a notice of deficiency — controversy strategy first |
| **R-CIT-7** | The user is requesting an aggressive position (GAAR risk) — reviewer must approve |
| **R-CIT-8** | M&A transaction with material tax-free reorganisation election — reviewer must approve |
| **R-CIT-9** | The corporation's tax residence is in dispute (POEM, treaty tie-breaker) — escalate |
| **R-CIT-10** | The corporation is in liquidation or insolvency — separate procedural rules |
| **R-CIT-11** | The Pillar Two threshold is met but the country has not yet enacted Pillar Two — escalate, complex |
| **R-CIT-12** | The corporation has dual-resident status or hybrid mismatches — escalate |

## Section 8 — Citation discipline

Every figure in the reviewer brief must trace to:
- A statutory section (e.g., IRC §163(j), CGI Article 209, KStG §8, ITA §247)
- A regulatory citation (Treas. Reg., DGFiP BOI, HMRC manual, ATO PCG)
- A judicial decision where positional
- The corporation's accounting records line item (general ledger account, journal entry)

No figure may rely on "general practice" or "common interpretation" without explicit reviewer escalation.
