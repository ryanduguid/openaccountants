name: statutory-audit-workflow-base
description: >
  Tier 1 workflow base for statutory audit skills. Covers the audit lifecycle — engagement acceptance, risk assessment, audit planning, evidence gathering, fieldwork, opinion formulation, reporting — applied to the International Standards on Auditing (ISA) as issued by the IAASB plus country overlays (US GAAS for public co's, UK FRC ISA(UK), Germany IDW PS, France NEP, Italy ISA-Italia). Workflow architecture only — no engagement-specific procedures, materiality benchmarks, or audit programs. MUST be loaded alongside a content skill that provides the country-specific audit threshold rules, regulator inspection regime, statutory deadlines, and any non-ISA local standards. Assumes a qualified statutory auditor (RA, CPA, CA, Wirtschaftsprüfer, commissaire aux comptes, revisore legale, etc.) signs the audit report. Does NOT cover: internal audit, regulatory audit (banking, insurance prudential), tax audit by tax authority, IT general controls testing methodology, or forensic audit.

# Statutory Audit Workflow Base v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

This is the **Tier 1 workflow base** for statutory audit content skills. It does not contain country-specific audit rules. It contains:

- The audit lifecycle runbook aligned to ISA (IAASB)
- The country audit threshold matrix (when an audit is required)
- The engagement acceptance and continuance protocol
- The ISA risk assessment and significance-determination framework
- The reviewer-oriented audit file structure
- The opinion formulation decision tree
- The 21 self-checks
- The global refusal catalogue
- The slot contract for country statutory audit skills

**Every statutory audit skill MUST be loaded alongside this base.**

## Section 1 — Audit lifecycle (ISA-aligned)

### Phase 1 — Engagement acceptance / continuance (ISA 220, 220R, 210)

**[T1]** Before accepting or continuing:

| Test | Reference |
|---|---|
| Independence (firm-level + engagement team) | IESBA Code Part 4A; PCAOB Rule 3520; FRC ES 1; IDW PS 220 |
| Competence to perform the audit | ISA 220 ¶15 |
| Acceptance approval by appropriate partner | Firm policy; ISA 220 ¶16 |
| Engagement letter signed | ISA 210 ¶10 |
| Predecessor auditor communication | ISA 510 (initial engagements); communication with predecessor required |
| Audit fee not impaired (no contingent fees on the audit opinion) | IESBA Code 410 |

### Phase 2 — Risk assessment (ISA 315 (Revised 2019))

**[T1] Required activities:**
- Understand the entity, its environment, and its system of internal control
- Identify and assess Risks of Material Misstatement (RMM) at financial statement and assertion levels
- Determine significant risks
- Identify controls relevant to the audit

**[T1] Significant risks** receive enhanced procedures and cannot be addressed with substantive analytical procedures alone.

### Phase 3 — Audit plan and materiality (ISA 320, 330)

**[T1] Materiality:**
- **Overall materiality** — judgment based on benchmark and percentage (commonly 5% of PBT, 0.5-1% of revenue, 1-2% of equity, 1-2% of total assets, depending on user emphasis)
- **Performance materiality** — typically 50-75% of overall materiality
- **Specific materiality** — for particular classes of transactions / accounts / disclosures requiring lower threshold (e.g., related parties, executive compensation)
- **Clearly trivial threshold** — typically 5% of performance materiality

### Phase 4 — Fieldwork / procedures (ISA 330, 500, 501-540)

**[T1] Audit evidence** must be sufficient (quantity) and appropriate (relevance + reliability). Per assertion (existence, completeness, valuation, rights/obligations, classification, presentation/disclosure, accuracy, cut-off), select procedures from:

| Procedure | Type |
|---|---|
| Inspection of records or documents | Substantive / control |
| Inspection of tangible assets | Substantive (existence) |
| Observation | Control |
| Inquiry of management / others | Substantive / control / inquiry |
| External confirmation | Substantive (existence/valuation) |
| Recalculation | Substantive |
| Reperformance | Control |
| Analytical procedures | Substantive (when designed appropriately) |

**[T1]** Specific ISA-required procedures:
- ISA 240 — fraud: testing journal entries, related party transactions, management override
- ISA 250 — laws and regulations: inquiries, document inspection, legal letters
- ISA 501 — inventory observation, litigation legal letters, segment information
- ISA 540 (Revised) — accounting estimates (including ECL, pensions, goodwill, fair value)
- ISA 550 — related party transactions
- ISA 560 — subsequent events review through report date
- ISA 570 — going concern (12 months from balance sheet date in most jurisdictions; 12 from report sign-off in some)
- ISA 600 — group audits and component auditor reliance

### Phase 5 — Completion (ISA 700-720)

**[T1] Completion checklist:**
- Going concern assessment (ISA 570)
- Subsequent events review (ISA 560)
- Written representations from management (ISA 580)
- Quality control review (ISA 220, 220R)
- Engagement Quality Review (EQR) for PIE / listed audits (ISA 220R, ISQM 1)
- Key Audit Matters (KAM) selection (ISA 701 — listed entities) / equivalent for unlisted in some jurisdictions
- Audit opinion formulation (ISA 700, 705, 706)
- Annual report or other information reading (ISA 720)

### Phase 6 — Reporting (ISA 700/705/706/701/710)

**[T1]** Opinion options:
- **Unmodified** — financial statements give a true and fair view
- **Qualified** — material but not pervasive misstatement OR scope limitation
- **Adverse** — material and pervasive misstatement
- **Disclaimer** — material and pervasive scope limitation
- **Emphasis of matter** — adds emphasis without modifying opinion (e.g., subsequent event after issuance)
- **Other matter** — additional matters not addressed in financial statements
- **Key Audit Matters** — significant matters in current period audit (listed and certain unlisted)
- **Going concern paragraph** — material uncertainty paragraph or going concern KAM

### Phase 7 — Post-issuance (ISA 220R, ISQM 1)

**[T1]**
- Engagement quality reviews
- Firm monitoring and remediation
- Inspections by regulators (PCAOB, FRC, AOB, etc.)
- Subsequent discovery of facts (ISA 560 ¶14-17)
