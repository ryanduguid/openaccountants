# Foundation Workflow Bases

Tier-1 workflow architectures. Every domain has a base that explains *how* the work is done. Country-specific content skills load on top and provide the *what* (rates, thresholds, forms).

## Tax domain bases

## How to use

You generally don't load these directly — they're loaded automatically by the country / state content skills that depend on them. If you're building a new country skill, load the relevant workflow base first; it gives you the contract every country skill must fulfill.

See [docs/skill-template.md](../../docs/skill-template.md) for the slot contract that every content skill must populate.
