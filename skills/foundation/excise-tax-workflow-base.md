description: >
  Tier 1 workflow base for excise duty skills covering harmonised excise on energy products, alcohol, and tobacco (EU Directives 2003/96/EC, 92/83/EEC, 2011/64/EU) and non-harmonised excise (sugar, plastics, single-use plastic, gambling, environmental). Workflow architecture only — no country rate tables or product-specific guidance. MUST be loaded alongside a country excise content skill. Assumes a licensed excise warehouse keeper or authorised consignor / consignee operates under bond and EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System). Does NOT cover: customs duty (see customs-duties-workflow-base), VAT on excise products (see country VAT skills), excise on cannabis where legalised (specialist), or licensing process for excise warehouse.

# Excise Tax Workflow Base v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

Tier 1 workflow base for excise duty skills. Country content skills load on top.

## Section 1 — Scope and assumptions

Excise duty is a tax on the production or sale of specific goods, typically:
- Energy products (motor fuel, heating fuel, gas, coal, electricity)
- Alcoholic beverages
- Tobacco products
- Sugar-sweetened beverages (UK, Norway, Hungary, others)
- Plastic / single-use plastic packaging
- Gambling
- Vehicle registration / luxury vehicle (some countries)

This workflow base assumes:
- The taxpayer is a producer, importer, distributor, or retailer of excisable goods
- Excisable goods are stored under bond in authorised warehouses until release for consumption
- The country has implemented EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System) or equivalent (EU) — or the US bonded warehouse / Form 5000 series equivalent

---

## Section 2 — Lifecycle runbook

### Step 1 — Determine excisable status

**[T1]** For each product:
- Is it listed in the country's excise legislation?
- What is the applicable rate / tariff classification?
- Are there reduced rates (e.g., red diesel, agricultural fuel)?
- Are there exemptions (e.g., scientific use, denatured alcohol)?

### Step 2 — Determine the chargeable event

**[T1]** Excise becomes due on the **release for consumption** — typically:
- Departure from a tax warehouse (other than under duty-suspension arrangement)
- Manufacture outside a tax warehouse
- Importation outside a duty-suspension arrangement
- Holding outside a duty-suspension arrangement
- Irregularity during a duty-suspended movement (deemed release)

### Step 3 — Compute the duty

**[T1]** Depending on product type:
- **Specific duty** — per litre, per kg, per pack, per stick
- **Ad valorem** — % of retail price (typical for tobacco)
- **Combined** — both (e.g., EU tobacco minimum specific + ad valorem)

For alcohol: typically per hectolitre of pure alcohol (ethanol) for spirits; per hectolitre and degree of strength for beer/wine/intermediate products. Reduced rates for small breweries, small wine producers, low-alcohol products.

### Step 4 — Apply duty-suspension and movements

**[T1] EU EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System):**
- Electronic Administrative Document (eAD) accompanies suspended movements
- Authorised Warehouse Keeper / Registered Consignor / Registered Consignee status required
- Closure of movement upon arrival at destination triggers chargeable event in destination MS (if released) or duty suspension continues
- Movement guarantee covers the duty during transit

### Step 5 — Pay the duty

**[T1]** Periodic excise return — typically monthly. Payment generally within 1 month of the chargeable event. Bond / guarantee covers deferred payment.

### Step 6 — Track exemptions and reliefs

**[T1] Common exemptions:**
- Diplomatic / consular use
- Visiting forces (NATO SOFA)
- Research / scientific use
- Denatured alcohol
- Domestic production for personal use (limited)
- Renewable energy / biofuels (variable)
- Industrial use (e.g., energy products for non-fuel use)

## Section 3 — EU harmonised excise framework

### 3.1 Energy products (Directive 2003/96/EC)

**[T1] Minimum rates:**
- Unleaded petrol: EUR 359 per 1,000L
- Diesel (commercial use): EUR 330 per 1,000L
- Heating gas oil: EUR 21 per 1,000L
- Heavy fuel oil: EUR 15 per 1,000kg
- LPG (heating): EUR 0 per 1,000kg
- Natural gas (heating): EUR 0.15/0.30 per GJ (commercial / non-commercial)
- Coal and coke: EUR 0.15/0.30 per GJ
- Electricity: EUR 0.50/1.00 per MWh

Member States set rates above these minima; some derogations / reduced rates approved by Council.

### 3.2 Alcohol (Directives 92/83/EEC and 92/84/EEC)

**[T1] Minimum rates:**
- Beer: EUR 1.87 per hectolitre / degree Plato OR EUR 0.748 per hectolitre / degree of alcohol (chosen MS basis)
- Wine (still and sparkling): EUR 0 (minimum) — many MS set zero
- Intermediate products (sherry, port, fortified): EUR 45 per hectolitre
- Spirits: EUR 550 per hectolitre of pure alcohol

Reduced rates available for small independent breweries (typically up to 50% reduction).

### 3.3 Tobacco (Directive 2011/64/EU)

**[T1] Minimum excise duty:**
- **Cigarettes**: at least 60% of weighted average retail selling price (WARSP); minimum EUR 90 per 1,000 cigarettes (or 115% of weighted average retail selling price)
- **Fine-cut tobacco**: 48% of weighted average retail selling price; minimum EUR 60 per kg
- **Cigars / cigarillos**: 5% of weighted average retail selling price OR EUR 12 per 1,000 / EUR 12 per kg
- **Other smoking tobacco**: 20% of weighted average retail selling price OR EUR 22 per kg

Combination of specific and ad valorem; minimum total varies.

### 3.4 EMCS data flow

| Stage | Document |
|---|---|
| Dispatch | e-AD (electronic Administrative Document) with Administrative Reference Code (ARC) |
| In transit | ARC referenced on transport documents |
| Receipt at destination | Report of Receipt (RoR) by consignee |
| Closure | EMCS auto-closes upon successful RoR |
| Discrepancy / shortage | Excise becomes chargeable in destination MS |
