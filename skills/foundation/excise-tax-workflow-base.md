description: Tier 1 workflow base for excise duty skills covering harmonised excise on energy products, alcohol, and tobacco (EU Directives 2003/96/EC, 92/83/EEC, 2011/64/EU) and non-harmonised excise (sugar, plastics, single-use plastic, gambling, environmental). Workflow architecture only — no country rate tables or product-specific guidance. MUST be loaded alongside a country excise content skill. Assumes a licensed excise warehouse keeper or authorised consignor / consignee operates under bond and EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System). Does NOT cover: customs duty (see customs-duties-workflow-base), VAT on excise products (see country VAT skills), excise on cannabis where legalised (specialist), or licensing process for excise warehouse.

# Excise Tax Workflow Base

## What this file is

Tier 1 workflow base for excise duty skills. Country content skills load on top.

## Section 1 — Scope and assumptions

Excise duty is a tax on the production or sale of specific goods, typically:
- Energy products (motor fuel, heating fuel, gas, coal, electricity)
- Alcoholic beverages
- Tobacco products
- Sugar-sweetened beverages (UK, Norway, Hungary, others)
- Plastic / single-use plastic packaging
- Gambling
- Vehicle registration / luxury vehicle (some countries)

This workflow base assumes:
- The taxpayer is a producer, importer, distributor, or retailer of excisable goods
- Excisable goods are stored under bond in authorised warehouses until release for consumption
- The country has implemented EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System) or equivalent (EU) — or the US bonded warehouse / Form 5000 series equivalent

## Section 2 — Lifecycle runbook

### Step 1 — Determine excisable status

- **Determine excisable status** — For each product: Is it listed in the country's excise legislation? What is the applicable rate / tariff classification? Are there reduced rates (e.g., red diesel, agricultural fuel)? Are there exemptions (e.g., scientific use, denatured alcohol)? ([T1])  _([T1])_

### Step 2 — Determine the chargeable event

- **Chargeable event = release for consumption** — Excise becomes due on the release for consumption — typically: Departure from a tax warehouse (other than under duty-suspension arrangement); Manufacture outside a tax warehouse; Importation outside a duty-suspension arrangement; Holding outside a duty-suspension arrangement; Irregularity during a duty-suspended movement (deemed release) ([T1])  _([T1])_

### Step 3 — Compute the duty

- **Duty computation methods** — Depending on product type: Specific duty — per litre, per kg, per pack, per stick; Ad valorem — % of retail price (typical for tobacco); Combined — both (e.g., EU tobacco minimum specific + ad valorem). For alcohol: typically per hectolitre of pure alcohol (ethanol) for spirits; per hectolitre and degree of strength for beer/wine/intermediate products. Reduced rates for small breweries, small wine producers, low-alcohol products. ([T1])  _([T1])_

### Step 4 — Apply duty-suspension and movements

- **EU EMCS duty-suspension movement rules** — EU EMCS (Excise Movement and Control System): Electronic Administrative Document (eAD) accompanies suspended movements; Authorised Warehouse Keeper / Registered Consignor / Registered Consignee status required; Closure of movement upon arrival at destination triggers chargeable event in destination MS (if released) or duty suspension continues; Movement guarantee covers the duty during transit ([T1])  _([T1])_

### Step 5 — Pay the duty

- **Periodic excise return and payment** — Periodic excise return — typically monthly. Payment generally within 1 month of the chargeable event. Bond / guarantee covers deferred payment. ([T1])  _([T1])_

### Step 6 — Track exemptions and reliefs

- **Common exemptions** — Common exemptions: Diplomatic / consular use; Visiting forces (NATO SOFA); Research / scientific use; Denatured alcohol; Domestic production for personal use (limited); Renewable energy / biofuels (variable); Industrial use (e.g., energy products for non-fuel use) ([T1])  _([T1])_
