name: customs-duties-workflow-base
description: >
  Tier 1 workflow base for customs duty skills. Covers the customs declaration lifecycle from origin determination, HS classification, valuation, preference, special procedures, through to release for free circulation. Workflow architecture only — no country-specific tariff rates or detailed special procedure mechanics. MUST be loaded alongside a country/region customs content skill (EU UCC, US CBP, UK CDS post-Brexit, etc.). Assumes a licensed customs broker, AEO/CTPAT certified party, or in-house customs manager files the declaration. Does NOT cover: CBAM (see cbam-carbon-border-adjustment), import VAT (see country VAT skills), excise duties (see excise-tax-workflow-base), or anti-dumping / countervailing duty investigation procedure (only their tariff effect at point of declaration).

# Customs and Duties Workflow Base v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

The Tier 1 workflow base for customs duty skills. Country content skills load on top.

---

## Section 1 — Audience and assumptions

This base assumes:

- The **declarant** is an importer / exporter / customs representative
- The **shipment** has been physically moved or is being placed under a customs procedure
- A **licensed customs broker** or in-house customs manager files the declaration
- The HS Code is determined under the WCO Harmonized System and applied at the national tariff level

---

## Section 2 — Lifecycle runbook

### Step 1 — Document the transaction

- Commercial invoice (supplier, buyer, consignee)
- Packing list
- Bill of lading / airway bill / CMR
- Certificate of origin (preferential or non-preferential)
- Transport documents
- Sanitary / phytosanitary / safety certificates
- Licenses (dual-use, controlled goods)
- CBAM-relevant emissions data (EU imports of in-scope goods)

### Step 2 — Determine HS classification

**[T1]** Use WCO Harmonized System nomenclature at the level required by the destination country:
- 6 digits — WCO common level
- 8 digits — typical national tariff (e.g., EU Combined Nomenclature)
- 10 digits — TARIC or US HTS additional precision

Apply the General Rules for the Interpretation (GRI 1-6) of the HS:
1. Headings and chapter notes
2. Incomplete / unassembled goods classify as complete
3. Mixed goods classify by essential character or last-in-numerical-order
4. Goods most akin
5. Containers / packaging
6. Comparable level subheadings

### Step 3 — Determine origin

**[T1]** Two origin types:

- **Non-preferential origin** — country where last substantial transformation occurred; used for trade statistics, anti-dumping, trade remedy, marking, quota
- **Preferential origin** — origin granting reduced or zero duty under a free trade agreement (FTA), generalised scheme of preferences (GSP), customs union

**[T1] Preferential origin tests:**
- Wholly obtained (mining, agriculture, fishing)
- Sufficient transformation per the FTA's specific rules (change in tariff heading, value-added percentage, specific manufacturing operation)
- Cumulation (bilateral / diagonal / full / regional)
- Direct transport / non-manipulation

### Step 4 — Determine customs value

**[T1] WTO Customs Valuation Agreement** — six methods in hierarchical order:

1. **Transaction value of the imported goods** (the price actually paid or payable) — primary method
2. **Transaction value of identical goods** — already accepted by customs
3. **Transaction value of similar goods**
4. **Deductive value** (resale price method)
5. **Computed value** (cost-plus method)
6. **Fallback / reasonable means consistent with WTO**

**[T1] Adjustments to transaction value (Article 8 WTO Valuation Agreement):**

| Add | Subtract |
|---|---|
| Commissions / brokerage paid to buyer's agent | Buying commissions |
| Container costs | Charges for construction / assembly / maintenance after importation |
| Packing | Duties and taxes payable in destination |
| Assists (free or below-cost goods/services provided by buyer to seller) | Interest paid (if separately identified) |
| Royalties / license fees related to imported goods that buyer must pay as condition of sale | |
| Resale proceeds accruing to seller | |
| Transport, loading, handling, insurance to the place of importation | |

### Step 5 — Apply tariff

**[T1]**
- Base most-favoured-nation (MFN) rate per WTO commitments
- Preferential rate where origin satisfied and certificate / declaration provided
- Anti-dumping / countervailing duty if applicable
- Tariff suspensions (autonomous suspensions, EU)
- Tariff quotas (in-quota / out-of-quota duty rates)
- Safeguard measures
- Retaliatory duties (Section 301 US; EU retaliation lists)

### Step 6 — Apply special procedures (where applicable)

- **Inward processing** — duty-free import for processing and re-export
- **Outward processing** — re-import after processing abroad with duty only on added value
- **Customs warehousing** — duty deferral
- **Free zones / FTZ** — duty-free storage and processing
- **Temporary admission / ATA Carnet** — duty-free import for exhibitions, samples, professional equipment
- **End-use** — reduced duty for specific use
- **Transit** (T1 / T2 / TIR) — movement under customs control

### Step 7 — Prepare and lodge declaration

- Customs declaration in destination country's electronic system (EU AES/IES, US ACE, UK CDS, China MIPS, India ICES, etc.)
- Single Administrative Document (SAD) for EU; entry summary for US ABI
- Pre-arrival lodgement where required (24-hour rule for ocean to US, EU ICS2)

### Step 8 — Pay duty and VAT/GST

- Duty paid on release OR deferred under deferment account (with bank guarantee)
- Import VAT/GST — paid at import OR self-assessed under postponed VAT accounting (EU PVA), reverse charge

### Step 9 — Post-clearance audit and amendment

**[T1]** Customs authorities have 3-5 years post-clearance to audit. Maintain documentation. Voluntary amendment (corrective declaration) reduces penalties.
