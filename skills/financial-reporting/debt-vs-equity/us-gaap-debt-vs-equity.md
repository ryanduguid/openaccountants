# US GAAP Debt vs. Equity — ASC 480 / 470-20 / 815-40 / 505 v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This is a content skill that loads on top of `financial-reporting-workflow-base`.** It supplies the classification, measurement, presentation, and disclosure rules for issued financial instruments under US GAAP — distinguishing liabilities from equity, identifying temporary (mezzanine) equity, and accounting for convertible debt. The base supplies the two-layer output contract, the journal-entry format, and the self-checks.

**Standard currency.** ASC 480, ASC 815-40, and ASC 505 as effective, and ASC 470-20 **as amended by ASU 2020-06** (*Debt — Debt with Conversion and Other Options; Derivatives and Hedging — Contracts in Entity's Own Equity*), effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after 15 December 2021 and for all other entities after 15 December 2023. ASU 2020-06 **eliminated** the cash-conversion and most beneficial-conversion-feature (BCF) separation models.

**Scope.** This skill addresses the **issuer's** classification of instruments it has issued. It does not cover the holder's classification, embedded-derivative measurement methodology beyond bifurcation triggers, EPS computation, or share-based payment (ASC 718).

---

## Section 1 — Scope statement

This skill covers, from the **issuer's** perspective:

- The three classes of freestanding instruments classified as **liabilities (or assets)** under `ASC 480`.
- Convertible debt under `ASC 470-20` after **ASU 2020-06** (single-liability default; the limited remaining separation cases).
- Contracts in the entity's **own equity** under `ASC 815-40`: the indexed-to-own-stock assessment and the equity-classification conditions.
- **Temporary (mezzanine) equity** for SEC registrants under `ASC 480-10-S99-3A`.
- Treasury stock and the classification of dividends/distributions (`ASC 505-30`, `505-10`).

This skill does NOT cover: share-based payment (`ASC 718`), EPS (`ASC 260`), embedded-derivative valuation methodology, or the holder's accounting. It defers the IFRS treatment to `ias32-debt-vs-equity`.

## Section 2 — Reference layer (Layer A): the classification rules

### The order of analysis

For a **freestanding** financial instrument, US GAAP applies a sequence: **(1)** Is it within the scope of and classified as a **liability** under ASC 480? If not, **(2)** for SEC registrants, is it **redeemable** such that it must sit in **temporary equity** (`ASC 480-10-S99-3A`)? **(3)** For contracts in own equity, does it meet the **ASC 815-40** indexation and equity-classification conditions, or is it a derivative/liability? Convertible **debt** runs through **ASC 470-20** (post-ASU 2020-06) with an ASC 815-15 embedded-derivative screen.

### ASC 480 — three classes classified as liabilities — `ASC 480-10-25`

A **freestanding** financial instrument is classified as a **liability** (or in some cases an asset) if it falls into any of three classes:

**Class 1 — Mandatorily redeemable financial instruments** (`ASC 480-10-25-4`). An instrument embodying an **unconditional obligation** requiring the issuer to **redeem it by transferring assets** at a specified or determinable date or on an event **certain to occur** (e.g. mandatorily redeemable preferred stock). Liability classification applies even though the instrument is legally equity.

**Class 2 — Obligations to repurchase the issuer's equity shares by transferring assets** (`ASC 480-10-25-8`). Instruments that embody an obligation (other than only on liquidation/termination) to repurchase the issuer's own shares, or that are indexed to such an obligation, **and** that **may require** settlement by transferring assets — e.g. a **written put option** or a **forward purchase contract** on the issuer's own shares.

**Class 3 — Certain obligations settleable in a variable number of shares** (`ASC 480-10-25-14`). Instruments embodying an unconditional obligation, or a financial instrument other than an outstanding share that may require settlement by issuing a **variable number of shares**, where the monetary value of the obligation at inception is based **predominantly** on **any one** of:
- a **fixed monetary amount** known at inception (e.g. a note settleable in $1m of shares);
- **variations in something other than** the issuer's own share price (e.g. a commodity price or an index); or
- variations **inversely related** to the issuer's share price (e.g. a written put settled in shares).

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — mandatorily redeemable preferred is a liability, "dividends" are interest.** A preferred share that **must** be redeemed for cash on a fixed date is an `ASC 480-10-25-4` **liability**; its "dividends" are recognised in **interest expense**, not as an equity distribution. Misclassifying it as equity overstates equity and understates expense. (Note: ASC 480 defers liability classification for certain **mandatorily redeemable** instruments of **non-SEC-registrant** entities and for those redeemable only on liquidation — `ASC 480-10-65` / `25-4` scope nuances. Document the scope conclusion.)

### ASC 470-20 — convertible debt after ASU 2020-06 — `ASC 470-20-25`

**The default is now a single liability.** ASU 2020-06 **eliminated** the **cash-conversion** model and most of the **beneficial-conversion-feature (BCF)** model. For most convertible debt instruments the issuer records the **entire proceeds as a debt liability** with **no separation of an equity component** (`ASC 470-20-25` as amended). The conversion feature is **not** bifurcated into equity.

**Separation is required only in narrow cases:**

- **Substantial premium** — if convertible debt is issued at a **substantial premium**, the premium may be attributable to the conversion feature and recorded in **paid-in capital** (`ASC 470-20-25-13`).
- **Embedded derivative requiring bifurcation** — if the conversion feature (or another embedded feature) meets the `ASC 815-15-25` criteria for separation from the debt host (not clearly-and-closely related, would be a derivative standalone, and does **not** qualify for the own-equity scope exception in `ASC 815-10-15-74(a)`/`ASC 815-40`), bifurcate it as an **embedded derivative liability** measured at fair value, with changes in P&L.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — single-liability default is the headline divergence from IFRS.** Post-ASU 2020-06, a plain convertible bond is **one liability at full proceeds with no equity component** under US GAAP, whereas **IAS 32 always splits** it into liability + equity. For an identical bond, reported equity, leverage, and the interest-expense profile differ between frameworks. Confirm no embedded-derivative bifurcation or substantial-premium fact pattern overrides the single-liability default.

### ASC 815-40 — contracts in the entity's own equity — `ASC 815-40-15` and `-25`

A contract on the issuer's own stock (e.g. warrants, written options, forward sale of shares, the conversion feature screened above) avoids derivative/liability treatment — i.e. qualifies for **equity classification** — only if it passes **two gates**:

1. **Indexed to the entity's own stock** (`ASC 815-40-15-5` to `15-8`). A two-step test: **(Step 1)** evaluate the contract's **exercise contingencies** (must not be based on an observable market/index other than those referenced to the issuer's own operations or stock); **(Step 2)** evaluate the **settlement provisions** — the settlement amount must equal the difference between the fair value of a fixed number of shares and a fixed monetary amount (a "fixed-for-fixed" analogue, but **not identical** to IAS 32). A notable allowance: a strike price **denominated in a currency other than** the issuer's functional currency does **not** by itself preclude indexation under US GAAP (`ASC 815-40-15-7I`) — an **FX exception that differs from IFRS**.
2. **Equity classification conditions** (`ASC 815-40-25-1` to `25-43`): settlement in **unregistered shares is permitted**, the entity has **sufficient authorised and unissued shares**, there is an **explicit share cap**, **no required cash payment** if the entity fails to timely file, no cash-settled top-off/make-whole, and the contract ranks no higher than other equity in a bankruptcy — among others. Failing any condition → **asset/liability (derivative)**, remeasured through earnings.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — share-settled vs. cash-settled, and the FX exception.** Whether a warrant is equity or a fair-valued liability hinges on the `ASC 815-40-25` conditions; a single failing condition (e.g. a net-cash-settlement provision on a failed registration) makes the whole instrument a **liability remeasured through earnings**, injecting P&L volatility. The functional-currency-strike conclusion can differ from IFRS's fixed-for-fixed — flag for dual-reporters.

### ASC 480-10-S99-3A — temporary (mezzanine) equity — SEC registrants

For **SEC registrants**, an equity-classified instrument (most commonly **redeemable preferred stock** or **redeemable non-controlling interest**) that is **redeemable**:

- at a **fixed or determinable price** on a fixed or determinable date,
- at the **option of the holder**, or
- upon an event **not solely within the control of the issuer**,

and that is **not** already a liability under ASC 480, must be presented in **"temporary equity"** — a **mezzanine** section **between liabilities and permanent equity** on the balance sheet. Subsequent measurement follows one of two methods (accrete to the redemption amount over the period to the earliest redemption date, or recognise changes immediately) per `ASC 480-10-S99-3A`.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — temporary equity has no IFRS equivalent.** A redeemable preferred whose redemption is outside the issuer's control sits in **mezzanine equity** under SEC US GAAP, but is generally a **financial liability** under IAS 32. This is a structural balance-sheet difference, not a measurement nuance. Confirm registrant status and the "outside the issuer's control" assessment.

### Treasury stock and distributions — `ASC 505-30`, `505-10`

Reacquired own shares (**treasury stock**) are recorded as a **reduction of equity** (cost or par-value method, `ASC 505-30`); **no gain or loss** in earnings on reacquisition/reissuance — differences go to **paid-in capital / retained earnings**. Dividends declared on **equity-classified** stock reduce **retained earnings**; "dividends" on **liability-classified** instruments are **interest expense**.

---

## Section 3 — Reference layer: high-frequency special topics

- **Freestanding vs. embedded** (`ASC 480-10-25` scope; `ASC 815-15`): ASC 480 applies to **freestanding** instruments; conversion and similar features inside a host contract are **embedded** and screened under ASC 815-15 for bifurcation. Getting this scoping wrong is the most common error.
- **Order of consolidation/sequencing** (`ASC 815-40-25`): when an entity has multiple contracts competing for the same authorised shares, evaluate sequencing to determine whether enough shares remain for equity classification.
- **Down-round features** (`ASU 2017-11`): a down-round feature no longer precludes equity classification of an otherwise-equity instrument; its effect is recognised as a deemed dividend when triggered (interaction with EPS).
- **Convertible debt issuance costs** (post-ASU 2020-06): allocated entirely to the **single debt liability** and amortised as part of the effective interest rate (no allocation to an equity component, because there generally is none).
- **Induced conversions / extinguishments** (`ASC 470-20-40`): conversions induced by sweetened terms, and repurchases, follow the extinguishment/induced-conversion guidance.

---

## Section 4 — Executable layer (Layer B): the procedure

Run these steps on the instrument's facts. Each cites the Layer A rule it executes.

1. **Determine freestanding vs. embedded** (`ASC 480-10` scope / `ASC 815-15`). Freestanding → continue with ASC 480; embedded feature → screen under ASC 815-15.
2. **Run the ASC 480 three-class test** (`480-10-25-4`, `-8`, `-14`): mandatorily redeemable? obligation to repurchase own shares by transferring assets? variable-share obligation based predominantly on a fixed amount / non-share variable / inverse to share price? Any → **liability**.
3. **If convertible debt** (`ASC 470-20`): default to a **single liability at full proceeds**; check for a **substantial premium** (`25-13`) or an **embedded derivative** needing bifurcation (`ASC 815-15-25`).
4. **For contracts on own equity** (`ASC 815-40`): apply the **indexed-to-own-stock** two-step test (`15-5` to `15-8`, incl. the FX allowance) and the **equity-classification conditions** (`25-1` to `25-43`). Pass both → equity; fail → derivative/liability remeasured through earnings.
5. **For SEC registrants**, screen equity instruments for **temporary equity** (`480-10-S99-3A`); set up accretion to the redemption amount if applicable.
6. **Book the journal entries** (base §3 format) at initial recognition and over subsequent periods (effective-interest accretion, fair-value remeasurement of any liability-classified contract, mezzanine accretion).
7. **Classify distributions**: interest expense (liability) vs. dividend to retained earnings (equity); deemed dividend for any down-round trigger.
8. **Produce the disclosure checklist** (§6) and **reviewer brief** with every flash point.

### Worked example (illustrative) — convertible bond, US GAAP single liability

**Facts.** Same as the IFRS edition for direct comparison: on 1 Jan 20X1 a non-SEC-or-SEC entity issues a **$1,000,000** par, **3-year**, **5%** annual-coupon **convertible bond** at par, convertible into a fixed number of the issuer's shares. The market rate for similar non-convertible debt is **8%**. Assume the conversion feature does **not** require bifurcation (it meets the ASC 815-40 own-equity scope exception) and there is **no substantial premium**.

**Analysis.** Under **ASU 2020-06** the cash-conversion separation model is eliminated; with no bifurcated derivative and no substantial premium, the **entire $1,000,000 proceeds** are recorded as a **single debt liability** with **no equity component** (`ASC 470-20-25`). Because the bond was issued **at par**, there is **no discount/premium** to amortise and the coupon rate equals the carrying yield — the 8% market rate for "similar non-convertible debt" is **not** used to split the instrument (contrast IFRS, which uses 8% to carve out an equity component).

```
1 Jan 20X1 — issue of convertible bond, single liability — driving rule: ASC 470-20-25 (post-ASU 2020-06)
  Dr  Cash                                       1,000,000
      Cr  Convertible debt (liability)                 1,000,000
  (memo: full proceeds to a single liability; NO equity conversion component
   recognised. Debits = credits ✓)

31 Dec 20X1 — coupon paid (issued at par, no discount) — driving rule: ASC 835-30 effective interest
  Dr  Interest expense (P&L)                         50,000
      Cr  Cash                                              50,000
  (memo: 5% coupon = carrying yield because issued at par; no amortisation.
   Repeats end 20X2 and 20X3. Debits = credits ✓)

31 Dec 20X3 — conversion at maturity (assume all converted) — driving rule: ASC 470-20-40 (book-value method)
  Dr  Convertible debt (liability)               1,000,000
      Cr  Common stock / additional paid-in capital     1,000,000
  (memo: carrying amount of the debt reclassified to equity on conversion; no
   gain or loss under the book-value method. Debits = credits ✓)
```

**Contrast with IFRS (see `ias32-debt-vs-equity` §4).** For the **identical** bond, IAS 32 splits the proceeds into a **$922,687 liability** (PV at 8%) and a **$77,313 equity** conversion option, then accretes the liability to par at an **8% effective rate** (interest expense $73,815 / $75,720 / $77,778 vs. US GAAP's flat $50,000). Same cash flows, **materially different equity, leverage, and interest expense**.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — confirm no bifurcation / no substantial premium before defaulting to single liability.** The single-liability answer holds **only** if the conversion (and any other embedded) feature is **not** a bifurcated derivative and the bond is **not** issued at a substantial premium. If the conversion feature failed the ASC 815-40 own-equity scope exception (e.g. a net-cash-settlement or insufficient-shares problem), it would be a **fair-valued embedded derivative** with earnings volatility — a completely different P&L.

---

## Section 5 — Presentation

- **ASC 480 liabilities** are presented within **liabilities**, even where the instrument is legally equity (e.g. mandatorily redeemable preferred).
- **Temporary (mezzanine) equity** is presented **between liabilities and permanent equity** on an SEC registrant's balance sheet, captioned separately (`ASC 480-10-S99-3A`).
- **Equity-classified contracts** (qualifying warrants, conversion features where separated as a substantial premium) sit in **permanent equity / additional paid-in capital**.
- **Treasury stock** reduces equity (`ASC 505-30`); no earnings gain/loss on reacquisition or reissuance.
- **Distributions**: interest expense for liability-classified instruments; dividends to retained earnings for equity; deemed dividend on a triggered down-round feature.

---

## Section 6 — Divergence from IFRS (IAS 32 / IFRS 9)

This is the section a dual-reporter scrutinises most. For an identical instrument the two frameworks frequently reach **different** classifications and amounts.

| Area | US GAAP (ASC 480/470-20/815-40) | IFRS (IAS 32) |
|------|----------------------------------|---------------|
| **Convertible bonds** | Post-**ASU 2020-06**, generally **a single liability** at full proceeds — no equity component (BCF/cash-conversion separation **eliminated**); split only for a substantial premium or a bifurcated embedded derivative | **Split** into liability (PV at market rate) + equity (residual) — **always** for a conventional convertible (`IAS 32.28`–`32`) |
| **Mezzanine / temporary equity** | **Temporary equity** between liabilities and permanent equity for SEC registrants (`ASC 480-10-S99-3A`) — redeemable preferred, redeemable NCI | **No such category** — typically a **financial liability** under IAS 32 |
| **Own-equity contracts** | **Indexed-to-own-stock** test (`ASC 815-40-15`) with an explicit **FX exception** (non-functional-currency strike does not preclude indexation, `15-7I`) | **Fixed-for-fixed** test (`IAS 32.16(b)`); a non-functional-currency settlement amount generally **fails** fixed-for-fixed |
| **Puttable instruments** | **No equity exception** — generally a liability or, for SEC filers, temporary equity | **Equity by exception** if `IAS 32.16A`–`16D` conditions met |
| **Mandatorily redeemable instruments** | **Liability** (`ASC 480-10-25-4`), with deferrals/scope nuances for non-SEC entities and liquidation-only redemption | **Liability** (`IAS 32.18(a)`), with its own scope nuances |
| **"Dividends" on liability-classified preferred** | Charged to income (interest); EPS/presentation mechanics differ | **Interest expense** in P&L (`IAS 32.40`) |

Run `ias32-debt-vs-equity` in parallel for dual-reporters and present both answers (base §2).

## Section 9 — Disclaimer

Provides computational and interpretive guidance on ASC 480 / 470-20 / 815-40 / 505 only. Not an audit and not assurance. Classifying instruments as liabilities, equity, or temporary equity turns heavily on the specific contractual terms, registrant status, and significant judgement. Have outputs reviewed and signed by a qualified accountant before they are reflected in financial statements relied upon by third parties.
