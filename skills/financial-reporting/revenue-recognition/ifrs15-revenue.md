  IFRS revenue recognition under IFRS 15 (Revenue from Contracts with Customers)
  and the related contract-cost guidance within IFRS 15. Covers the five-step
  model — identify the contract, identify performance obligations, determine the
  transaction price, allocate it, and recognise revenue as or when obligations are
  satisfied — plus variable consideration and the constraint, significant
  financing components, principal-versus-agent, licences, contract modifications,
  contract assets and liabilities, and the costs of obtaining and fulfilling a
  contract. Produces recognition conclusions, journal entries, and a reviewer
  brief. Issued as the IFRS edition of the revenue topic; see
  us-gaap-asc606-revenue for the US GAAP edition. MUST load alongside

# IFRS Revenue — IFRS 15 v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is

**This is a content skill that loads on top of `financial-reporting-workflow-base`.** It supplies the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure rules for revenue from contracts with customers under IFRS. The base supplies the two-layer output contract, the journal-entry format, and the self-checks.

**Standard currency.** IFRS 15 as effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, including *Clarifications to IFRS 15* (April 2016). No subsequent amendment has displaced the five-step core.

**Scope.** IFRS 15 applies to contracts with customers except: leases (IFRS 16), insurance contracts (IFRS 17), financial instruments and other contractual rights/obligations in IFRS 9 / IFRS 10 / IFRS 11 / IAS 27 / IAS 28, and certain non-monetary exchanges between entities in the same line of business to facilitate sales to customers (`IFRS 15.5`).

---

## Section 1 — Scope statement

This skill covers:

- The five-step model of IFRS 15.
- Variable consideration and the constraint; significant financing components; non-cash consideration; consideration payable to a customer.
- Principal vs. agent, licences of IP, warranties, customer options (material rights), bill-and-hold, repurchase agreements, consignment.
- Contract modifications.
- Presentation of contract assets, contract liabilities, and refund liabilities.
- Incremental costs of obtaining a contract and costs to fulfil (`IFRS 15.91`–`104`).

This skill does NOT cover: lease income (`IFRS 16`), interest/dividend income (`IFRS 9`/`IAS 18`-legacy superseded), insurance (`IFRS 17`). It defers the US GAAP treatment to `us-gaap-asc606-revenue`.

---

## Section 2 — Reference layer (Layer A): the five-step model

### Step 1 — Identify the contract — `IFRS 15.9`–`16`

A contract with a customer is in scope when **all five** criteria are met (`15.9`):

1. The parties have **approved** the contract and are committed to perform.
2. Each party's **rights** are identifiable.
3. **Payment terms** are identifiable.
4. The contract has **commercial substance**.
5. It is **probable** the entity will collect the consideration it is entitled to. Under IFRS, **"probable" = more likely than not** — a **lower** threshold than US GAAP's "likely."

If criteria are not met, consideration received is recognised as a **liability** until the criteria are met or the `15.15` release events occur.

**Combine contracts** with the same customer (or related parties) entered into at/near the same time when negotiated as a package, consideration is interdependent, or the goods/services form a single performance obligation (`15.17`).

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — collectibility threshold differs from US GAAP.** The IFRS bar to *have a contract* is lower. A US-GAAP-trained reviewer may wrongly defer revenue. Document the "more likely than not" assessment.

### Step 2 — Identify the performance obligations — `IFRS 15.22`–`30`

A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a **distinct** good/service or a **series** of distinct goods/services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer (`15.22`).

Distinct requires **both** (`15.27`):
- **Capable of being distinct** — the customer can benefit from it on its own or with readily available resources; and
- **Distinct within the context of the contract** — separately identifiable; the entity is not providing a significant integration service, the good does not significantly customise/modify another, and it is not highly interdependent/interrelated (`15.29`).

### Step 3 — Determine the transaction price — `IFRS 15.46`–`72`

Transaction price = consideration the entity expects to be **entitled to**, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties.

- **Variable consideration** (`15.50`–`54`): estimate using **expected value** or **most likely amount**.
- **The constraint** (`15.56`–`58`): include only to the extent **highly probable** that a significant reversal will not occur. *(IFRS uses "highly probable"; US GAAP uses "probable" — wording differs, intended threshold is the same.)*
- **Significant financing component** (`15.60`–`65`): adjust for time value of money where significant. Practical expedient: ignore if ≤ 1 year between transfer and payment (`15.63`).
- **Non-cash consideration** (`15.66`–`69`): measure at **fair value**; if fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, measure by reference to the standalone selling price.
- **Consideration payable to a customer** (`15.70`–`72`): reduction of transaction price unless for a distinct good/service.

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — non-cash consideration measurement date.** IFRS measures non-cash consideration at fair value (with a fallback to SSP) and the measurement-date approach can differ from ASC 606's "contract inception" rule. Flag for dual-reporters.

### Step 4 — Allocate the transaction price — `IFRS 15.73`–`90`

Allocate to each PO by **standalone selling price** (`15.76`); estimate SSP where not observable (adjusted market assessment, expected cost plus margin, or residual approach with the `15.79` restrictions). Allocate discounts (`15.81`–`83`) and variable consideration (`15.84`–`86`) to specific POs where the criteria are met.

### Step 5 — Recognise revenue when/as a PO is satisfied — `IFRS 15.31`–`45`

Recognise revenue when the entity transfers **control** of the good/service (`15.31`).

**Over time** if **any one** of three criteria is met (`15.35`):
1. The customer **simultaneously receives and consumes** benefits as the entity performs; or
2. Performance **creates or enhances an asset the customer controls**; or
3. Performance does **not create an asset with alternative use** and the entity has an **enforceable right to payment** for performance to date.

If over time, **measure progress** by output or input method (`15.39`–`45`); if progress cannot be reasonably measured but costs are recoverable, recognise revenue only to the extent of costs (`15.45`).

**Point in time** otherwise — recognise when control transfers, using indicators in `15.38` (present right to payment, legal title, physical possession, risks and rewards, acceptance).

---

## Section 3 — Reference layer: high-frequency special topics

- **Principal vs. agent** (`IFRS 15.B34`–`B38`): principal **controls** the good/service before transfer → **gross**; agent → **net** (fee/commission). Same indicators as US GAAP.
- **Licences of IP** (`IFRS 15.B52`–`B63`): **right to access** (IP changes over the period) → **over time**; **right to use** (IP as it exists when granted) → **point in time**. Sales/usage-based **royalty exception** (`15.B63`): recognise at the later of the subsequent sale/usage or satisfaction of the PO.
- **Warranties** (`15.B28`–`B33`): assurance-type → provision under `IAS 37`, not a PO; service-type → separate PO.
- **Customer options / material rights** (`15.B39`–`B43`): a material right is a separate PO.
- **Contract modifications** (`IFRS 15.18`–`21`): separate contract if distinct goods at SSP; otherwise prospective (if remaining goods distinct) or cumulative catch-up (if not).

---

## Section 4 — Reference layer: contract costs — `IFRS 15.91`–`104`

- **Incremental costs of obtaining** a contract are recognised as an **asset** if expected to be recovered (`15.91`). Practical expedient: expense if amortisation period ≤ 1 year (`15.94`).
- **Costs to fulfil** a contract (not in another standard) are capitalised if they relate directly to a contract, generate/enhance resources, and are expected to be recovered (`15.95`).
- **Amortise** consistent with transfer of goods/services; test for impairment (`15.99`–`104`).

---

## Section 5 — Presentation — `IFRS 15.105`–`109`

- **Contract liability**: consideration received/due before transfer of goods/services.
- **Contract asset**: right to consideration for goods/services transferred, conditional on something other than the passage of time. Once unconditional → **receivable** (in scope of `IFRS 9` for impairment).
- **Refund liability** plus an **asset for the right to recover** returned goods.

---

## Section 6 — Executable layer (Layer B): the procedure

Identical procedure to the US GAAP edition (base §1, two layers), citing IFRS 15 paragraphs:

1. **Confirm a contract exists** (`15.9`); if collectibility (more-likely-than-not) fails, book a liability and stop.
2. **List promises → POs** (`15.22`–`30`); document distinct analysis; flag series, material rights, warranties.
3. **Build the transaction price** (`15.46`–`72`): fixed + constrained variable; significant financing component; non-cash at fair value; net consideration payable.
4. **Determine SSP and allocate** (`15.73`–`90`); show the table.
5. **Timing per PO** (`15.31`–`45`): over time (criterion + progress measure) or point in time (control indicators).
6. **Principal/agent** for third-party promises (`B34`–`B38`) → gross/net.
7. **Recognise revenue**; book **journal entries** (base §3) day 1 + subsequent.
8. **Capitalise/amortise contract costs** (`15.91`–`104`).
9. **Classify balances** (`15.105`–`109`).
10. **Disclosure checklist** (§8) + **reviewer brief** with every flash point.

### Worked example (illustrative)

Same SaaS facts as the US GAAP edition ($24,000 subscription + $6,000 non-distinct setup, paid upfront, 24-month delivery). Single combined PO, over time under `15.35(a)`, straight-line.

```
Day 1 — driving rule: IFRS 15.106 (contract liability)
  Dr  Cash                                   30,000
      Cr  Contract liability                       30,000
  (memo: single combined PO; no revenue at inception)

Each month (×24) — driving rule: IFRS 15.35(a)
  Dr  Contract liability                       1,250
      Cr  Revenue                                    1,250
  (memo: 30,000 / 24; debits = credits ✓)

Day 1 — incremental cost to obtain — driving rule: IFRS 15.91
  Dr  Contract cost asset                      3,000
      Cr  Cash                                       3,000

Each month (×24) — amortise — driving rule: IFRS 15.99
  Dr  Amortisation expense                       125
      Cr  Contract cost asset                          125
```

> **⚑ AUDIT FLASH POINT — same combine/separate judgement as US GAAP.** The distinct conclusion drives timing identically; evidence the integration analysis.

## Section 7 — Divergence from US GAAP (ASC 606)

| Area | IFRS 15 | US GAAP (ASC 606) |
|------|---------|-------------------|
| Collectibility threshold (Step 1) | "Probable" = **more likely than not** (lower bar) | "Probable" = **likely** (higher bar) |
| Constraint wording | "Highly probable" | "Probable" (same intended threshold) |
| Shipping & handling | **No** policy election — assess as promised service | Policy election to treat as fulfillment activity |
| Immaterial promised goods/services | No explicit relief; general materiality | Explicit relief to disregard (`606-10-25-16A`) |
| Non-cash consideration | Fair value, fallback to SSP; measurement-date guidance differs | Fair value at contract inception |
| Licensing renewals & sales-based royalties | Minor application differences | Minor application differences |
| Interim disclosures | IAS 34 | US public-entity interim regime |
| Reversal of impairment of contract cost assets | **Permitted** (consistent with IFRS) | **Prohibited** (US GAAP generally bars reversal) |

Run `us-gaap-asc606-revenue` in parallel for dual-reporters and present both answers (base §2).

## Section 10 — Disclaimer

Provides computational and interpretive guidance on IFRS 15 only. Not an audit and not assurance. Revenue recognition turns heavily on entity-specific facts and significant judgement. Have outputs reviewed and signed by a qualified accountant before they are reflected in financial statements relied upon by third parties.
