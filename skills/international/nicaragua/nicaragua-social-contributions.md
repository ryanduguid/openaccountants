**Contribution overview (Régimen Integral, standard formal employment):**

| Party | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (Laboral) | 7.00% | Withheld from gross salary; no ceiling |
| Employer (Patronal), ≤50 employees | 21.50% | Plus 2.00% INATEC = 23.50% total burden |
| Employer (Patronal), >50 employees | 22.50% | Plus 2.00% INATEC = 24.50% total burden |
| State | 1.75% | Enfermedad y Maternidad — funded by the State, not the employer |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown contribution regime | Assume **Régimen Integral** (standard for formal employees) |
| Unknown employer size (≤50 vs >50) | Assume **≤50 employees** (lower 21.50% employer rate); flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether income is Nicaraguan-source | STOP — territorial system means source must be confirmed before taxing |
| Unknown residence/domicile of payee | Ask — non-residents face 20% definitive WHT, not the progressive schedule |
| Unknown whether INSS debit is contribution or penalty | Classify as contribution; flag for reviewer |
| Unknown gross vs net salary | Ask — INSS is computed on **gross**; do not infer from net |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- gross monthly salary (in córdobas) and contribution regime (Integral vs IVM-RP). Without gross salary, STOP. Do not compute INSS or IR.

**Recommended** -- employer headcount (≤50 vs >50, determines employer INSS rate), residence/domicile of the employee, and whether the individual has more than one employer.

**Ideal** -- INSS planilla (payroll schedule), DGI IR-122 monthly remittances, prior-year IR-106 (if filed), and bank statements showing INSS/INATEC/DGI debits.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-NI-SOC-1 -- Gross salary unknown.** *Trigger:* gross monthly salary not provided. *Message:* "Gross salary is mandatory. INSS contributions and IR withholding are both computed on gross salary, with no maximum insurable ceiling (Decreto 06-2019). Cannot proceed without the gross figure."

**R-NI-SOC-2 -- Penalty / surcharge quantification.** *Trigger:* client asks to quantify late-filing or late-payment penalties (multa, recargo por mora, mantenimiento de valor). *Message:* "Exact penalty, surcharge and value-maintenance (mantenimiento de valor) amounts under the Código Tributario (Ley No. 562) could not be confirmed from an authoritative source. Do not estimate. Escalate to a licensed Nicaraguan accountant. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]"

**R-NI-SOC-3 -- Non-Nicaraguan-source income.** *Trigger:* income may be foreign-source. *Message:* "Nicaragua uses a territorial system — only Nicaraguan-source income is taxed (LCT). Source determination requires case-specific analysis. Escalate to a licensed accountant before computing IR."

**R-NI-SOC-4 -- Special regimes / Free Trade Zone.** *Trigger:* client operates under Zona Franca, mining, fishing, or other special regime. *Message:* "Special regimes (Zona Franca / Free Trade Zone, mining, fishing) have distinct INSS and minimum-wage treatment. Escalate to a licensed Nicaraguan accountant."

**R-NI-SOC-5 -- INSS sub-component precision.** *Trigger:* client needs the exact IVM / Salud / Riesgos Profesionales / Víctimas de Guerra split rather than the headline total. *Message:* "PwC confirms only the headline totals (7.00% employee; 21.50% / 22.50% employer). The sub-component split is taken from a Nicaraguan tax-reference source consistent with Decreto 06-2019 but not from inss.gob.ni directly. Flag for reviewer if component-level precision is required. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm components]"

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for Nicaraguan bank statement transactions related to social security and payroll tax. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. INSS, INATEC and DGI remittances EXCLUDE from any VAT (IVA) return or revenue classification — they are statutory contributions/withholdings, not business supplies. Spanish-language references are common; both Spanish and English forms are listed.

### 3.1 INSS contributions (employee withholding + employer share)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INSS, INSTITUTO NICARAGUENSE DE SEGURIDAD SOCIAL | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Monthly remittance of employee + employer INSS |
| SEGURIDAD SOCIAL, SEG SOCIAL | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Same |
| APORTE PATRONAL, CUOTA PATRONAL | EXCLUDE -- employer INSS share | Employer 21.50% / 22.50% |
| APORTE LABORAL, CUOTA LABORAL | EXCLUDE -- employee INSS withholding | Employee 7.00% |
| SIE INSS, PLANILLA INSS | EXCLUDE -- INSS payroll remittance | INSS payment via planilla |

### 3.2 INATEC training levy

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INATEC, TECNOLOGICO NACIONAL | EXCLUDE -- INATEC 2% levy | Employer training levy, collected via INSS |
| APORTE INATEC, CAPACITACION 2% | EXCLUDE -- INATEC levy | 2.00% of gross payroll |

### 3.3 DGI income-tax remittances (NOT INSS -- do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DGI, DIRECCION GENERAL DE INGRESOS | EXCLUDE -- income tax remittance | IR, not social security |
| IR-122, RETENCION IR, RETENCIONES | EXCLUDE -- IR withholding remittance | Monthly employer withholding (Form IR-122) |
| IR-106, RENTA ANUAL | EXCLUDE -- annual income-tax return payment | Form IR-106 |
| RENTAS DEL TRABAJO | EXCLUDE -- employment-income IR | Not INSS |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARIO, NOMINA, PLANILLA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Gross wage payment, not a contribution |
| PAGO SALARIO, ABONO NOMINA (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not a contribution |

### 3.5 INSS benefits received (not contributions)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION INSS, JUBILACION | EXCLUDE -- pension income received | Not a contribution paid |
| SUBSIDIO INSS, SUBSIDIO MATERNIDAD | EXCLUDE -- benefit received | Sickness/maternity subsidy, not a contribution |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement / payroll classifications for a hypothetical formal employer and employee in Nicaragua (Régimen Integral unless stated). All amounts in córdobas (C$). All arithmetic uses the rates in Section 5.

### Example 1 -- Employee INSS withholding on a C$30,000 monthly salary

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; INSS APORTE LABORAL ; DEBITO ; PLANILLA MARZO 2025 ; -2,100.00 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "INSS ... APORTE LABORAL" (pattern 3.1). Employee INSS = 7.00% × C$30,000 gross = **C$2,100.00**. No ceiling applies (Decreto 06-2019). This is the employee withholding portion only; the employer share is separate.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Employee INSS withholding = C$2,100.00.

### Example 2 -- Employer INSS share (≤50 employees) on the same salary

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; INSS APORTE PATRONAL ; DEBITO ; PLANILLA MARZO 2025 ; -6,450.00 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "INSS ... APORTE PATRONAL" (pattern 3.1). Employer with ≤50 employees pays 21.50% × C$30,000 = **C$6,450.00**. (For an employer with >50 employees it would be 22.50% × C$30,000 = C$6,750.00.)

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Employer INSS share = C$6,450.00 (≤50-employee rate).

### Example 3 -- INATEC training levy

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; INATEC CAPACITACION 2% ; DEBITO ; NOMINA MARZO 2025 ; -600.00 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "INATEC" (pattern 3.2). INATEC = 2.00% × C$30,000 gross payroll = **C$600.00**, collected via INSS infrastructure on behalf of INATEC.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. INATEC employer levy = C$600.00.

### Example 4 -- Monthly IR withholding remittance to DGI (Form IR-122)

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; DGI RETENCION IR-122 ; DEBITO ; RENTAS DEL TRABAJO MAR 2025 ; -3,496.67 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "DGI ... IR-122" (pattern 3.3) — income tax, NOT INSS. Computation for a C$30,000/month employee in the Régimen Integral:
- Monthly gross: C$30,000; employee INSS (deductible): 7% = C$2,100.
- Monthly taxable base after INSS: C$30,000 − C$2,100 = C$27,900.
- Annualised taxable income: C$27,900 × 12 = C$334,800 (falls in the 200,000.01–350,000 bracket).
- Annual IR = base C$15,000 + 20% × (C$334,800 − C$200,000) = C$15,000 + C$26,960 = **C$41,960.00/year**.
- Monthly withholding = C$41,960 / 12 = **C$3,496.67**.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. IR (rentas del trabajo) withholding, not INSS. Remitted on Form IR-122.

### Example 5 -- Exempt-band employee (no IR withholding)

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; INSS APORTE LABORAL ; DEBITO ; PLANILLA MARZO 2025 ; -560.00 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches pattern 3.1. Employee earns C$8,000/month gross. Employee INSS = 7% × C$8,000 = **C$560.00**. Annualised taxable base after INSS = (8,000 − 560) × 12 = C$89,280, which is below the C$100,000 exempt band (LCT Art. 23). **No IR withholding is due** — there would be no corresponding DGI IR-122 debit for this employee.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Employee INSS = C$560.00; IR = nil (below exempt band).

### Example 6 -- Non-resident definitive withholding (NOT progressive)

**Input line:**
`12.05.2025 ; DGI RETENCION NO RESIDENTE ; DEBITO ; PAGO SERVICIOS ; -10,000.00 ; NIO`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "DGI RETENCION" (pattern 3.3). Payment of C$50,000 of Nicaraguan-source income to a non-resident. Non-residents face a **20% definitive WHT** (PwC), not the progressive schedule: 20% × C$50,000 = **C$10,000.00**. The progressive brackets do NOT apply to non-residents.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. 20% non-resident definitive WHT = C$10,000.00. Confirm Nicaraguan source before applying.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when bank statement data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 -- INSS is computed on GROSS salary, no ceiling

INSS contributions apply to the full gross salary. There is **no maximum insurable salary** ("sin techo") since Decreto 06-2019. Never cap the base.

### Rule 2 -- Régimen Integral rates (standard formal employment)

| Component | Employee | Employer ≤50 | Employer >50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| IVM (pension) | 4.75% | 12.50% | 13.50% |
| Enfermedad y Maternidad (health) | 2.25% | 6.00% | 6.00% |
| Riesgos Profesionales | — | 1.50% | 1.50% |
| Víctimas de Guerra | — | 1.50% | 1.50% |
| **Total** | **7.00%** | **21.50%** | **22.50%** |

Source: PwC (headline totals 7.00% / 21.50% / 22.50%); component split per nicatributos.com consistent with Decreto 06-2019. [RESEARCH GAP — component split not confirmed on inss.gob.ni directly.] The State separately funds 1.75% (Enfermedad y Maternidad).

### Rule 3 -- Régimen IVM-RP rates (pension + occupational risk only, no health)

| Party | Total | Components |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 5.00% | IVM 4.75% + Víctimas de Guerra 0.25% |
| Employer ≤50 | 15.50% | — |
| Employer >50 | 16.50% | — |

Source: nicatributos.com (consistent with Decreto 06-2019). Use only when the IVM-RP regime is explicitly confirmed; otherwise default to Régimen Integral.

### Rule 4 -- INATEC training levy

INATEC = **2.00% of total gross payroll**, paid by the employer, mandatory for all employers, collected monthly through INSS on behalf of INATEC (Ley Orgánica del INATEC). It is an employer cost separate from INSS.

### Rule 5 -- Total employer payroll burden (Integral)

- ≤50 employees: 21.50% INSS + 2.00% INATEC = **23.50%** of gross payroll.
- \>50 employees: 22.50% INSS + 2.00% INATEC = **24.50%** of gross payroll.

This is on top of the 7.00% employee INSS withholding (which is borne by the employee, not the employer).

### Rule 6 -- IR (employment income) progressive schedule

Income tax on rentas del trabajo (LCT Art. 23). System is **territorial** — only Nicaraguan-source income.

| Annual taxable income (C$) | Base tax (C$) | Marginal % on excess over lower bound |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 100,000 | 0 | 0% (exempt) |
| 100,000.01 – 200,000 | 0 | 15% |
| 200,000.01 – 350,000 | 15,000 | 20% |
| 350,000.01 – 500,000 | 45,000 | 25% |
| 500,000.01 and above | 82,500 | 30% |

Cumulative-tax check: 100,000×15% = 15,000 → base for next band. 15,000 + 150,000×20% = 15,000 + 30,000 = 45,000 → base for next. 45,000 + 150,000×25% = 45,000 + 37,500 = 82,500 → base for top band. Source: PwC; LCT Art. 23 as reformed by Ley No. 891.

### Rule 7 -- IR taxable base is gross less employee INSS

Employee INSS (7.00% under the Integral regime) is deductible in arriving at the IR taxable base for employment income. Compute IR on (annual gross − annual employee INSS).

### Rule 8 -- Non-residents: 20% definitive WHT

Nicaraguan-source income paid to non-residents (whether domiciled or not) is subject to a **20% definitive withholding tax** (PwC). The progressive schedule does not apply.

### Rule 9 -- Monthly remittance deadline (Form IR-122)

Employers withhold and remit employment-income IR monthly via **Form IR-122**, due no later than the **5th day of the following month** (DGI FAQ).

### Rule 10 -- Annual individual return (Form IR-106)

Annual individual return is **Form IR-106**, due **within 90 days after year-end** (~31 March). Final tax payment also due within 90 days after year-end (PwC).

### Rule 11 -- Single-employer filing exemption

An individual with a **single employer** and no other qualifying income/deductions is generally **not** required to file an annual return — the employer's monthly withholding is final. An annual return is required where aggregate income from **multiple employers** exceeds **C$100,000** (PwC / DGI FAQ).

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When bank statement data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these situations for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- Employer size at the ≤50 / >50 boundary

**Trigger:** Employer headcount is near 50, or fluctuates month to month.

**Issue:** The employer INSS rate (21.50% vs 22.50%) and IVM-RP rate (15.50% vs 16.50%) depend on whether the employer has ≤50 or >50 employees. The exact counting basis at the boundary is not clear from secondary sources.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Default to ≤50 (lower rate) only as a stated assumption.

### T2-2 -- Regime classification (Integral vs IVM-RP)

**Trigger:** It is unclear whether an employee falls under Régimen Integral or Régimen IVM-RP.

**Issue:** IVM-RP (no health component) applies to specific cases only. Misclassifying changes both employee (7.00% vs 5.00%) and employer rates.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Default to Régimen Integral.

### T2-3 -- Multiple employers and annual return obligation

**Trigger:** Individual has income from more than one employer in the year.

**Issue:** Aggregate income from multiple employers exceeding C$100,000 triggers an annual IR-106 filing obligation; withholding by each employer may not equal the correct annual tax.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Recommend an annual reconciliation on Form IR-106.

### T2-4 -- Source of income (territorial system)

**Trigger:** Income may be partly foreign-source, or paid from/to abroad.

**Issue:** Nicaragua taxes only Nicaraguan-source income. Source characterisation is fact-specific.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Do not tax foreign-source income without confirmation.

### T2-5 -- Penalties, surcharges and mantenimiento de valor

**Trigger:** Client has late INSS, INATEC, or IR filings/payments.

**Issue:** Late filing/payment under the Código Tributario (Ley No. 562) triggers multas, recargo por mora, interest, and mantenimiento de valor (indexation). The exact percentages and unit amounts could **not** be confirmed from an authoritative source (DGI penalties page was blocked).

**Action:** Do NOT quantify. Escalate to a licensed accountant. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against Ley No. 562 / DGI.]

### T2-6 -- Special regimes (Zona Franca, mining, fishing)

**Trigger:** Employer operates in a Free Trade Zone or other special sector.

**Issue:** These sectors have distinct INSS, minimum-wage, and (for Zona Franca) income-tax treatment.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Do not apply standard rates without confirmation.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How contributions and remittances appear on Nicaraguan bank statements

Statements are typically in Spanish and in córdobas (NIO / C$). Common banks: BANPRO, BAC, LAFISE (Banco LAFISE Bancentro), FICOHSA, Banco de Finanzas (BDF).

**INSS remittances:**
- Description: "INSS", "INSTITUTO NICARAGUENSE DE SEGURIDAD SOCIAL", "APORTE PATRONAL", "APORTE LABORAL", "PLANILLA INSS"
- Timing: Monthly, typically early in the month following the payroll month
- Amount: Employee 7.00% and employer 21.50%/22.50% may appear as one combined remittance or split lines

**INATEC levy:**
- Description: "INATEC", "TECNOLOGICO NACIONAL", "CAPACITACION 2%"
- Timing: Monthly, collected via INSS
- Amount: 2.00% of gross payroll

**DGI income-tax remittances:**
- Description: "DGI", "DIRECCION GENERAL DE INGRESOS", "RETENCION IR", "IR-122"
- Timing: Monthly, due by the 5th of the following month
- Amount: aggregate IR withheld from employees

**Key identification tips:**
1. INSS/INATEC/DGI debits are always outgoing (DEBITO), never credits.
2. INSS recurs monthly; the employer share is roughly 3x the employee share under the Integral regime (21.50% vs 7.00%).
3. INATEC is small and consistent (2.00% of gross payroll).
4. Do NOT confuse DGI (income tax, IR-122) debits with INSS (social security) debits — different authorities, different obligations.
5. Inbound INSS credits (PENSION INSS, SUBSIDIO) are benefits received, not contributions.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for INSS / INATEC / DGI debits** — identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns.
2. **Separate the three streams** — INSS (social security), INATEC (2% levy), and DGI (income tax, IR-122).
3. **Reverse-engineer gross payroll where possible:**
   - Employer INSS debit / 0.215 ≈ gross payroll (≤50 employees), or / 0.225 (>50 employees).
   - INATEC debit / 0.02 ≈ gross payroll (cross-check against the INSS-derived figure).
   - Employee INSS debit / 0.07 ≈ gross payroll (Integral regime).
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank statement amounts only. Contribution regime, employer headcount, and income source have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing."

Note: 2025 rates remain in force into 2026 for most sectors as MITRAB had not set 2026–2027 rates (except Free Trade Zone) as of March 2026. [RESEARCH GAP — 2026–2027 sectoral minimum wages not yet published.]

### Filing & remittance deadlines

| Obligation | Form | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly IR withholding | IR-122 | 5th of following month | DGI FAQ |
| Annual individual return | IR-106 | Within 90 days of year-end (~31 Mar) | PwC |
| INSS / INATEC monthly remittance | INSS planilla | Monthly (via INSS) | INSS / Ley Orgánica del INATEC |

### Registration

- Employers must register with **INSS** and enrol employees; contributions remitted monthly through INSS (which also collects the 2% INATEC levy).
- Employers register with **DGI** as withholding agents (responsable retenedor) for IR.
- Registration is **obligation-based** (employing staff / carrying on economic activity), not turnover-threshold based. [RESEARCH GAP — no córdoba registration threshold found in an authoritative source; reviewer to confirm.]

### Penalties

- Late filing/payment under the Código Tributario (Ley No. 562) triggers multas, recargo por mora, interest, and mantenimiento de valor (indexation). **Exact percentages and unit amounts could not be confirmed** — the DGI penalties page was blocked. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against Ley No. 562 / DGI.]

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Régimen Integral, gross C$30,000/month. -> Employee INSS = 7% × 30,000 = **C$2,100.00**.

**Test 2:** Régimen Integral, gross C$30,000/month, ≤50 employees. -> Employer INSS = 21.50% × 30,000 = **C$6,450.00**.

**Test 3:** Régimen Integral, gross C$30,000/month, >50 employees. -> Employer INSS = 22.50% × 30,000 = **C$6,750.00**.

**Test 4:** Gross monthly payroll C$30,000. -> INATEC = 2.00% × 30,000 = **C$600.00**. Total employer burden (≤50) = 6,450 + 600 = **C$7,050.00** (23.50%).

**Test 5:** Gross C$30,000/month, Integral. Annual taxable base = (30,000 − 2,100) × 12 = C$334,800 (20% bracket). -> Annual IR = 15,000 + 20% × (334,800 − 200,000) = 15,000 + 26,960 = **C$41,960.00**; monthly withholding = **C$3,496.67**.

**Test 6:** Gross C$8,000/month, Integral. Annual taxable base = (8,000 − 560) × 12 = C$89,280 (below C$100,000 exempt band). -> IR = **nil**.

**Test 7:** Non-resident paid C$50,000 of Nicaraguan-source income. -> 20% definitive WHT = **C$10,000.00**. Progressive schedule does NOT apply.

**Test 8:** Régimen IVM-RP, gross C$20,000/month. -> Employee = 5.00% × 20,000 = **C$1,000.00**; employer (≤50) = 15.50% × 20,000 = **C$3,100.00**.

**Test 9:** Annual taxable income exactly C$500,000. -> IR = 45,000 + 25% × (500,000 − 350,000) = 45,000 + 37,500 = **C$82,500.00** (confirms the top-band base tax).

**Test 10:** Annual taxable income C$700,000. -> IR = 82,500 + 30% × (700,000 − 500,000) = 82,500 + 60,000 = **C$142,500.00**.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER cap the INSS base — there is no maximum insurable salary ("sin techo") since Decreto 06-2019.
- NEVER compute INSS or IR on net salary — both use GROSS salary (less employee INSS for the IR base only).
- NEVER apply the progressive IR schedule to a non-resident — non-residents pay 20% definitive WHT.
- NEVER tax foreign-source income — Nicaragua is territorial; confirm source first.
- NEVER quantify penalties, surcharges, or mantenimiento de valor — the figures are unconfirmed; escalate.
- NEVER present the INSS sub-component split (IVM/Salud/RP/Guerra) as authoritative — only the 7.00% / 21.50% / 22.50% totals are PwC-confirmed.
- NEVER confuse DGI (income tax, IR-122) debits with INSS (social security) debits — separate authorities.
- NEVER assume employer size — the ≤50 vs >50 rate difference is material; confirm or flag.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — label as estimated and direct the client to their INSS planilla and DGI account.
- NEVER skip reviewer escalation on special regimes (Zona Franca, mining, fishing).
