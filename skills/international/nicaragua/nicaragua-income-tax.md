  Use this skill whenever asked about Nicaragua income tax (Impuesto sobre la Renta, IR) on employment income — rentas del trabajo. Trigger on phrases like "how much tax do I pay in Nicaragua", "Impuesto sobre la Renta", "IR rentas del trabajo", "retención IR", "IR-122", "IR-106", "annual income tax return Nicaragua", "INSS laboral", "córdoba tax", "DGI", "payroll income tax Nicaragua", "exempt threshold C$100,000", or any question about computing or filing income tax on salary for a Nicaraguan resident employee. Also trigger when preparing or reviewing monthly IR withholding, annualizing a salary to the progressive scale, computing the deductible 7% INSS laboral before IR, or advising on the annual IR-106 filing obligation. This skill covers the progressive employment-income scale (exempt up to C$100,000/yr, then 15/20/25/30%), the deductibility of INSS laboral, monthly withholding via IR-122, the annual IR-106 return, non-resident definitive withholding, and the interaction with INSS. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Nicaragua income-tax work.

### Progressive Annual Scale — Rentas del Trabajo (2025)

**Legislation:** LCT (Ley 822) Art. 23, as reformed by Ley 891. Amounts in córdobas (C$). The scale applies to **annual taxable employment income** (gross salary less the employee's 7% INSS laboral).

| Annual taxable income (C$) | Base tax (C$) | % on excess over lower bound | Lower bound (C$) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.01 -- 100,000.00 | 0.00 | 0% (exempt) | 0.00 |
| 100,000.01 -- 200,000.00 | 0.00 | 15% | 100,000.00 |
| 200,000.01 -- 350,000.00 | 15,000.00 | 20% | 200,000.00 |
| 350,000.01 -- 500,000.00 | 45,000.00 | 25% | 350,000.00 |
| 500,000.01 and above | 82,500.00 | 30% | 500,000.00 |

**Base-tax column reconciliation (to the cent):**
- At C$200,000.00 → 15% × (200,000.00 − 100,000.00) = **C$15,000.00**
- At C$350,000.00 → 15,000.00 + 20% × (350,000.00 − 200,000.00) = 15,000.00 + 30,000.00 = **C$45,000.00**
- At C$500,000.00 → 45,000.00 + 25% × (500,000.00 − 350,000.00) = 45,000.00 + 37,500.00 = **C$82,500.00**

Each base-tax figure equals the cumulative tax at the top of the band below it. The column is internally consistent.

**Exempt threshold:** the first **C$100,000.00 per year** (≈ **C$8,333.33 per month**) is exempt. IR withholding applies only to taxable income above this amount.

**Tax formula for taxable income T (C$):**
```
IR_annual = base_tax(band) + rate(band) × (T − lower_bound(band))
```

### Non-Residents

Non-residents are taxed by **20% definitive withholding (retención definitiva)** on Nicaraguan-source income — a **flat** rate, NOT the progressive scale. This is final; no annual return reconciliation applies for the withheld amount. **[RESEARCH GAP: confirm any treaty overrides for specific counterparties before applying.]**

### INSS and INATEC Rates (2025)

| Contribution | Payer | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| INSS laboral (régimen Integral) | Employee | 7.00% | Whole gross salary, **no upper cap** |
| INSS patronal — employers with ≤50 employees | Employer | 21.50% | Whole gross salary, no cap |
| INSS patronal — employers with >50 employees | Employer | 22.50% | Whole gross salary, no cap |
| INATEC (training levy) | Employer | 2.00% | Gross salary (on top of INSS) |

**Salary ceiling eliminated:** the maximum insurable-earnings ceiling was removed by INSS Resolution **RI-112-2018**. Contributions are calculated on the **entire gross salary with NO upper cap**. The employee rate rose from 6.25% to **7.00%** effective **15 Feb 2019**. Do NOT use the stale ceiling of C$130,362.60/month or the pre-2019 6.25% rate — they are outdated.

### Order of Computation (critical)

IR on employment income is computed on income **net of the employee's 7% INSS laboral**. INSS laboral is a deduction from gross **before** the progressive scale is applied.

```
Annual taxable income = Annual gross salary − Annual INSS laboral (7% of gross)
Annual IR             = scale applied to annual taxable income
```

**[RESEARCH GAP: confirm the exact ordering and any further allowable deductions against LCT Art. 19–23 / DGI guidance before signing off a return.]**

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Residence status unknown | STOP — do not pick progressive vs 20% definitive WHT without residence |
| Currency not stated | Assume córdoba (C$ / NIO); do not assume USD |
| Income source (employment vs business) | Treat as rentas del trabajo only; refuse other income classes |
| Whether INSS already deducted | Assume gross (INSS not yet deducted); deduct 7% before the scale |
| Multiple employers in the year | Flag IR-106 annual-return obligation (see Section 5) |
| Monthly vs annual figures | Confirm; annualize (×12) before applying the annual scale |
| Any deduction beyond INSS laboral | Not allowed without explicit DGI basis |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — annual (or monthly, clearly labelled) **gross salary in córdobas**, confirmation of **residence status** (resident vs non-resident), and confirmation that the income is **employment income (rentas del trabajo)**.

**Recommended** — payslips or a payroll summary (colilla de pago) for the full year, the employer's INSS laboral deduction records, number of employers during the year, and any prior-year IR-106 or DGI assessment.

**Ideal** — full payroll ledger (nómina), INSS contribution receipts, employer remittance records (IR-122 filings), and confirmation of whether the employee has more than one employer.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No salary figure at all = hard stop. Salary without payslips = proceed with reviewer warning: "This IR computation was produced from a stated salary figure alone. The reviewer must verify gross salary, the 7% INSS laboral deduction, residence status, and whether an annual IR-106 return is required (more than one employer)."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-NI-1 — Residence status unknown.** "Residence determines whether the progressive rentas-del-trabajo scale or the 20% definitive non-resident withholding applies. This skill cannot compute IR without confirmed residence status. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-NI-2 — Business / professional income (rentas de actividades económicas).** "This skill covers employment income (rentas del trabajo) only. IR on business and professional activity (rentas de actividades económicas) uses a different regime and rates. Escalate to a Nicaraguan licensed accountant (CCPN)."

**R-NI-3 — Capital income (rentas de capital y ganancias de capital).** "Income from capital and capital gains is taxed under a separate IR cédula (typically definitive withholding). Out of scope. Escalate to a Nicaraguan licensed accountant."

**R-NI-4 — Non-resident beyond simple WHT.** "Non-resident situations involving treaty relief, permanent establishments, or mixed-source income require specialised analysis. This skill applies only the flat 20% definitive WHT to clearly Nicaraguan-source employment income of a non-resident. Escalate otherwise."

**R-NI-5 — Arrears / DGI enforcement.** "Client has outstanding IR arrears or is subject to DGI enforcement. Surcharges and interest (recargos) apply. Do not advise. Escalate to a Nicaraguan licensed accountant immediately."

**R-NI-6 — IVA / VAT requested.** "This skill covers income tax (IR rentas del trabajo) only. For Nicaragua IVA, use the nicaragua-iva skill."

**R-NI-7 — Payroll / INSS-employer computation requested.** "For full payroll processing, INSS patronal, and INATEC employer contributions, use the nicaragua-payroll skill. This skill computes the employee's IR and 7% INSS laboral only."

## Section 3 -- Transaction / Payslip Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for payroll and payslip (colilla de pago) lines. When a line matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the line label as it appears on the payslip or payroll ledger. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. All amounts are córdobas (C$).

### 3.1 Income / Earnings Lines (add to gross)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARIO, SUELDO, SALARIO BASE, SUELDO BÁSICO | Gross employment income | Add to annual gross |
| HORAS EXTRA, OVERTIME | Gross employment income | Taxable employment income |
| COMISIÓN, COMISIONES, BONO, BONIFICACIÓN | Gross employment income | Taxable; part of rentas del trabajo |
| INCENTIVO, GRATIFICACIÓN | Gross employment income | Taxable unless a specific exemption is documented |
| AGUINALDO, DÉCIMO TERCER MES (13th-month) | Gross employment income — EXEMPT subject to limit | 13th-month pay (aguinaldo) is exempt up to the legal amount. **[RESEARCH GAP: confirm exemption ceiling against LCT before excluding.]** |
| VIÁTICOS (genuine business reimbursement) | EXCLUDE | Reimbursed business expense, not income, if genuine and documented |
| INDEMNIZACIÓN (statutory severance) | EXEMPT subject to limit | Statutory severance exempt up to legal limit. **[RESEARCH GAP: confirm ceiling.]** |

### 3.2 Deduction Lines (subtract before the IR scale)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INSS, INSS LABORAL, SEGURO SOCIAL (7%) | DEDUCT before IR scale | 7% of gross; reduces taxable income. Deduct from gross to get IR base |

### 3.3 Withholding / Tax Lines (NOT a deduction from the IR base)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RETENCIÓN IR, IR RETENIDO, IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA | IR withheld | This is the tax itself — a credit against the annual IR liability, not a deductible expense |

### 3.4 Lines That Are NEITHER Income Nor a Pre-IR Deduction

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INATEC | EXCLUDE (employer cost) | Employer-paid 2% levy; not an employee deduction, not employee income |
| INSS PATRONAL | EXCLUDE (employer cost) | Employer 21.5%/22.5%; out of scope for employee IR |
| ANTICIPO, PRÉSTAMO, ADELANTO (salary advance) | EXCLUDE | Advance / loan against salary — not income, not a deduction |
| EMBARGO, RETENCIÓN JUDICIAL | EXCLUDE from IR base | Court-ordered garnishment; does not reduce taxable income |

### 3.5 Non-Resident Line

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Non-resident Nicaraguan-source employment payment | 20% definitive WHT | Flat 20% on the gross Nicaraguan-source amount; do NOT apply the progressive scale |

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in córdobas (C$). Every total reconciles to the cent.

### Example 1 -- Monthly salary below the exempt threshold

**Input:** Resident employee, gross salary **C$8,000.00 / month** (C$96,000.00 / year).

**Reasoning:**
- Annual gross = 8,000.00 × 12 = C$96,000.00.
- INSS laboral = 7% × 96,000.00 = C$6,720.00.
- Annual taxable income = 96,000.00 − 6,720.00 = **C$89,280.00**.
- C$89,280.00 ≤ C$100,000.00 → falls in the 0% exempt band.

**Classification:** Annual IR = **C$0.00**. No monthly IR withholding. INSS laboral of C$560.00/month (6,720.00 / 12) is still deducted and remitted.

### Example 2 -- Salary in the 15% band

**Input:** Resident employee, gross salary **C$20,000.00 / month** (C$240,000.00 / year).

**Reasoning:**
- Annual gross = 20,000.00 × 12 = C$240,000.00.
- INSS laboral = 7% × 240,000.00 = C$16,800.00.
- Annual taxable income = 240,000.00 − 16,800.00 = **C$223,200.00**.
- C$223,200.00 falls in the **200,000.01 – 350,000.00** band (base C$15,000.00, 20% on excess over 200,000.00).
- IR = 15,000.00 + 20% × (223,200.00 − 200,000.00) = 15,000.00 + 20% × 23,200.00 = 15,000.00 + 4,640.00 = **C$19,640.00**.

**Classification:** Annual IR = **C$19,640.00**. Monthly withholding ≈ 19,640.00 / 12 = **C$1,636.67/month** (employer reconciles to the annual figure via IR-122).

### Example 3 -- Salary in the 25% band

**Input:** Resident employee, gross salary **C$40,000.00 / month** (C$480,000.00 / year).

**Reasoning:**
- Annual gross = 40,000.00 × 12 = C$480,000.00.
- INSS laboral = 7% × 480,000.00 = C$33,600.00.
- Annual taxable income = 480,000.00 − 33,600.00 = **C$446,400.00**.
- C$446,400.00 falls in the **350,000.01 – 500,000.00** band (base C$45,000.00, 25% on excess over 350,000.00).
- IR = 45,000.00 + 25% × (446,400.00 − 350,000.00) = 45,000.00 + 25% × 96,400.00 = 45,000.00 + 24,100.00 = **C$69,100.00**.

**Classification:** Annual IR = **C$69,100.00**. Monthly withholding ≈ C$5,758.33/month.

### Example 4 -- Salary in the top 30% band

**Input:** Resident employee, gross salary **C$70,000.00 / month** (C$840,000.00 / year).

**Reasoning:**
- Annual gross = 70,000.00 × 12 = C$840,000.00.
- INSS laboral = 7% × 840,000.00 = C$58,800.00.
- Annual taxable income = 840,000.00 − 58,800.00 = **C$781,200.00**.
- C$781,200.00 falls in the **500,000.01 and above** band (base C$82,500.00, 30% on excess over 500,000.00).
- IR = 82,500.00 + 30% × (781,200.00 − 500,000.00) = 82,500.00 + 30% × 281,200.00 = 82,500.00 + 84,360.00 = **C$166,860.00**.

**Classification:** Annual IR = **C$166,860.00**. Monthly withholding ≈ C$13,905.00/month.

### Example 5 -- Non-resident definitive withholding

**Input:** Non-resident, Nicaraguan-source employment payment **C$50,000.00**.

**Reasoning:**
- Non-residents are subject to **20% definitive WHT** on Nicaraguan-source income — flat, not the progressive scale.
- WHT = 20% × 50,000.00 = **C$10,000.00**.
- This is definitive; no annual reconciliation on this amount.

**Classification:** Definitive WHT = **C$10,000.00**. Net paid = C$40,000.00. **[RESEARCH GAP: check treaty before applying.]**

### Example 6 -- Bracket boundary at exactly C$100,000 taxable

**Input:** Resident employee, annual taxable income (after INSS) = **C$100,000.00** exactly.

**Reasoning:**
- C$100,000.00 is the top of the 0% exempt band (0.01 – 100,000.00).
- IR = **C$0.00**. The 15% rate applies only to income strictly above C$100,000.00.

**Classification:** Annual IR = **C$0.00**.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Scope — Rentas del Trabajo Only

**Legislation:** LCT (Ley 822) Art. 19. This skill computes IR on **employment income** (rentas del trabajo) for resident employees, plus the flat 20% definitive WHT for non-residents. Business income (rentas de actividades económicas) and capital income (rentas de capital) are out of scope (R-NI-2, R-NI-3).

### 5.2 INSS Laboral Is Deducted Before the Scale

**Legislation:** LCT Art. 19–23. The employee's **7% INSS laboral** is deducted from gross salary to arrive at taxable employment income. Apply the progressive scale to the **net-of-INSS** figure. INSS laboral is on the whole gross salary with no upper cap (RI-112-2018). **[RESEARCH GAP: confirm exact ordering / further deductions against DGI guidance.]**

### 5.3 The Progressive Scale (annual)

Apply the Section 1 scale to annual taxable income:
```
IR_annual = base_tax(band) + rate(band) × (taxable_income − lower_bound(band))
```
The first C$100,000.00 is exempt. The scale is annual; for monthly payroll, annualize (×12) before applying it, or use the C$8,333.33/month exempt equivalent.

### 5.4 Monthly Withholding (IR-122)

The employer withholds the employee's IR **monthly** through payroll and remits it on **Form IR-122** (monthly withholding income-tax return). Monthly withholding approximates annual IR ÷ 12, reconciled across the year as salary varies.

### 5.5 Annual Return (IR-106) — When Required

| Situation | Annual IR-106 return |
|---|---|
| Single employer, standard withholding, no extra deductions | **Not required** — withholding is final |
| Income from **more than one employer** totaling **over C$100,000/year** | **Required** — file IR-106 |

Form **IR-106** is the annual individual income-tax return. It is due within **90 days after year-end** (≈ 31 March). Any final payment is due with the return.

### 5.6 Non-Resident Definitive Withholding

Non-residents pay **20% definitive WHT** on Nicaraguan-source income — flat, final, no progressive scale, no annual reconciliation on the withheld amount.

### 5.7 Tax Year

Calendar year (1 January – 31 December). Alternative 12-month periods are allowed only with DGI authorization.

### 5.8 Items Not Deductible Against the IR Base

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| INATEC (2%) | Employer-paid levy; not an employee deduction |
| INSS patronal (21.5%/22.5%) | Employer cost; out of scope for employee IR |
| The IR withholding itself | It is the tax — a credit, not a deduction from the base |
| Salary advances / loans (anticipos) | Movement of cash, not income or expense |
| Court garnishments (embargos) | Do not reduce taxable income |

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Aguinaldo (13th-Month Pay) Exemption

- The aguinaldo (décimo tercer mes) is generally exempt up to the legal amount.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the exempt ceiling and whether any excess is taxable. **[RESEARCH GAP: confirm ceiling against LCT.]**

### 6.2 Statutory Severance (Indemnización)

- Statutory severance is generally exempt up to a legal limit; amounts above may be taxable.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the exempt limit and the nature of the payment.

### 6.3 Viáticos and Reimbursements

- Genuine, documented business reimbursements (viáticos) are excluded from income.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the reimbursement is genuine and documented, not disguised remuneration.

### 6.4 Multiple Employers — IR-106 Obligation

- If the employee had more than one employer and total income exceeds C$100,000/year, an IR-106 annual return is required to aggregate income and reconcile withholding.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm number of employers and total income; prepare IR-106 if triggered.

### 6.5 Residence Determination

- Residence drives progressive scale vs 20% definitive WHT.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm residence status and any treaty position before finalizing. **[RESEARCH GAP: treaty overrides.]**

### 6.6 Mid-Year Joiners / Leavers and Variable Pay

- Part-year employment and variable monthly pay require annualization and reconciliation to the annual scale.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the annualization method and year-end reconciliation.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client provides a salary figure but cannot answer onboarding questions immediately:

1. Classify all payslip/payroll lines using the pattern library (Section 3).
2. Mark all Tier 2 items as "PENDING — reviewer must confirm".
3. Apply conservative defaults (Section 1) — assume gross, deduct 7% INSS, assume córdoba.
4. Generate the working paper (Section 7) with clear flags.
5. Present the following questions to the client:

```
ONBOARDING QUESTIONS -- NICARAGUA INCOME TAX (IR)
1. Residence status: resident or non-resident of Nicaragua?
2. Is the income employment income (rentas del trabajo), or business/capital income?
3. Is the salary figure monthly or annual, and in córdobas (C$)?

**Note on source breadth:** Big Four coverage for Nicaragua individuals is essentially PwC-only on taxsummaries; EY and Deloitte do not maintain a standalone Nicaragua individual page. PwC is corroborated by Nicaraguan professional sources (CCPN — Colegio de Contadores Públicos de Nicaragua, and the firms cited above).

### Test Suite

All amounts in córdobas (C$). Each result reconciles to the cent.

**Test 1 — Below exempt threshold.**
Input: Resident, gross C$8,000/month = C$96,000/year.
INSS = 6,720.00. Taxable = 89,280.00 (≤ 100,000.00).
Expected: Annual IR = **C$0.00**.

**Test 2 — 15% band.**
Input: Resident, gross C$20,000/month = C$240,000/year.
INSS = 16,800.00. Taxable = 223,200.00.
Expected: IR = 15,000.00 + 20% × 23,200.00 = **C$19,640.00**.
(Note: taxable C$223,200 sits in the 20% band; the "15% band" label in the input refers to the headline rate the employee first crosses — the computation is correct at 20% on the excess over C$200,000.)

**Test 3 — 25% band.**
Input: Resident, gross C$40,000/month = C$480,000/year.
INSS = 33,600.00. Taxable = 446,400.00.
Expected: IR = 45,000.00 + 25% × 96,400.00 = **C$69,100.00**.

**Test 4 — 30% top band.**
Input: Resident, gross C$70,000/month = C$840,000/year.
INSS = 58,800.00. Taxable = 781,200.00.
Expected: IR = 82,500.00 + 30% × 281,200.00 = **C$166,860.00**.

**Test 5 — Non-resident definitive WHT.**
Input: Non-resident, Nicaraguan-source payment C$50,000.
Expected: 20% × 50,000.00 = **C$10,000.00** definitive WHT (no progressive scale).

**Test 6 — Exact boundary at C$100,000 taxable.**
Input: Resident, taxable income exactly C$100,000.00.
Expected: IR = **C$0.00** (15% applies only above C$100,000.00).

**Test 7 — Pure 15%-band check (taxable C$150,000).**
Input: Resident, taxable income C$150,000.00 (after INSS).
Expected: IR = 0.00 + 15% × (150,000.00 − 100,000.00) = **C$7,500.00**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER treat "NI" as Northern Ireland or UK National Insurance — this is Nicaragua. No HMRC, no £, no UK content.
- NEVER apply the progressive scale to a non-resident — non-residents get flat 20% definitive WHT.
- NEVER apply the scale without first deducting the 7% INSS laboral from gross.
- NEVER apply an INSS ceiling — RI-112-2018 eliminated the cap; INSS is on the whole gross salary.
- NEVER use the pre-2019 6.25% employee INSS rate or the stale C$130,362.60 ceiling.
- NEVER apply the annual scale to a monthly figure without annualizing (×12) first.
- NEVER treat the IR withholding itself as a deduction from the IR base — it is a credit.
- NEVER include employer INSS patronal (21.5%/22.5%) or INATEC (2%) in the employee's IR computation.
- NEVER assume USD — figures are córdobas (C$ / NIO) unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pending professional review.
