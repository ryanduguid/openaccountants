## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (IR -- Rentas del Trabajo)

The employer withholds income tax **monthly** on employment income (rentas del trabajo) and remits it to the DGI. The tax is computed by **annualizing** the employee's monthly taxable income, applying the progressive table, then dividing the annual liability by 12 (or by the number of pay periods).

**Taxable base = gross salary minus the employee's INSS contribution.** The 7% employee INSS deduction is taken **before** the IR table is applied. [PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Nicaragua, last reviewed 12 Jan 2026]

### IR Progressive Annual Brackets — residents (NIO)

[Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Nicaragua / Ley de Concertacion Tributaria (Ley 822), Art. 23. https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/nicaragua/individual/taxes-on-personal-income]

| Annual taxable income (NIO) | Base tax (NIO) | Marginal rate on excess over lower bound |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 100,000.00 | 0 | 0% (exempt) |
| 100,000.01 -- 200,000.00 | 0 | 15% |
| 200,000.01 -- 350,000.00 | 15,000 | 20% |
| 350,000.01 -- 500,000.00 | 45,000 | 25% |
| 500,000.01 and over | 82,500 | 30% |

**Cumulative-base self-check** (recomputed):
- At C$200,000: 0 + 15% x (200,000 − 100,000) = **15,000** -> matches base of next band ✓
- At C$350,000: 15,000 + 20% x (350,000 − 200,000) = 15,000 + 30,000 = **45,000** ✓
- At C$500,000: 45,000 + 25% x (500,000 − 350,000) = 45,000 + 37,500 = **82,500** ✓

### Key rules

- The first **C$100,000 of annual net employment income is exempt** (the 0% band is the tax-free allowance — there is no separate personal allowance). [PwC / Ley 822]
- **Non-residents:** flat **20% definitive withholding** on Nicaraguan-source income (no bracket table, no annualization). [PwC — Nicaragua, taxes on personal income]
- Tax year = calendar year. [PwC]

### Monthly withholding method (deterministic)

```
1. monthly_inss_employee   = gross_monthly x 0.07
2. monthly_taxable         = gross_monthly − monthly_inss_employee
3. annual_taxable          = monthly_taxable x 12          (annualize)
4. annual_IR               = base_tax(band) + rate(band) x (annual_taxable − band_floor)
5. monthly_IR_withholding  = annual_IR / 12
6. net_pay                 = gross_monthly − monthly_inss_employee − monthly_IR_withholding
```

If pay is irregular (bonuses, 13th-month aguinaldo), reconcile via the annual IR-106 return rather than the simple /12 method — flag to reviewer.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- INSS Employee Deductions (Regimen Integral)

Employee INSS is computed on **gross salary/wages** at a total of **7.00%**. Rates per the **2019 INSS reform** (effective 1 Feb 2019, current for 2025). [Latin Alliance reform summary; PwC — Nicaragua, other taxes]

### INSS Employee Contribution Components (2025)

| Component | Rate |
|---|---|
| IVM (Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte — pensions) | 4.75% |
| Enfermedad y Maternidad (health) | 2.25% |
| **Total employee** | **7.00%** |

**Component self-check:** 4.75% + 2.25% = **7.00%** ✓

### Contribution ceiling (techo de cotizacion)

- The 2019 reform **eliminated the salary cap** ("se elimina el limite maximo para la remuneracion objeto de cotizacion"). Treat as **no statutory ceiling**. [Latin Alliance — 2019 reform]
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** A secondary calculator source (calculorapido.com) cites a 2025 ceiling of **C$130,362.60/month**. This conflicts with the authoritative "no ceiling" position from the 2019 reform and could **not** be confirmed against an INSS/official source. Default to "no ceiling" unless INSS publishes otherwise; have the reviewer verify before finalizing high-earner payroll.

For biweekly (quincenal) pay, contributions are computed on the period's gross and totalled monthly on the planilla.

---

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- INSS Employer Contributions + INATEC

Employer INSS is computed on **gross salary/wages**. The total rate depends on **headcount** (the 50-employee line changes only the IVM portion). [Latin Alliance — 2019 reform; PwC]

### INSS Employer Contribution Components (2025)

| Component | < 50 employees | >= 50 employees |
|---|---|---|
| IVM (pensions) | 12.5% | 13.5% |
| Enfermedad y Maternidad (health) | 6.0% | 6.0% |
| Riesgos Profesionales (occupational risk) | 1.5% | 1.5% |
| Victimas de Guerra (war victims) | 1.5% | 1.5% |
| **Total employer INSS** | **21.5%** | **22.5%** |

**Component self-check:**
- < 50: 12.5 + 6.0 + 1.5 + 1.5 = **21.5%** ✓
- >= 50: 13.5 + 6.0 + 1.5 + 1.5 = **22.5%** ✓

### INATEC training levy

| Levy | Rate | Base | Paid by | Collected via |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| INATEC | 2.0% | Total gross monthly payroll | Employer (NOT deducted from employees) | Same monthly INSS invoice (INSS is collection agent) |

[Source: serviciocontablenicaragua.com — gestion de nomina; INATEC levy decree https://ni.vlex.com/vid/reglamento-recaudo-aporte-mensual-36219852]

### Total employer payroll burden

| Headcount | INSS employer | INATEC | **Total employer burden** |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 50 employees | 21.5% | 2.0% | **23.5%** |
| >= 50 employees | 22.5% | 2.0% | **24.5%** |

**Self-check:** 21.5 + 2.0 = **23.5%** ✓ ; 22.5 + 2.0 = **24.5%** ✓

---

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage (effective 1 March 2025 -- 28 February 2026)

A **4% increase** was agreed by the Comision Nacional de Salario Minimo, effective 1 March 2025. Monthly minimums by sector (NIO/month). [Bloomberg Linea, 28 Feb 2025; CNZF confirmation of 4% rise]

| Sector | Monthly minimum (C$) |
|---|---|
| Agropecuario (agriculture) | 5,950.02 |
| Micro/pequena industria artesanal y turistica | 6,268.43 |
| Gobierno Central y Municipal | 7,419.90 |
| Minas, canteras e industria manufacturera | 8,046.00 |
| Pesca (fishing) | 9,047.20 |
| Electricidad/gas/agua, comercio, restaurantes, hoteles, transporte, comunicaciones | 10,913.54 |
| Construccion, establecimientos financieros y seguros | 13,315.61 |
| Industria sujeta a regimen fiscal (zonas francas / maquila) | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** — set separately; not isolated in sources. Verify with MITRAB. |

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing, apply the **most conservative defensible assumption**, label the output **ESTIMATED**, and surface the assumption for reviewer confirmation.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Residence status | Treat as **resident** (use bracket table) ONLY if local employment is confirmed; otherwise flag. Apply 20% non-resident withholding only when non-residence is documented. | Resident brackets give a tax-free band; choosing wrongly under-withholds. Flag either way. |
| Employer headcount (for INSS rate) | Use **22.5%** (>= 50 employees rate) unless headcount < 50 is confirmed | Higher employer rate avoids under-accruing the employer liability. |
| INSS ceiling | **No ceiling** (per 2019 reform) | Authoritative position; computes the full 7% / 21.5--22.5%. Reviewer to confirm the disputed C$130,362.60 figure. |
| Sector minimum wage | Use the **highest plausible applicable** sector rate when sector is ambiguous | Prevents paying below the statutory floor. |
| Pay frequency | Monthly | Most common in Nicaragua. |
| Aguinaldo (13th month) | Assume payable (mandatory under Codigo del Trabajo) and flag for separate treatment | 13th-month is a statutory entitlement; omitting it understates cost. |

Never silently fill a gap — every default must appear in the output with a "(assumed)" tag.

---

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

### Minimum required inputs to compute a payslip

1. Gross monthly salary (C$)
2. Pay frequency (monthly / quincenal)
3. Employee residence status (resident / non-resident)
4. Employer headcount band (< 50 or >= 50 employees) — for the employer INSS rate
5. Sector (to validate against minimum wage)

### Refusal Catalogue — STOP and request input; do NOT guess

| Missing / ambiguous input | Action |
|---|---|
| Gross salary not provided | REFUSE to compute; request the gross figure |
| Currency stated as anything other than NIO/C$ | REFUSE; confirm the cordoba amount (do not FX-convert silently) |
| Residence status unknown AND salary is high | REFUSE to finalize; resident vs 20% non-resident materially changes tax |
| Headcount band unknown | Compute with the 22.5% default, label ESTIMATED, request confirmation |
| Request to compute net pay below the sector minimum wage | REFUSE; warn that the gross breaches the statutory minimum |
| Request to omit INSS or INATEC to "lower cost" | REFUSE; these are mandatory statutory charges |
| Request for definitive/final figures without accountant review | REFUSE to label as final; output is ESTIMATED only |

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All figures in NIO (C$). INSS employee = 7%. Resident IR uses the Section 2 bracket table on the **annualized** base. Each example is recomputed end-to-end below.

### Example A — Mid earner, small firm (< 50 employees)

Gross monthly: **C$30,000**. Resident. Sector: commerce. Headcount < 50.

| Step | Computation | Result (C$) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee INSS (monthly) | 30,000 x 7% | 2,100.00 |
| Monthly taxable | 30,000 − 2,100 | 27,900.00 |
| Annualized taxable | 27,900 x 12 | 334,800.00 |
| Band | 200,000.01 -- 350,000 (base 15,000, 20%) | — |
| Annual IR | 15,000 + 20% x (334,800 − 200,000) = 15,000 + 26,960 | 41,960.00 |
| Monthly IR | 41,960 / 12 | 3,496.67 |
| **Net pay (monthly)** | 30,000 − 2,100 − 3,496.67 | **24,403.33** |
| Employer INSS | 30,000 x 21.5% | 6,450.00 |
| INATEC | 30,000 x 2% | 600.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | 30,000 + 6,450 + 600 | **37,050.00** |

### Example B — Commerce minimum wage

Gross monthly: **C$10,913.54** (commerce sector minimum). Resident. Headcount < 50.

| Step | Computation | Result (C$) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee INSS | 10,913.54 x 7% | 763.95 |
| Monthly taxable | 10,913.54 − 763.95 | 10,149.59 |
| Annualized taxable | 10,149.59 x 12 | 121,795.08 |
| Band | 100,000.01 -- 200,000 (15%) | — |
| Annual IR | 15% x (121,795.08 − 100,000) = 15% x 21,795.08 | 3,269.26 |
| Monthly IR | 3,269.26 / 12 | 272.44 |
| **Net pay (monthly)** | 10,913.54 − 763.95 − 272.44 | **9,877.15** |
| Employer INSS | 10,913.54 x 21.5% | 2,346.41 |
| INATEC | 10,913.54 x 2% | 218.27 |
| **Total employer cost** | 10,913.54 + 2,346.41 + 218.27 | **13,478.22** |

### Example C — Exempt low earner (manufacturing minimum)

Gross monthly: **C$8,046.00** (minas/manufactura minimum). Resident. Headcount < 50.

| Step | Computation | Result (C$) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee INSS | 8,046 x 7% | 563.22 |
| Monthly taxable | 8,046 − 563.22 | 7,482.78 |
| Annualized taxable | 7,482.78 x 12 | 89,793.36 |
| Band | 0 -- 100,000 (0% exempt) | — |
| Annual IR | 0 (below C$100,000 exemption) | 0.00 |
| Monthly IR | — | 0.00 |
| **Net pay (monthly)** | 8,046 − 563.22 − 0 | **7,482.78** |
| Employer INSS | 8,046 x 21.5% | 1,729.89 |
| INATEC | 8,046 x 2% | 160.92 |
| **Total employer cost** | 8,046 + 1,729.89 + 160.92 | **9,936.81** |

### Example D — High earner, large firm (>= 50 employees)

Gross monthly: **C$60,000**. Resident. Headcount >= 50.

| Step | Computation | Result (C$) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee INSS | 60,000 x 7% | 4,200.00 |
| Monthly taxable | 60,000 − 4,200 | 55,800.00 |
| Annualized taxable | 55,800 x 12 | 669,600.00 |
| Band | 500,000.01+ (base 82,500, 30%) | — |
| Annual IR | 82,500 + 30% x (669,600 − 500,000) = 82,500 + 50,880 | 133,380.00 |
| Monthly IR | 133,380 / 12 | 11,115.00 |
| **Net pay (monthly)** | 60,000 − 4,200 − 11,115 | **44,685.00** |
| Employer INSS | 60,000 x 22.5% | 13,500.00 |
| INATEC | 60,000 x 2% | 1,200.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | 60,000 + 13,500 + 1,200 | **74,700.00** |

### Example E — Non-resident employee

Gross monthly: **C$50,000**. **Non-resident** (flat 20% definitive withholding, no bracket table, no exemption). [PwC]

| Step | Computation | Result (C$) |
|---|---|---|
| IR (definitive) | 50,000 x 20% | 10,000.00 |
| Income net of IR | 50,000 − 10,000 | 40,000.00 |
| Employee INSS (if locally employed) | 50,000 x 7% | 3,500.00 — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm INSS applicability to this non-resident's contract]** |
| **Net pay (if INSS applies)** | 50,000 − 10,000 − 3,500 | **36,500.00** |
| Employer INSS (>= 50) | 50,000 x 22.5% | 11,250.00 |
| INATEC | 50,000 x 2% | 1,000.00 |

Whether INSS applies to a non-resident depends on the employment relationship; confirm with the reviewer before finalizing.

---

## Section 10 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply automatically)

1. **Employee INSS = 7.00% of gross**, deducted before IR. [2019 reform]
2. **IR taxable base = gross − employee INSS.** [PwC / Ley 822]
3. **Annualize** monthly taxable income before applying the IR table; divide the resulting annual IR by 12 for the monthly withholding.
4. **First C$100,000 annual net is exempt** (0% band). [Ley 822 Art. 23]
5. **Non-residents: flat 20% definitive withholding**, no brackets, no exemption. [PwC]
6. **Employer INSS = 21.5% (< 50 staff) or 22.5% (>= 50 staff) of gross.** [2019 reform]
7. **INATEC = 2.0% of gross payroll**, employer-paid, via the INSS invoice. [INATEC decree]
8. **Gross must not be below the applicable sector minimum wage.** [CNSM / Bloomberg Linea]
9. **INSS and IR are remitted separately**: INSS+INATEC on the combined INSS invoice; IR via DGI Form IR-122.
10. Treat INSS as having **no contribution ceiling** unless the reviewer confirms otherwise.

## Section 11 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These require a licensed Nicaraguan accountant's judgement — surface them, do not auto-resolve.

| Topic | Why it needs judgement |
|---|---|
| INSS contribution ceiling | Conflicting sources (no cap vs C$130,362.60/month). **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Aguinaldo (13th month) taxation | Interaction of the statutory 13th-month payment with the annual IR reconciliation. |
| Bonuses / variable pay | Irregular pay distorts the simple /12 annualization; reconcile on IR-106. |
| Non-resident INSS applicability | Depends on contract type and local-employment status. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Zona franca / maquila minimum wage | Set separately by sector agreement. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Expat / dual-coverage cases | Totalization, foreign social security, treaty positions. |
| Severance (liquidacion / indemnizacion) | Tax and INSS treatment of termination payments. |
| Exact DGI penalty percentages | Codigo Tributario figures not confirmed. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Employees with 2+ employers | Aggregate-income filing obligation (> C$100,000/yr). |

## Section 12 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Recommended columns for a monthly payroll working paper (one row per employee).

| Col | Header | Formula / source |
|---|---|---|
| A | Employee name | input |
| B | RUC / cedula | input |
| C | Sector | input |
| D | Residence (R/NR) | input |
| E | Gross monthly (C$) | input |
| F | Sector minimum (C$) | lookup (Section 5) — flag if E < F |
| G | Employee INSS 7% | =E*0.07 |
| H | Monthly taxable | =E-G |
| I | Annualized taxable | =H*12 |
| J | Annual IR | bracket formula on I (Section 2) |
| K | Monthly IR | =J/12 (resident) or =E*0.20 (non-resident definitive) |
| L | Net pay | =E-G-K |
| M | Employer INSS % | 0.215 (<50) or 0.225 (>=50) |
| N | Employer INSS (C$) | =E*M |
| O | INATEC 2% | =E*0.02 |
| P | Total employer cost | =E+N+O |

Footer checks (must hold):
- `SUM(G) + SUM(K)` = total deductions remitted (INSS employee + IR)
- `SUM(N) + SUM(G) + SUM(O)` = total on the INSS/INATEC invoice + (note IR is separate to DGI)
- `SUM(L) + SUM(G) + SUM(K)` = `SUM(E)` (net + deductions = gross) for each resident row

## Section 13 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

Common Nicaraguan payroll and statement terms (Spanish -> meaning):

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Nomina / planilla | Payroll |
| Salario bruto | Gross salary |
| Salario neto | Net salary |
| Quincena / quincenal | Biweekly pay period |
| INSS laboral | Employee social-security deduction (7%) |
| INSS patronal | Employer social-security contribution (21.5% / 22.5%) |
| IVM | Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte (pension portion of INSS) |
| Retencion IR | Income-tax withholding (rentas del trabajo) |
| Aguinaldo / treceavo mes | 13th-month statutory bonus |
| Liquidacion | Final settlement on termination |
| Indemnizacion | Severance pay |
| RUC | Registro Unico del Contribuyente (taxpayer ID) |
| Cedula | National ID number |
| VET | Ventanilla Electronica Tributaria (DGI e-filing portal) |
| SIE | INSS electronic planilla system |

When reading a statement: a single combined **"INSS"** debit usually bundles employee 7% + employer 21.5/22.5% + INATEC 2%. The **"DGI" / "IR-122"** debit is the income-tax remittance and is always separate.

---

## Section 14 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client cannot supply structured payroll data, gather the minimum manually:

1. **List each employee** with gross monthly salary and sector.
2. **Confirm headcount band** (< 50 or >= 50) once for the whole employer.
3. **Confirm residence** for any foreign staff.
4. **Confirm registrations exist**: INSS employer registration + DGI withholding-agent (RUC) registration. If either is missing, STOP and escalate — payroll cannot be legally run without them.
5. If no prior planillas exist, reconstruct the last 3 months from bank debits tagged "INSS" and "DGI/IR" using the Section 8 pattern library, and flag for reviewer.
6. Default any remaining gap per Section 6 and label all output **ESTIMATED**.

## Section 15 -- Filing Obligations, Registration & Penalties

### Registration thresholds

| Obligation | Trigger | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Register as employer + enrol worker (Regimen Integral) | **At least one employee** (no headcount minimum) | INSS |
| Register as withholding agent (RUC) for PAYE | Operating IR-122 withholding | DGI |
| 50-employee line | Changes only the **employer INSS rate** (21.5% -> 22.5%), not the obligation to register | INSS |

A precise statutory registration **deadline window** could not be isolated from an official page — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

### Income tax (DGI) filing

| Form | Purpose | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| IR-122 | Monthly IR withholding remittance | Within the first days of the following month — commonly stated as the **first 5 working days**, but the exact day was **not** confirmed from an official DGI source. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** [PwC tax administration] |
| IR-106 | Annual IR return | Within **90 days after year-end** (~31 March). For TY2025, DGI announced Form 106 with deadline **28 February 2026**. [EY Nicaragua DGI annual-declaration alert] |

Employees with a **single employer** and no education/health/professional-service deductions are **exempt from filing**. Employees with **two or more employers** whose aggregate income exceeds **C$100,000/year** must file annually. [PwC tax administration]

### Social security (INSS) filing

| Item | Deadline |
|---|---|
| Monthly contributions + planilla (SIE) | Within the **first 10 business days** of the month following accrual. [INSS / Reglamento General de la Ley de Seguridad Social] |

### Penalties

| Charge | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| INSS late payment (recargo por mora) | **2% monthly interest** on amount owed, capitalizing from due date | INSS Reglamento General; worki360 |
| INSS late/failed planilla submission | **2% surcharge** | INSS Reglamento General |
| INSS administrative fines | Additional fixed/proportional fines may apply | INSS |
| DGI late filing/payment (IR) | Codigo Tributario generally imposes a monthly surcharge (recargo por mora) plus interest (mantenimiento de valor); **exact current percentages NOT confirmed from an authoritative DGI source.** **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against Codigo Tributario / Ley 562]** | — |

## Section 16 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (IR + INSS + INATEC) | **This skill (nicaragua-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed / independent income tax | nicaragua-income-tax.md (if available) |
| Nicaragua IVA (VAT) returns | nicaragua-vat-return.md (if available) |
| Nicaragua bookkeeping | nicaragua-bookkeeping.md (if available) |
| Employer corporate income tax (IR Anual) | nicaragua-corporate-tax.md (if available) |

### Key handoff points

- **Payroll -> Bookkeeping:** Gross wages, employer INSS, and INATEC are expenses; employee INSS and IR withholding are liabilities until remitted.
- **Payroll -> Income Tax:** Annual employment income feeds the employee's IR-106 where a return is required.
- **Payroll -> Social Security:** INSS Regimen Integral contributions count toward pension (IVM) entitlement.

### Numbered Test Suite (recompute to confirm before relying on this skill)

1. **Bracket boundary @ C$200,000 annual taxable** -> IR = 0 + 15% x 100,000 = **C$15,000**. ✓
2. **Bracket boundary @ C$350,000** -> 15,000 + 20% x 150,000 = **C$45,000**. ✓
3. **Bracket boundary @ C$500,000** -> 45,000 + 25% x 150,000 = **C$82,500**. ✓
4. **Example A net pay** (gross 30,000) -> 30,000 − 2,100 − 3,496.67 = **C$24,403.33**. ✓
5. **Example B net pay** (commerce min 10,913.54) -> 10,913.54 − 763.95 − 272.44 = **C$9,877.15**. ✓
6. **Example C exempt** (8,046) -> annualized taxable 89,793.36 < 100,000 -> IR = **0**; net = **C$7,482.78**. ✓
7. **Example D net pay** (60,000, >=50) -> 60,000 − 4,200 − 11,115 = **C$44,685.00**. ✓
8. **Employer total cost, Example A** -> 30,000 + 6,450 + 600 = **C$37,050.00**. ✓
9. **Employer total cost, Example D** -> 60,000 + 13,500 + 1,200 = **C$74,700.00**. ✓
10. **Employee INSS components** -> 4.75% + 2.25% = **7.00%**. ✓
11. **Employer INSS >= 50 components** -> 13.5 + 6.0 + 1.5 + 1.5 = **22.5%**. ✓
12. **Employer burden < 50** -> 21.5% + 2.0% INATEC = **23.5%**. ✓
13. **Non-resident IR** (Example E, 50,000) -> 50,000 x 20% = **C$10,000**. ✓
14. **Net + deductions = gross** (Example A) -> 24,403.33 + 2,100 + 3,496.67 = **30,000.00**. ✓

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the IR table to gross salary — the base is gross **minus** the 7% employee INSS.
- NEVER skip annualizing monthly taxable income before applying the IR brackets.
- NEVER apply resident brackets to a confirmed non-resident — use the flat **20% definitive** withholding.
- NEVER omit the **INATEC 2%** employer levy.
- NEVER use the **same** employer INSS rate for all clients — confirm the < 50 vs >= 50 headcount band.
- NEVER deduct INATEC from the employee — it is an employer-only charge.
- NEVER pay a gross below the applicable **sector minimum wage**.
- NEVER assume a current **INSS contribution ceiling** — the 2019 reform removed it; the C$130,362.60 figure is unconfirmed.
- NEVER run payroll without confirming the employer's **INSS** and **DGI (RUC) withholding-agent** registrations.
- NEVER FX-convert a non-cordoba figure silently — all computation is in NIO/C$.
- NEVER present any computation as definitive — label as **ESTIMATED** and direct to a licensed Nicaraguan accountant.
