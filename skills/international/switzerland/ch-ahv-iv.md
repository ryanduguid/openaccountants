## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

Before computing any AHV/IV figure, you MUST obtain:

1. **Self-employment status** -- is the client recognized as selbständig erwerbend by the Ausgleichskasse?
2. **Net earned income from self-employment** -- Reineinkommen from all self-employed activities
3. **Which Ausgleichskasse?** -- cantonal or professional (e.g., Medisuisse for doctors)
4. **Age** -- contributions start at 18 (20 for employed), end at reference age (65M/65F from 2028)
5. **Any concurrent employment?** -- employer already pays AHV on wages
6. **Interest in voluntary BVG (Pillar 2)?** -- optional for self-employed

**If self-employment status is not confirmed by the Ausgleichskasse, STOP. The Ausgleichskasse determines status, not the client.**

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-CH-AHV-1 -- Cantonal supplements (AG/AI)** — Trigger: question about cantonal-specific AHV supplement rules. Message: "Cantonal AHV supplement rules are outside this skill's scope. Consult the relevant cantonal Ausgleichskasse."
- **R-CH-AHV-2 -- Military service credits** — Trigger: question about military service contribution credits. Message: "Military service contribution credits require specialist review. Escalate to qualified Treuhänder."

### Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions list** — NEVER determine self-employment status yourself -- only the Ausgleichskasse can confirm this; NEVER apply the full 10% rate to incomes below CHF 60,500 -- the sliding scale must be used; NEVER state there is a maximum cap on AHV/IV contributions -- there is no upper cap in Switzerland; NEVER ignore the CHF 530 minimum contribution -- it always applies regardless of income level; NEVER confuse the self-employed contribution (full rate) with the employee half-rate (5.00%); NEVER forget the Freibetrag (CHF 16,800) for persons past reference age; NEVER present AHV figures without noting that final settlement depends on the definitive tax assessment; NEVER ignore FAK cantonal obligations -- rates and rules vary by canton

## Section 3 -- Contribution base

- **Contribution base formula** — contribution_base = net_self_employment_income = gross_revenue - business_expenses - depreciation + capital_gains_on_business_assets (if applicable)  _(AHVG art. 9; AHVV art. 17-22)_

### Key rules for the base

- **Key rules for the base** — 1. The base is the Reineinkommen (net income) from self-employment as determined by the tax assessment 2. Personal AHV/IV/EO contributions paid are added back (50% gross-up rule): the actual base = Reineinkommen + 50% of contributions due (to approximate the employer half) 3. Interest on business capital is deducted from the base 4. The Ausgleichskasse uses the definitive tax assessment from the cantonal tax authority  _(AHVG art. 9; AHVV art. 17-22)_

## Section 4 -- Rates and thresholds (2025)

**Legislation:** AHVG art. 8; AHVV art. 21

### Rate components

**Rate components**  _(AHVG art. 8; AHVV art. 21)_

| Component | Full rate (income >= CHF 60,500) |
| --- | --- |
| AHV (old-age and survivors) | 8.10% |
| IV (disability) | 1.40% |
| EO (income replacement / maternity) | 0.50% |
| **Total** | **10.00%** |

### Sliding scale (Sinkende Beitragsskala)

**Sliding scale (Sinkende Beitragsskala)**  _(AHVG art. 8; AHVV art. 21)_

| Annual net income | AHV/IV/EO rate |
| --- | --- |
| Up to CHF 10,100 | Minimum contribution (CHF 530/year) |
| CHF 10,100 | 5.371% |
| CHF 17,400 | 5.509% |
| CHF 21,400 | 5.666% |
| CHF 25,200 | 5.859% |
| CHF 28,900 | 6.101% |
| CHF 32,600 | 6.405% |
| CHF 36,100 | 6.783% |
| CHF 39,600 | 7.226% |
| CHF 42,900 | 7.726% |
| CHF 46,200 | 8.271% |
| CHF 49,200 | 8.849% |
| CHF 52,200 | 9.444% |
| CHF 55,400 | 9.953% |
| CHF 60,500 and above | 10.000% |

### Additional charges

- **FAK (Familienausgleichskasse)** — Some cantons require self-employed to pay FAK contributions, typically 1-3%
- **Administration costs (Verwaltungskosten)** — Typically 1-5% of contributions, charged by the Ausgleichskasse

### Voluntary BVG (Pillar 2) and Pillar 3a

**Voluntary BVG (Pillar 2) and Pillar 3a**

| Parameter | Amount (2025) |
| --- | --- |
| BVG minimum insured salary | CHF 22,680 |
| BVG maximum insured salary | CHF 90,720 |
| Pillar 3a with BVG | Max CHF 7,258 |
| Pillar 3a without BVG | Max 20% of net income, up to CHF 36,288 |

Self-employed persons are NOT obligatorily insured under BVG but may join voluntarily. Contribution rates are age-dependent: 7% (25-34), 10% (35-44), 15% (45-54), 18% (55-65). Confirm specific fund rules with the Stiftung before advising.

## Section 5 -- Computation steps

### Step 5.1 -- Determine net income and apply gross-up

- **Gross-up formula** — raw_income = net_self_employment_income_per_tax_assessment adjusted_income = raw_income + (AHV_contributions_paid x 50%) In practice, the Ausgleichskasse computes this via published tables.

### Step 5.2 -- Apply sliding scale or full rate

- **Sliding scale / full rate application** — IF adjusted_income <= 9,800: annual_contribution = 514  (minimum) ELIF adjusted_income < 58,800: annual_contribution = adjusted_income x sliding_scale_rate  (from table) ELSE: annual_contribution = adjusted_income x 10.00%

### Step 5.3 -- Add FAK if applicable

- **FAK addition** — IF canton_requires_FAK: FAK = adjusted_income x cantonal_FAK_rate total = annual_contribution + FAK

### Step 5.4 -- Administration costs

The Ausgleichskasse charges Verwaltungskosten, typically 1-5% of contributions.

## Section 6 -- Payment schedule and tax deductibility

**Legislation:** AHVV art. 34-36; DBG art. 33(1)(d)

### Payment schedule

- **Payment schedule details** — Self-employed pay quarterly advance payments (Akontobeiträge); Advances are based on prior-year income or estimated current-year income; Final settlement occurs after the definitive tax assessment (often 1-2 years later); Late payment: Verzugszinsen at 5% per annum (AHVV art. 41bis); Advances can be adjusted up or down upon request with justification  _(AHVV art. 34-36; DBG art. 33(1)(d))_

### Tax deductibility

**Tax deductibility**  _(AHVV art. 34-36; DBG art. 33(1)(d))_

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Are AHV/IV/EO contributions deductible? | YES -- from income for federal and cantonal tax |
| Classification | Personal deduction (Versicherungsabzug), not business expense |
| When deductible? | In the year they relate to (accrual basis for contributions) |

## Section 7 -- Post-reference-age and concurrent employment

### Person approaching or past reference age

- **Post-reference-age rules** — Contributions are due until the end of the month in which the client reaches reference age. After reference age, a Freibetrag of CHF 16,800/year applies -- no contributions on income below this. Above the Freibetrag, standard rates apply but only AHV/EO (no IV).

### Concurrent employment and self-employment

- **Concurrent employment rule** — AHV is due separately on self-employment income. No offset between employment and self-employment contributions. Even if total employment income already exceeds the full-rate threshold, self-employment contributions are calculated independently on self-employment income alone.

### Non-cash income / benefits in kind

- **Benefits in kind rule** — All income including benefits in kind must be included in the AHV contribution base at fair market value.

### Business cessation mid-year

- **Business cessation rule** — Contributions are pro-rated for the period of activity. Minimum contribution is also pro-rated (1/12 per month of activity). Final settlement based on actual income for the partial year.

## Section 8 -- Edge case registry

### EC1 -- Income below minimum threshold

- **EC1 -- Income below minimum threshold** — **Situation:** Client's net self-employment income is CHF 5,000. **Resolution:** Minimum contribution of CHF 530/year applies. Client cannot pay less than the minimum regardless of income level.

### EC2 -- Concurrent employment and self-employment

- **EC2 -- Concurrent employment and self-employment** — **Situation:** Client is employed (AHV paid by employer on salary) and also self-employed. **Resolution:** AHV is due separately on self-employment income. No offset.

### EC3 -- Capital gains on business assets

- **EC3 -- Capital gains on business assets** — **Situation:** Client sells a business asset at a gain. **Resolution:** Capital gains on business assets (Kapitalgewinne auf Geschäftsvermögen) are subject to AHV/IV/EO contributions as part of the self-employment income base.

### EC4 -- Persons without gainful employment

- **EC4 -- Persons without gainful employment** — **Situation:** Client has no income but is resident in Switzerland. **Resolution:** Non-employed persons pay AHV/IV/EO based on wealth and pension income. Minimum CHF 530/year. Calculation based on Rentnertabelle, confirm with Ausgleichskasse. Flag for reviewer.

### EC5 -- International coordination (EU/EFTA)

- **EC5 -- International coordination (EU/EFTA)** — **Situation:** Client works in Switzerland and an EU/EFTA country. **Resolution:** Under the Agreement on Free Movement of Persons, social insurance is generally payable in one country only. A1 certificate required. Escalate to reviewer.

## Section 9 -- Reviewer escalation protocol

When a situation requires reviewer judgement:

```
REVIEWER FLAG
Tier: T2
Client: [name]
Situation: [description]
Issue: [what is ambiguous]
Options: [possible treatments]
Recommended: [most likely correct treatment and why]
Action Required: Qualified Treuhänder must confirm before advising client.
```

When a situation is outside skill scope:

```
ESCALATION REQUIRED
Tier: T3
Client: [name]
Situation: [description]
Issue: [outside skill scope]
Action Required: Do not advise. Refer to qualified Treuhänder. Document gap.
```

## Section 10 -- Test suite

### Test 1 -- Income at full rate

**Input:** Net self-employment income CHF 100,000, age 40.
**Expected output:** AHV/IV/EO = CHF 100,000 x 10.00% = CHF 10,000. Plus administration costs.

### Test 2 -- Income in sliding scale range

**Input:** Net self-employment income CHF 40,000, age 35.
**Expected output:** Approximately CHF 40,000 x ~7.2% = ~CHF 2,880 (exact rate from Ausgleichskasse table). Plus administration costs.

### Test 3 -- Minimum contribution

**Input:** Net self-employment income CHF 5,000, age 30.
**Expected output:** Minimum contribution CHF 530/year.

### Test 4 -- Very high income (no cap)

**Input:** Net self-employment income CHF 500,000, age 50.
**Expected output:** AHV/IV/EO = CHF 500,000 x 10.00% = CHF 50,000. No upper cap.

### Test 5 -- Post-reference-age with Freibetrag

**Input:** Net self-employment income CHF 25,000, age 67.
**Expected output:** Freibetrag = CHF 16,800. Contributory income = CHF 8,200. Below minimum threshold of CHF 10,100, so minimum of CHF 530 applies (AHV/EO only, no IV).

### Test 6 -- Concurrent employment + self-employment

**Input:** Employment salary CHF 80,000 (AHV paid by employer), self-employment income CHF 30,000, age 38.
**Expected output:** Self-employment AHV/IV/EO on CHF 30,000 at sliding scale rate (~6.4%) = ~CHF 1,920. Employment AHV handled separately.

### Test 7 -- Pillar 3a without BVG

**Input:** Self-employed, no BVG, net income CHF 120,000, age 42.
**Expected output:** Maximum Pillar 3a = 20% x CHF 120,000 = CHF 24,000, capped at CHF 36,288. Deductible: CHF 24,000.
