description: Use this skill whenever asked about Jamaica personal income tax for self-employed individuals or employees with additional income. Trigger on phrases like "how much tax do I pay in Jamaica", "S04 return", "IT01 return", "chargeable income", "tax-free threshold", "NIS contributions", "NHT contributions", "Education Tax", "HEART levy", "PAYE Jamaica", "self-employed tax Jamaica", "TAJ filing", "statutory deductions Jamaica", or any question about filing or computing income tax for a self-employed person or an employee with other income sources in Jamaica. Also trigger when computing payroll deductions, quarterly estimated tax (S04A), NIS ceiling, NHT contributions, Education Tax, or capital allowances for a Jamaican taxpayer. This skill covers income tax rates and brackets, the tax-free threshold (including the April 2025 mid-year increase), statutory contributions (NIS, NHT, Education Tax, HEART), allowable deductions, capital allowances, filing forms and deadlines, penalties, and GCT registration requirements for small businesses. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Jamaica income tax work.

### Income Tax Rate Brackets (2025)

**Income Tax Rate Brackets (2025)**  _(Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Jamaica Individual (reviewed 31 Dec 2025); https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)_

| Band | Annual Chargeable Income Above Threshold | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lower band | Up to JMD 6,000,000 | 25% |
| Higher band | Above JMD 6,000,000 | 30% |

- **Non-residents tax rate** — Non-residents: taxed at a flat 25% from the first dollar, with no tax-free threshold available.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Individual.)_
- **Basis of taxation** — Residents (domiciled in Jamaica) are taxed on worldwide income. Non-residents are taxed on Jamaica-source income only.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Individual.)_

Jamaica uses a two-band progressive structure applied to chargeable income ABOVE the tax-free threshold. The threshold itself is tax-free.

### Tax-Free Threshold (2025) — Mid-Year Adjusted

**Tax-Free Threshold (2025) table**  _(Source: Orbitax citing TAJ Technical Advisory #042025/01/IT-TA; https://orbitax.com/news/country/article/Jamaica-Explains-Increase-in-A-59152. Official advisory PDF: https://www.jamaicatax.gov.jm/documents/10194/52231399/Technical_Advisory_Threshold+_042025.pdf/c4adbf81-8ddd-9a1b-9e8b-8bdc431162df)_

| Period | Annual Threshold | Monthly Equivalent | Weekly Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Jan 2025 -- 31 Mar 2025 | JMD 1,700,088 | JMD 141,674 | JMD 32,694 |
| 1 Apr 2025 -- 31 Dec 2025 | JMD 1,799,376 | JMD 149,948 | JMD 34,603 |
| **Full-year 2025 blended effective threshold** | **JMD 1,774,554** | -- | -- |

- **Blended threshold derivation** — (3/12 x JMD 1,700,088) + (9/12 x JMD 1,799,376) = JMD 425,022 + JMD 1,349,532 = JMD 1,774,554  _(Source: Orbitax citing TAJ Technical Advisory #042025/01/IT-TA)_

**Upcoming confirmed increases (2025/26 budget)**  _(Source: JIS; https://jis.gov.jm/increase-in-income-tax-threshold-now-in-effect/)_

| Effective Date | Annual Threshold | Full-Year Blended |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Apr 2026 | JMD 1,902,360 | JMD 1,876,614 |
| 1 Apr 2027 | JMD 2,003,496 | [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm blended] |

### Additional Exemptions on Top of the Threshold

**Additional Exemptions table**  _(Source: JIS; https://jis.gov.jm/increase-in-income-tax-threshold-now-in-effect/ and https://jis.gov.jm/taj-develops-technical-advisory-for-revised-income-tax-threshold-and-pension-exemptions/)_

| Category | Additional Annual Exemption |
| --- | --- |
| Pensioner (from approved superannuation scheme, any age) | JMD 250,040 |
| Golden Ager (aged 65 or over) | JMD 250,040 |
| Pensioner AND aged 65+ (both) | JMD 500,080 combined additional |

Example for 2025: a pensioner aged 65+ has total tax-free income = JMD 1,774,554 + JMD 500,080 = JMD 2,274,634.

### Statutory Contribution Rates — 2025

**A. National Insurance Scheme (NIS)**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes. Ceiling raised to JMD 5,000,000 by Cabinet in 2022; remained at JMD 5,000,000 through 2025.)_

| Contributor | Rate | Annual Insurable Earnings Ceiling | Maximum Annual Contribution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 3% | JMD 5,000,000 | JMD 150,000 |
| Employer | 3% | JMD 5,000,000 | JMD 150,000 |
| Self-employed | 6% | JMD 5,000,000 | JMD 300,000 |

- **NIS deductibility** — NIS contributions are income-tax deductible for the contributor.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes)_

**B. National Housing Trust (NHT)**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes. NHT official site: https://www.nht.gov.jm/self-employed-contributions)_

| Contributor | Rate | Annual Earnings Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 2% | None — all gross emoluments |
| Employer | 3% | None — all gross emoluments |
| Self-employed | 3% | None — applied to net statutory income after allowable expenses |

- **NHT refund rule** — Employee contributions accumulate in an individual account and are refundable after 7 years of contributions (or at age 65) if no mortgage is drawn. Employer contributions are non-refundable. Expatriates may claim a refund of employee NHT on permanent departure.  _(NHT official site: https://www.nht.gov.jm/self-employed-contributions)_

**C. Education Tax**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes. Dawgen Global compliance guide: https://www.dawgen.global/payroll-and-statutory-deductions-paye-nis-nht-education-tax-and-heart-every-employers-complete-compliance-guide/)_

| Contributor | Rate | Annual Earnings Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 2.25% | None |
| Employer | 3.5% | None |
| Self-employed | 2.25% | None |

- **Education Tax base and no threshold exemption** — Calculated on statutory income AFTER deduction of NIS contributions (and approved superannuation). There is NO earnings ceiling. Education Tax has NO threshold exemption — employees who fall below the income tax threshold still pay Education Tax on ALL earnings. This is a frequent compliance error.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes)_

**D. HEART Trust/NSTA Levy**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes)_

| Contributor | Rate | Applies When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 0% (none) | n/a |
| Employer | 3% | Employer has 3 or more employees |

- **HEART levy application** — Employer-only levy on total gross payroll. No earnings ceiling. Tax-deductible for the employer. Applies from the first dollar of payroll once the employer has 3 or more employees. Note: one secondary source cited a monthly payroll threshold of approximately JMD 292,300 (2026 figure) in addition to the employee-count test — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm from current HEART Trust/NSTA Act].  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Other Taxes; https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/other-taxes)_

### Summary: Total Statutory Contribution Rates (2025)

**Employee on-cost**

| Contribution | Employee Rate | Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NIS | 3% | JMD 5,000,000 p.a. |
| NHT | 2% | None |
| Education Tax | 2.25% | None (on income net of NIS) |
| **Total employee deductions** | **~7.25%** (blended; NIS ceiling applies) | — |

**Employer on-cost**

| Contribution | Employer Rate | Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NIS | 3% | JMD 5,000,000 p.a. |
| NHT | 3% | None |
| Education Tax | 3.5% | None |
| HEART (3+ employees) | 3% | None |
| **Total employer on-cost** | **~12.5%** | — |

**Self-employed total**

| Contribution | Self-Employed Rate | Ceiling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NIS | 6% | JMD 5,000,000 p.a. |
| NHT | 3% | None |
| Education Tax | 2.25% | None (on income net of NIS) |
| **Total self-employed statutory** | **~11.25%** (blended; NIS ceiling applies) | — |

Note: The totals are approximate because the NIS ceiling means effective rates fall as income rises above JMD 5,000,000.

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults table**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — do not apply threshold until residency confirmed |
| Unknown pensioner / Golden Ager status | Do not apply additional exemptions |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, home office, phone) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown whether NHT contributions are current | Do not assume deductibility of arrears |
| Unknown GCT registration status | Ask if annual turnover approaches JMD 15,000,000 |
| Dividend income — unknown withholding applied | Treat as 15% WHT already deducted (final for ordinary dividends) |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

- **Minimum viable inputs** — Bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residency status (resident or non-resident) and income source (employed, self-employed, or both).
- **Recommended inputs** — All sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, NIS/NHT/Education Tax payment records, prior year S04 or tax assessment, quarterly S04A payment confirmations, capital allowances schedule (Schedule 2).
- **Ideal inputs** — Complete Profit & Loss Account and Balance Sheet, asset register, all statutory payment receipts, evidence of approved superannuation contributions, any GCT return filed for the year.
- **Refusal if minimum is missing** — SOFT WARN. No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This S04 working paper was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the wholly-and-exclusively test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-JM-1** — Residency status unknown. "Residency determines whether the tax-free threshold applies and whether worldwide income is in scope. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming residency. Please confirm before proceeding."
- **R-JM-2** — Company or partnership structure. "This skill covers sole traders and individuals only. Companies file a corporate income tax return; partnerships file separately. Escalate to a qualified Jamaican tax practitioner."
- **R-JM-3** — Non-resident income from outside Jamaica. "Non-residents are taxed only on Jamaica-source income. Cross-border income sourcing is complex. Escalate to a qualified practitioner."
- **R-JM-4** — Estate or trust income. "Estate and trust taxation is outside the scope of this skill. Escalate to a qualified practitioner."
- **R-JM-5** — Arrears / TAJ enforcement. "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to TAJ enforcement. The 33.33% per annum interest rate on late payments is severe. Do not advise further. Escalate to a qualified practitioner immediately."
- **R-JM-6** — GCT return requested. "This skill covers income tax only (S04, IT01). For Jamaica General Consumption Tax, use the jamaica-gct skill."
- **R-JM-7** — Transfer tax or stamp duty on property. "Transfer tax (1.5% on estate; 15% on real estate transfers) is a transactional tax outside this skill. Escalate to a qualified practitioner."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Employee Below Threshold (All Income Within Tax-Free Band)

**Scenario:** Employee, resident, annual gross salary JMD 1,500,000.

**Bank statement line:**
`15/01/2025 ; NCB CREDIT ; EMPLOYER ABC LTD ; MONTHLY SALARY JAN ; +125,000.00 ; JMD`

**Computation (annual):**
- Gross salary: JMD 1,500,000
- NIS (employee): JMD 1,500,000 x 3% = JMD 45,000 (ceiling JMD 5,000,000 not triggered)
- NHT (employee): JMD 1,500,000 x 2% = JMD 30,000
- Education Tax base: JMD 1,500,000 - JMD 45,000 = JMD 1,455,000; Ed Tax = JMD 1,455,000 x 2.25% = JMD 32,737.50
- Chargeable income for IT: JMD 1,500,000 - JMD 45,000 (NIS deductible) - JMD 1,774,554 (threshold) = negative — threshold exceeds income
- Income tax: JMD 0 (income below threshold)
- **Net take-home:** JMD 1,500,000 - JMD 45,000 - JMD 30,000 - JMD 32,737.50 = **JMD 1,392,262.50**
- Note: Education Tax of JMD 32,737.50 still applies despite income being below the IT threshold — common compliance point.

**Classification:** Statutory deductions apply; IT = nil.

### Example 2 -- Employee Above Threshold, Single Band

**Scenario:** Employee, resident, annual gross salary JMD 2,400,000.

**Computation (annual):**
- Gross salary: JMD 2,400,000
- NIS (employee): JMD 2,400,000 x 3% = JMD 72,000
- NHT (employee): JMD 2,400,000 x 2% = JMD 48,000
- Education Tax base: JMD 2,400,000 - JMD 72,000 = JMD 2,328,000; Ed Tax = JMD 2,328,000 x 2.25% = JMD 52,380
- Chargeable income for IT: JMD 2,400,000 - JMD 72,000 (NIS) - JMD 1,774,554 (threshold) = JMD 553,446
- Income tax: JMD 553,446 x 25% = JMD 138,361.50 (entirely in lower band; JMD 553,446 < JMD 6,000,000)
- **Net take-home:** JMD 2,400,000 - JMD 72,000 - JMD 48,000 - JMD 52,380 - JMD 138,361.50 = **JMD 2,089,258.50**

**Classification:** 25% lower band; all standard contributions apply.

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed, Lower Band

**Scenario:** Sole trader, resident, gross business income JMD 3,500,000, allowable business expenses JMD 400,000 (excluding NIS/NHT/Ed Tax).

**Computation (annual):**
- Gross business income: JMD 3,500,000
- Less: allowable business expenses: JMD 400,000
- Statutory income before contributions: JMD 3,100,000
- NIS (self-employed): JMD 3,500,000 x 6% = JMD 210,000 (ceiling not triggered; JMD 3,500,000 < JMD 5,000,000)
- NHT (self-employed): JMD 3,100,000 (net statutory income after expenses) x 3% = JMD 93,000 [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm NHT base is net statutory income or gross; PwC cites 3% on emoluments; NHT site cites net statutory income for self-employed]
- Education Tax base: JMD 3,500,000 - JMD 210,000 (NIS) = JMD 3,290,000; Ed Tax = JMD 3,290,000 x 2.25% = JMD 74,025
- Chargeable income for IT: JMD 3,500,000 - JMD 400,000 (business expenses) - JMD 210,000 (NIS deductible) - JMD 1,774,554 (threshold) = JMD 1,115,446
- Income tax: JMD 1,115,446 x 25% = JMD 278,861.50 (entirely in lower band)
- **Total statutory payments:** JMD 210,000 + JMD 93,000 + JMD 74,025 + JMD 278,861.50 = JMD 655,886.50
- **Net retained:** JMD 3,500,000 - JMD 400,000 (expenses) - JMD 655,886.50 = **JMD 2,444,113.50**

**Classification:** Lower band; all self-employed contributions apply.

### Example 4 -- Self-Employed, Spanning Both Bands

**Scenario:** Sole trader, resident, gross business income JMD 9,000,000, allowable expenses JMD 500,000.

**Computation (annual):**
- Gross business income: JMD 9,000,000
- Less: allowable business expenses: JMD 500,000
- NIS (self-employed): ceiling applies; JMD 5,000,000 x 6% = JMD 300,000 (maximum)
- Ed Tax base: JMD 9,000,000 - JMD 300,000 = JMD 8,700,000; Ed Tax = JMD 8,700,000 x 2.25% = JMD 195,750
- NHT (self-employed): [RESEARCH GAP — base to be confirmed] approximately JMD 8,500,000 x 3% = JMD 255,000 (illustrative)
- Chargeable income for IT: JMD 9,000,000 - JMD 500,000 (business expenses) - JMD 300,000 (NIS) - JMD 1,774,554 (threshold) = JMD 6,425,446
- IT on lower band (JMD 6,000,000 x 25%): JMD 1,500,000
- IT on upper band (JMD 6,425,446 - JMD 6,000,000 = JMD 425,446 x 30%): JMD 127,633.80
- Total income tax: JMD 1,500,000 + JMD 127,633.80 = **JMD 1,627,633.80**

**Classification:** Spans both bands; upper 30% rate applies to JMD 425,446.

### Example 5 -- Laptop Purchase (Capital Item, Not Immediate Expense)

**Bank statement line:**
`10/06/2025 ; NCB CARD ; BEST BUY ELECTRONICS KINGSTON ; MACBOOK PRO ; -180,000.00 ; JMD`

**Reasoning:**
Capital asset — data processing equipment. Depreciated at 20% per annum straight-line (standard rate) or 40% initial allowance + 33.33%/year under the enhanced 2025--2026 accelerated allowances. Using standard rates: JMD 180,000 x 20% = JMD 36,000 capital allowance in year of purchase. Do NOT put the full JMD 180,000 in deductible expenses.

Under accelerated allowance (for qualifying expenditure 1 Jan 2025 -- 31 Dec 2026): Year 1 allowance = 40% initial = JMD 72,000 (plus standard 20% on remaining JMD 108,000 = JMD 21,600); flag for reviewer to confirm qualification.

**Classification:** Schedule 2 (capital allowances) — standard annual allowance JMD 36,000. NOT a P&L expense.

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Bank statement line:**
`20/03/2025 ; NCB TRANSFER ; OWN SAVINGS ACCOUNT ; PERSONAL SAVINGS ; -500,000.00 ; JMD`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely from S04 computation.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Wholly and Exclusively Test

- **Wholly and exclusively test** — An expense is deductible only if incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned. The apportionment method must be reasonable and documented.  _(Source: Income Tax Act (Jamaica), deductions provisions; PwC Jamaica Deductions — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/deductions)_

### 5.2 Self-Employed — Computation of Chargeable Income

- **Chargeable income formula** — Chargeable income = Gross business income LESS: Wholly and exclusively incurred business expenses LESS: NIS contributions (deductible) LESS: Approved superannuation / pension contributions LESS: Interest on capital employed in earning income LESS: Charitable donations (capped at 5% of taxable income to approved organisations) LESS: Tax-free threshold (JMD 1,774,554 blended for 2025) = Taxable income to which 25%/30% rates are applied  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Deductions.)_
- **NHT and Ed Tax not deductible for self-employed IT base** — NHT and Education Tax are NOT deductible from the income tax base for self-employed persons (NIS is deductible; NHT and Ed Tax are not).  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Deductions.)_

### 5.3 Loss Carry-Forward

- **Loss carry-forward restriction** — Losses are restricted to 50% of chargeable income in the carry-forward year. Exceptions: new businesses (first 5 years) or businesses with turnover under JMD 15,000,000. A sole trader cannot use the threshold to create or enlarge a loss carry-forward.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Deductions.)_

### 5.4 Capital Allowances (Standard Rates — Straight-Line)

**Standard Rates table**  _(Source: EY Tax Alert 2025-0742.)_

| Asset Class | Initial Allowance | Annual Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Industrial buildings (concrete) | 20% | 4%--12.5% |

- **Enhanced rates cross reference** — Enhanced (accelerated) rates available for qualifying expenditure 1 Jan 2025 -- 31 Dec 2026 — see Section 3.7 and Section 6.4.  _(Source: EY Tax Alert 2025-0742.)_

### 5.5 Non-Deductible Expenses

**Non-Deductible Expenses table**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment (client meals, events) | Not wholly and exclusively for business |
| Personal living expenses | Private |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax itself | Tax on income cannot reduce income |
| NHT contributions (self-employed) | Not deductible for IT purposes |

| Charitable donations exceeding 5% of taxable income | Capped |

### 5.6 Income Types and Tax Treatment

**Income Types table**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Income Determination — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/income-determination)_

| Income Type | Tax Treatment |
| --- | --- |

| Employment income | PAYE withholding; threshold applied by employer |
| Rental income | Included in total income on return |

| Ordinary dividends | 15% WHT — final (not included in IT01 if WHT applied) |
| Preference dividends | Included in return at 25%/30% |
| Capital gains | NONE — Jamaica has no capital gains tax on individuals |

### 5.7 Withholding Taxes on Passive Income

**Withholding Taxes table**  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Significant Developments — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/significant-developments; EY Tax Alert 2025-0742.)_

| Payment Type | Resident Rate | Non-Resident Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |

| Preference dividends | 25% / 30% progressive | 25% / 30% |
| Interest (banks/financial) | 25% (credit against IT) | 25% |

- **Non-resident dividend WHT reduction** — Non-resident dividend WHT reduced from 25% to 15% effective 1 April 2025.  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Significant Developments — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/jamaica/individual/significant-developments; EY Tax Alert 2025-0742.)_

### 5.8 Benefits in Kind (Employment)

- **Company car deemed benefit** — Company cars attract a deemed benefit: Benefit value: JMD 30,000 to JMD 140,000 per year depending on cost, age, and usage. Included in employment income and subject to PAYE. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact tiered scale from current TAJ guidelines]  _(Source: PwC Jamaica Income Determination.)_

### 5.9 GCT Registration Threshold

- **GCT registration threshold** — Self-employed persons providing taxable goods or services must register for General Consumption Tax (GCT — Jamaica's VAT equivalent) if annual turnover meets or exceeds JMD 15,000,000 (increased from JMD 10,000,000, effective 1 April 2025). Registration required within 21 days of crossing the threshold. GCT rate: 15% standard. GCT returns and payment due by 25th of each month.  _(Source: JIS — https://jis.gov.jm/gct-exemption-threshold-for-msmes-increased-to-15-million/; VATupdate — https://www.vatupdate.com/2025/03/13/jamaica-raises-gct-registration-threshold-in-2025-26-budget/)_

For GCT computation details, use the jamaica-gct skill.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

- **Home office deduction method** — Calculate the proportion of home used exclusively for business (dedicated room as a percentage of total rooms or floor area). Apply that percentage to rent, electricity, water, internet, and maintenance costs. A dual-use room (kitchen table, living room) does NOT qualify. Conservative default: 0% deduction until reviewer confirms room arrangement and business exclusivity. Flag for reviewer: Confirm room count, floor area basis, and that the workspace is genuinely dedicated and used exclusively for business.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- **Motor vehicle business use rules** — Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible. Client must maintain a mileage log (business trips vs total mileage). For private motor vehicles, the cost is capped at USD 35,000 for capital allowance purposes. Conservative default: 0% business use until mileage log provided. Flag for reviewer: Confirm business percentage is documented, vehicle classification (trade vs private), and USD 35,000 cost cap compliance.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- **Phone/internet mixed use rule** — Business-use portion only. Client must provide a reasonable estimate of business vs personal use. Conservative default: 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Accelerated Capital Allowances (2025--2026)

- **Accelerated capital allowances qualification** — For qualifying capital expenditure between 1 January 2025 and 31 December 2026, enhanced rates apply (see Section 3.7). The asset and expenditure must qualify under the budget measure. Flag for reviewer to confirm qualification before applying enhanced rates.

### 6.5 Approved Superannuation Contributions

- **Approved superannuation contributions rule** — Contributions to an approved superannuation/pension scheme are deductible. The scheme must be approved by the relevant authority. Flag for reviewer: Confirm the scheme is TAJ-approved before deducting.

### 6.6 Bad Debt Write-Off

- **Bad debt write-off conditions** — Deductible only if: (1) the income was previously declared as business income, (2) all reasonable recovery steps have been taken, and (3) the debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag for reviewer: Confirm all three conditions before deducting.

### 6.7 Charitable Donations

- **Charitable donations cap** — Deductible up to 5% of taxable income for approved charitable organisations. Excess is not deductible. Flag for reviewer: Confirm the organisation is approved; confirm cap calculation.

### 6.8 NHT Base for Self-Employed

- **NHT base uncertainty** — PwC cites NHT at 3% for self-employed on emoluments; the NHT official site references "net statutory income." The exact base (gross income, net of expenses, or net of NIS) for self-employed NHT computations requires confirmation. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm NHT base for self-employed from current NHT Act provisions.]

Input: Laptop JMD 180,000 claimed as immediate business expense.
Expected: Remove from P&L deductions. Capital allowance (standard rate 20%) = JMD 36,000 in Schedule 2. Accelerated rate (40% initial for 2025 qualifying spend) = JMD 72,000 — flag for reviewer to confirm qualification.

Input: Non-resident, Jamaica-source business income JMD 2,000,000, no expenses.
Expected: No threshold applies; chargeable income = JMD 2,000,000; IT = JMD 2,000,000 x 25% = JMD 500,000.

Input: Employee, annual gross salary JMD 1,200,000.
Expected: IT = JMD 0 (below threshold); Ed Tax still applies: base = JMD 1,200,000 - NIS; NIS = JMD 1,200,000 x 3% = JMD 36,000; Ed Tax base = JMD 1,164,000; Ed Tax = JMD 1,164,000 x 2.25% = JMD 26,190. Education Tax does NOT have a threshold exemption.
