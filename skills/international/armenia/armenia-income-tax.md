# Armenia Personal Income Tax -- Self-Employed & Individuals Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 -- research-verified.** Figures below were cross-checked mainly via PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (last reviewed 5 Feb 2026) and Vardanyan & Partners (a local Armenian law firm). Numeric schedules were not directly extracted from the State Revenue Committee (src.am) or the ARLIS Tax Code text in this research session. A reviewer must confirm against src.am and the Tax Code of the Republic of Armenia directly. Items flagged **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** are explicitly uncertain.

### Headline rate (2025)

**Armenia levies a single FLAT personal income tax of 20% on employment income, self-employment/business income, and most "other" income.** Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Armenian-source income only. There are **no personal allowances and no progressive brackets** under the flat regime -- PIT is simply 20% of gross taxable income. _Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Taxes on personal income._

### PIT Rate Schedule (2025)

| Income type | Rate | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employment income (general) | 20% (flat) | Single flat rate since 1 Jan 2023 (phased reduction from 23% completed). Withheld monthly by employer. | PwC |
| Business / self-employment income (general regime) | 20% (flat) | Applies absent a valid special-regime election. | PwC |
| Other income (general) | 20% (flat) | Residents worldwide; non-residents Armenian-source. | PwC |
| Dividends | 5% | Withheld at source; refundable if reinvested in the same resident entity in the same tax year. Non-resident treaty rates may differ (5%/10%). | PwC |
| Interest income | 20% | Effective from 1 Jan 2023. | PwC |
| Royalties | 10% | Effective from 1 Jan 2023. | PwC |
| Property lease / rental income | 10% on gross rent | If annual rental income exceeds AMD 60,000,000, an additional 10% applies to the excess **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm; flagged from prior years, not reconfirmed this session]**. | PwC |
| Sale of property (real estate / vehicles) to a tax agent (legal entity / IE) | 10% (or 20% in specific cases) | 10% generally; 20% in certain cases (e.g. building/developer sales). Sales of property **between private individuals are EXEMPT**. | PwC |

> **Note (rate stability):** The flat 20% rate has applied since 1 Jan 2023 and is unchanged for the 2025 tax year. _Source: PwC._

### Special-regime rate map (small business / self-employed)

| Regime | Eligibility ceiling | Rate(s) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| General PIT regime | (default) | 20% flat on net income | PwC |
| Turnover tax | Prior-year sales turnover ≤ AMD 115,000,000 | 5% secondary raw-materials trade / 7% production / 10% trading & other / 1% high-tech / 10% rental, interest, royalties | PwC -- Corporate Other taxes |
| Micro-business (microenterprise) | Annual turnover ≤ AMD 24,000,000 | Broadly EXEMPT from main taxes; fixed reduced employee salary tax ~AMD 5,000/employee/month **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact current amount and post-July-2025 scope]** | Vardanyan & Partners |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency status | Treat as **Armenian tax resident** (worldwide income) -- the broader, more conservative base |
| Unknown regime (general vs turnover vs micro) | **General 20% PIT regime** -- special regimes require a valid, timely election |
| Unknown employee date of birth | Assume born **on/after 1 Jan 1974** -- mandatory funded pension applies |
| Unknown whether stamp duty / health insurance applies | **Include them** in net-pay computations (statutory deductions) |
| Unknown income type | Treat as general income at **20%** |
| Unknown deductibility of a business cost | **Not deductible** until substantiated |
| Unknown VAT registration | Assume the turnover-tax / general boundary at AMD 115,000,000 governs |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- the income figure(s) and income type (employment, self-employment, dividends, interest, royalties, rent, property sale), plus confirmation of residency status and (for payroll) the employee's monthly gross salary and whether born on/after 1 Jan 1974.

**Recommended** -- full bank statement for the tax year in CSV/PDF/pasted text, payroll registers, the prior-year annual declaration or turnover-tax returns, confirmation of any special-regime election (turnover tax / micro-business) and its election date, and the SRC taxpayer registration (TIN / HVHH).

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure records, contracts evidencing income type, funded-pension and health-insurance withholding records, stamp-duty records, and any treaty residence certificate for non-resident or dual-resident situations.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No income figure or income type at all = hard stop. A bank statement without supporting income-type detail = proceed with a reviewer warning: "This Armenian computation was produced from limited data. The reviewer must confirm residency, income type, and any special-regime election before filing."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-AM-1 -- Residency status unknown and material.** "Armenian residency (≥183 days, centre of vital interests, or state service) determines whether worldwide or only Armenian-source income is taxed. Confirm residency before relying on this output for a cross-border taxpayer."

**R-AM-2 -- Companies and partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and individual entrepreneurs (IE) only. Corporate profit tax for legal entities is out of scope. Escalate to an Armenian tax practitioner."

**R-AM-3 -- Treaty / non-resident reduced rates.** "Treaty-reduced rates for non-residents (dividends, interest, royalties) are not enumerated in this skill. Out of scope. Escalate to an Armenian tax practitioner."

**R-AM-4 -- Capital gains / developer property sales.** "Property sales taxed at 20% (e.g. building/developer disposals) and complex capital transactions require specialised analysis. Escalate to an Armenian tax practitioner."

**R-AM-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding Armenian tax arrears or SRC enforcement exposure. Late-payment interest accrues at 0.075%/day. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-AM-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax and the turnover/micro regimes only. Armenian VAT (general regime above AMD 115,000,000 turnover) is a separate workflow. Escalate or use a dedicated VAT skill."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Armenian statements may be in Armenian, Russian, or English; both Armenian-script and transliterated terms are listed. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits on Bank Statement)

| Pattern | Income type | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client name + TRANSFER, VARCUM, ՎՃԱՐՈՒՄ, PAYMENT | Business / self-employment | 20% general PIT (or turnover tax if elected) | Match to invoices; net of VAT if VAT-registered |
| GANDZ, FEES, CONSULTING, ԾԱՌԱՅՈՒԹՅՈՒՆ | Business / self-employment | 20% general PIT | Professional service fees |
| ASHKHATAVARDZ, SALARY, ASHKHATAVARД (ԱՇԽԱՏԱՎԱՐՁ) | Employment income | 20% PIT withheld by employer | Already net if employer withheld -- verify |
| STRIPE PAYOUT, PAYPAL, WISE, UPWORK, FIVERR | Business / self-employment | 20% general PIT | Platform payout -- match to underlying income |
| DIVIDEND, SHAHUTABAZHIN (ՇԱՀՈՒԹԱԲԱԺԻՆ) | Dividends | 5% (refundable if reinvested same year, same entity) | Withheld at source |
| TOKOS, INTEREST, ՏՈԿՈՍ | Interest income | 20% | Effective from 1 Jan 2023 |
| ROYALTY, ARTONAGIN (ԱՐՏՈՆԱԳԻՆ) | Royalties | 10% | |
| VARDZAKALUTYUN, RENT RECEIVED, ՎԱՐՁԱԿԱԼՈՒԹՅՈՒՆ | Property lease / rental | 10% on gross | +10% on excess over AMD 60m/yr **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| SRC REFUND, TAX REFUND, HARKI VERADARDZ | EXCLUDE | Not income | Prior-year refund |
| PROPERTY SALE TO ENTITY/IE | Property sale | 10% (or 20% certain cases) | Sale between private individuals = EXEMPT |

### 3.2 Expense / Deduction Patterns (Debits) -- relevant to IE / self-employed under general regime

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| GRASENYAKI VARDZ, OFFICE RENT | Office rent | Deductible (general regime) | Dedicated business premises |
| HASHVAPAH, ACCOUNTANT, AUDIT | Accountancy fees | Deductible | |
| IRAVABAN, LAWYER, LEGAL, NOTARY | Legal fees | Deductible | Business-related only |
| GRASENYAKAYIN, OFFICE SUPPLIES, STATIONERY | Office supplies | Deductible | |
| MARKETING, GOOGLE ADS, META ADS, FACEBOOK | Marketing/advertising | Deductible | |
| GOOGLE WORKSPACE, MICROSOFT 365, ADOBE, ANTHROPIC, OPENAI, GITHUB | Software subscription | Deductible | Recurring operating expense |
| BANK CHARGE, MIJNORDAVCAR, SPASARKUM | Bank charges | Deductible | Business account |
| STRIPE FEE, PAYPAL FEE | Payment processing | Deductible | |

> **Important:** Under the **turnover-tax** and **micro-business** regimes, tax is computed on **gross turnover**, NOT on net profit -- expense deductions in 3.2 are largely irrelevant there. Only the general 20% regime is profit-based.

### 3.3 Statutory Payroll Deductions (Debits / withholdings) -- NOT business expenses

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| PIT WITHHOLDING, ANHATAKAN HARK | PIT | 20% withheld monthly, remitted by 20th of following month | Employer = tax agent |
| KENSAPOZH, FUNDED PENSION, PENSION CONTRIBUTION | Funded pension | See Section 5.4 formula | Employee withholding + state co-financing |
| STAMP DUTY, DEFENCE STAMP, NTAGOSGHARI | Stamp (military/defence) duty | AMD 1,000 or AMD 15,000/month (Dec 2025) | Tiered by gross salary |
| HEALTH INSURANCE, ARJOGHJUTYAN APAHOVAGRUTYUN | Health insurance contribution | AMD 4,800 or AMD 10,800/month reference premium (from 2026; net is state-subsidised — see §5.7) | Employees earning > AMD 200,000/month |

### 3.4 Exclusions (Neither Income nor Deductible Expense)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INTERNAL TRANSFER, OWN ACCOUNT, SEPAKAN HASHIV | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| LOAN, VARK, REPAYMENT | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |
| VAT PAYMENT, AAH (ԱԱՀ) | EXCLUDE | VAT liability payment, not an expense |
| TAX PAYMENT, HARKI VCHARUM | EXCLUDE | Income tax itself is not deductible |
| DRAWINGS, PERSONAL WITHDRAWAL, ATM (personal) | EXCLUDE | Not an expense |

### 3.5 Armenian Banks -- Statement Format Reference

| Bank | Common Patterns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ameriabank | TRANSFER, PAYMENT, FEE, CARD | PDF/CSV; English + Armenian descriptions |
| Ardshinbank | VARCUM, SPASARKUM, KARTI | PDF; Armenian-script descriptions common |
| Acba Bank | TRANSFER, COMMISSION, DD | PDF/CSV |
| Inecobank | PAYMENT, TRANSFER, FEE | CSV available; clean counterparty names |
| Converse Bank | VARCUM, TOKOS, SPASARKUM | PDF; mixed Armenian/English |

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

> All figures recomputed end-to-end. Rates per PwC / Vardanyan & Partners as cited in Section 1.

### Example 1 -- Employee, monthly gross AMD 400,000 (below pension 500k threshold)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; AMERIABANK ; EMPLOYER LLC ; ASHKHATAVARDZ MARCH ; +400,000.00 ; AMD`

**Reasoning (monthly):**
- PIT: 20% × 400,000 = **AMD 80,000**
- Funded pension: gross < 500,000 → 5% × 400,000 = **AMD 20,000**
- Stamp (defence) duty: gross ≤ 1,000,000 → **AMD 1,000**
- Health insurance: gross > 200,000 and ≤ 500,000 → **AMD 4,800** reference premium (from 2026; actual net likely ~AMD 300 after state subsidy — see §5.7)
- Net pay (using reference premium) = 400,000 − 80,000 − 20,000 − 1,000 − 4,800 = **AMD 294,200** _(net is higher if the ~AMD 300 subsidised figure applies — reviewer to confirm)_

**Classification:** Employment income, flat 20% PIT, pension 5% tier, lowest stamp/health tier.

### Example 2 -- Employee, monthly gross AMD 600,000 (above pension 500k threshold)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; INECOBANK ; EMPLOYER LLC ; SALARY MARCH ; +600,000.00 ; AMD`

**Reasoning (monthly):**
- PIT: 20% × 600,000 = **AMD 120,000**
- Funded pension: gross ≥ 500,000 → 10% × 600,000 − 25,000 = 60,000 − 25,000 = **AMD 35,000**
- Stamp duty: gross ≤ 1,000,000 → **AMD 1,000**
- Health insurance: gross ≥ 500,001 → **AMD 10,800**
- Net pay = 600,000 − 120,000 − 35,000 − 1,000 − 10,800 = **AMD 433,200**

**Classification:** Employment income, 10%-minus-25,000 pension tier, top stamp/health tier above 500,001.

### Example 3 -- Employee, monthly gross AMD 1,200,000 (above pension base cap)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; ARDSHINBANK ; EMPLOYER LLC ; SALARY MARCH ; +1,200,000.00 ; AMD`

**Reasoning (monthly):**
- PIT: 20% × 1,200,000 = **AMD 240,000**
- Funded pension: base capped at AMD 1,125,000 → 10% × 1,125,000 − 25,000 = 112,500 − 25,000 = **AMD 87,500** (the statutory maximum)
- Stamp duty: gross > 1,000,001 → **AMD 15,000**
- Health insurance: gross ≥ 500,001 → **AMD 10,800**
- Net pay = 1,200,000 − 240,000 − 87,500 − 15,000 − 10,800 = **AMD 846,700**

**Classification:** Employment income at the pension contribution ceiling; max funded-pension AMD 87,500/month confirmed.

### Example 4 -- Individual Entrepreneur, general regime, annual income AMD 10,000,000

**Input:** IE NOT under a special regime (e.g. excluded professional service), annual gross income AMD 10,000,000.

**Reasoning (annual):**
- General PIT: 20% × 10,000,000 = **AMD 2,000,000** _(applied to taxable income; assume no allowable deductions here for illustration)_
- Funded pension (IE): income > 6,000,000 → 10% × 10,000,000 − 300,000 = 1,000,000 − 300,000 = **AMD 700,000**
- Health insurance (IE): income > 2,400,001 → flat **AMD 129,600**
- Net after statutory levies = 10,000,000 − 2,000,000 − 700,000 − 129,600 = **AMD 7,170,400**

**Classification:** General-regime IE; pension 10%-minus-300,000 tier; IE health-insurance flat charge applies.

### Example 5 -- Turnover-tax IE (trading), quarterly turnover AMD 5,000,000

**Input:** IE under turnover-tax regime (prior-year sales ≤ AMD 115,000,000), trading activity, quarterly turnover AMD 5,000,000.

**Reasoning:**
- Turnover tax (trading & other): 10% × 5,000,000 = **AMD 500,000** for the quarter
- Computed on gross turnover -- no expense deductions
- Quarterly filing; pay within 20 days of period end

**Classification:** Turnover tax 10% trading rate. Note funded-pension and (where applicable) IE health-insurance contributions still apply separately per Section 5.

### Example 6 -- Dividend received

**Input line:**
`20/04/2025 ; CONVERSE BANK ; RESIDENT CO LLC ; SHAHUTABAZHIN ; +1,000,000.00 ; AMD`

**Reasoning:**
- Dividend: 5% × 1,000,000 = **AMD 50,000** withheld at source.
- Refundable if reinvested in the **same resident entity in the same tax year**.

**Classification:** Schedular 5% dividend rate. Flag reinvestment-refund eligibility for reviewer.

### Example 7 -- Property sale between private individuals (EXEMPT)

**Input line:**
`12/05/2025 ; AMERIABANK ; PRIVATE BUYER ; APARTMENT SALE ; +45,000,000.00 ; AMD`

**Reasoning:**
- Sale of real estate **between private individuals is EXEMPT** from PIT.
- (Contrast: sale to a tax agent / legal entity / IE would be 10%, or 20% in developer/building cases.)

**Classification:** EXEMPT. No PIT. Confirm the buyer is a private individual, not a tax agent.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Flat PIT Rate

**Legislation:** Tax Code of Armenia (HO-165-N). _Source: PwC._

PIT is a single flat **20%** on employment income, self-employment/business income (general regime), and most other income. There are **no personal allowances and no progressive brackets**. Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Armenian-source income only.

### 5.2 Residency Tests

**Legislation:** Tax Code; _Source: PwC -- Residence._

An individual is an Armenian tax resident if ANY of the following holds:
- **≥183 days** physical presence in Armenia during the tax year (1 Jan -- 31 Dec); OR
- **Centre of vital interests** is in Armenia; OR
- The individual is in **Armenian civil / state service**.

Default to resident treatment when status is unknown (Section 1).

### 5.3 Schedular Rates

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends | 5% (refundable if reinvested same year, same resident entity) | PwC |
| Interest | 20% | PwC |
| Royalties | 10% | PwC |
| Property lease / rental | 10% on gross (+10% on excess over AMD 60m/yr **[RESEARCH GAP]**) | PwC |
| Sale of property to a tax agent | 10% (or 20% in certain cases); private-to-private EXEMPT | PwC |

### 5.4 Mandatory Funded Pension Contribution

**Legislation:** Law on Funded Pensions. _Source: PwC -- Other taxes._ Mandatory for employees **born on/after 1 Jan 1974**; the State co-finances the remainder from the budget.

**Employee (monthly gross salary):**
- If gross **< AMD 500,000**: contribution = **5% × gross**
- If gross **≥ AMD 500,000**: contribution = **10% × gross − AMD 25,000**
- **Base capped at AMD 1,125,000/month** (= 15 × minimum monthly salary of AMD 75,000), giving a **maximum employee contribution of AMD 87,500/month**.

Arithmetic check at cap: 10% × 1,125,000 − 25,000 = 112,500 − 25,000 = **87,500** ✓

**Individual entrepreneur (annual gross income):**
- If income **≤ AMD 6,000,000**: contribution = **5% × income**
- If income **> AMD 6,000,000**: contribution = **10% × income − AMD 300,000**
- Aligned to the AMD 1,125,000/month base cap (= AMD 13,500,000/year), giving the same annual maximum AMD 1,050,000 (= 87,500 × 12). _Source: PwC._

### 5.5 Employer Social Security Contributions -- NONE

Private-sector employers in Armenia pay **NO separate social security contribution**. The only worker-side mandatory levies are the employee funded pension (with state co-financing), the stamp/defence duty, and the health-insurance contribution. _Source: Vardanyan & Partners -- Payroll guide._

### 5.6 Stamp (Military / Defence) Duty on Salaries

**Effective Dec 2025.** _Source: PwC -- Other taxes._

| Monthly gross | Stamp duty |
|---|---|
| Up to AMD 1,000,000 | AMD 1,000/month |
| Above AMD 1,000,001 | AMD 15,000/month |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** The schedule above AMD 1,000,001 is likely graduated to higher fixed amounts for very high salaries; only two tiers were captured this session.

### 5.7 Mandatory Health Insurance Contribution

**Law "On Universal Health Insurance" was adopted December 2025; contributions apply from 2026 (NOT from 25 Dec 2025).** Mandatory only for employees with monthly gross **> AMD 200,000**. The full reference premium is **AMD 129,600/year (≈ AMD 10,800/month)** per adult. _Sources: PwC -- Other taxes; armenian-lawyer.com; profin.am._

| Monthly gross | Reference premium tier (per PwC) |
|---|---|
| AMD 200,001 -- 500,000 | AMD 4,800/month |
| ≥ AMD 500,001 | AMD 10,800/month |

**Individual entrepreneurs:** flat **AMD 129,600 annually**, if annual gross income > AMD 2,400,001. _Source: PwC._

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm — MATERIAL]** Two issues a reviewer MUST resolve before relying on the net-pay figures below:
> 1. **Timing:** contributions run from **2026**, not 25 Dec 2025 (that is the law's adoption, not the contribution start). Any "eff. 25 Dec 2025" tag elsewhere in this skill means "from 2026 under the Dec-2025 law."
> 2. **State subsidy:** the AMD 4,800 / 10,800 figures are the *reference premium* tiers. The scheme is heavily state-subsidized, so the employee's actual **net** deduction is much lower — one source indicates only **~AMD 300/month** for the AMD 200,001–500,000 band. The worked examples below use the gross premium tiers and therefore likely OVERSTATE the net deduction; confirm the in-force subsidy schedule against src.am before use.

### 5.8 Minimum Monthly Wage

**AMD 75,000/month**, effective since 1 Jan 2023, unchanged through 2025-2026. _Source: Armenpress._ (Drives the AMD 1,125,000 = 15 × 75,000 pension base cap.)

### 5.9 Turnover Tax Regime (Small Business / Self-Employed)

**Eligibility:** prior-year sales turnover **≤ AMD 115,000,000**. _Source: PwC -- Corporate Other taxes._

| Activity | Rate |
|---|---|
| Secondary raw-materials trade | 5% |
| Production | 7% |
| Trading & other | 10% |
| High-tech | 1% |
| Rental, interest, royalties | 10% |

Computed on **gross turnover** (no profit deductions). Quarterly filing; pay within 20 days of period end. Crossing AMD 115,000,000 moves the taxpayer into the **general VAT regime** (the VAT registration threshold is the same AMD 115,000,000). _Source: PwC._

### 5.10 Micro-Business (Microenterprise) Regime

**Eligibility:** annual turnover **≤ AMD 24,000,000**. _Source: Vardanyan & Partners._

- Broadly **EXEMPT** from main taxes.
- Salaries paid to employees still bear a **fixed reduced income tax of ~AMD 5,000/employee/month** **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact current amount and whether it still applies after the July 2025 exclusions]**.
- Many professional / B2B services (consulting, IT, legal, accounting, advertising, medicine) have been **EXCLUDED** since July 2025.
- Election by **20 February** of the tax year (existing businesses); within 20 days of registration (new businesses). _Source: Vardanyan & Partners._

### 5.11 PIT Withholding and Remittance

Employers (tax agents) withhold flat **20% PIT monthly** from employment income and remit to the State Budget by the **20th day of the following month**, together with funded-pension, stamp-duty, and health-insurance amounts. Where supporting documentation is lacking, tax agents withhold at 20%. _Source: PwC -- Tax administration._

### 5.12 Non-Deductible / Excluded Items (general regime IE)

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| VAT collected / paid (registered) | Liability movement, not income/expense |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Personal living costs | Not business-related |
| Loan principal | Capital movement |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Residency Determination (cross-border)

- ≥183-day count, centre-of-vital-interests, and state-service tests can conflict, especially for dual-resident or recently-arrived individuals.
- **Conservative default:** resident (worldwide income). **Flag for reviewer:** day-count records, treaty tie-breakers, residence certificate.

### 6.2 Dividend Reinvestment Refund

- 5% dividend tax is **refundable if reinvested in the same resident entity in the same tax year**.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the reinvestment occurred, into the same entity, within the same tax year, with documentation.

### 6.3 Property Sale Characterisation

- 10% to a tax agent vs 20% for developer/building sales vs EXEMPT between private individuals.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm buyer status (private vs tax agent) and whether the seller is a developer.

### 6.4 Rental Income Excess Surcharge

- Additional 10% on annual rental income over AMD 60,000,000 is **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]**.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm whether the surcharge is in force for TY2025 and its base.

### 6.5 Regime Election Eligibility (turnover / micro)

- Eligibility depends on prior-year turnover, activity type (post-July-2025 professional-service exclusions), and a timely election.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm a valid, timely election exists and the activity is eligible; otherwise default to general 20%.

5. Present the following questions to the client:

```
ONBOARDING QUESTIONS -- ARMENIA INCOME TAX

   interests here, or in Armenian state service?)
2. What is your income type: employment, self-employment (IE), dividends,
   interest, royalties, rent, or property sale?
3. If self-employed: are you under a special regime (turnover tax or
   micro-business)? When did you elect it?
4. If employed: what is your monthly gross salary, and were you born on or
   after 1 January 1974?
5. Did you receive any foreign-source income (you may need to file an annual
   declaration)?
6. Any property sales? Was the buyer a private individual or a company/IE?
7. Any dividends you reinvested in the same company in the same year?

- NEVER omit the funded-pension contribution for an employee born on/after 1 Jan 1974
- NEVER use the 5% pension tier above AMD 500,000 gross -- switch to 10% minus AMD 25,000, capped at AMD 87,500/month

- NEVER tax a property sale between private individuals -- it is EXEMPT
- NEVER apply turnover-tax or micro-business rates without a confirmed, timely regime election
- NEVER treat turnover-tax / micro-business as profit-based -- they are computed on gross turnover

- NEVER omit stamp duty or (from 2026) the health-insurance contribution from net-pay computations
- NEVER present an unflagged figure that is marked [RESEARCH GAP] as final -- escalate to a reviewer
