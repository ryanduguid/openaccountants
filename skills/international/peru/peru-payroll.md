**Read this whole section before computing anything. The shared payroll runbook lives in `payroll-workflow-base` — follow that runbook with this skill supplying the Peru-specific content.**

### The single most important Peru facts

> **Peru DOES have a personal income tax on employment income** ("renta de quinta categoría"), withheld at source monthly by the employer. The first **7 UIT (S/ 38,500 for 2026)** of annual employment income are exempt; the excess is taxed on a progressive **8% / 14% / 17% / 20% / 30%** schedule. (PwC; TUO LIR)

> **The pension is employee-borne and the employee chooses ONE system**: public **ONP/SNP at 13%**, or a private **AFP** (≈12.5%–13% total: 10% mandatory + 1.37% insurance prima + a per-AFP commission). The employer **withholds** the pension; the employer's only contribution on top of salary is **EsSalud at 9%** (health). (PwC; SBS; ONP)

---

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Renta de Quinta Categoría)

The employer projects the employee's annual fifth-category remuneration, subtracts the 7 UIT exemption, applies the progressive schedule, and withholds the result in monthly installments declared through PLAME. (PwC; TUO LIR Art. 40–46)

### Reference unit — UIT (Unidad Impositiva Tributaria)

The brackets are defined in UIT, so the UIT value is load-bearing.

| Tax year | UIT | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2026 | **S/ 5,500** | PwC (confirmed) |
| 2025 | S/ 5,350 | secondary summaries **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm against the SUNAT/MEF Supreme Decree]** |

All worked examples below use the confirmed **UIT 2026 = S/ 5,500**. (PwC)

### Standard and additional deductions

| Deduction | Amount | Notes / source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard fixed deduction | **7 UIT** = 7 × 5,500 = **S/ 38,500** (2026) | First 7 UIT of annual employment income exempt (PwC; TUO LIR Art. 46) |
| Additional deduction (qualifying expenses) | **Up to 3 UIT** = up to S/ 16,500 (2026) | Property lease, independent professional services, hotels, restaurants, etc., subject to requirements (PwC; TUO LIR Art. 46) |

> The additional **3 UIT** deduction requires documentary support and qualifying expense categories; the employer does not apply it at source by default — it is reconciled by the taxpayer. Default it to **S/ 0** at the withholding stage unless the employee has filed the qualifying support (see Conservative Defaults).

### Progressive Brackets — Domiciled Employment Income (2026)

Applied to **net annual taxable income = projected annual remuneration − 7 UIT** (and minus any confirmed additional deduction).

| Band | Net taxable income (UIT) | Net taxable income (S/, 2026) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at the top of the band (S/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Up to 5 UIT | 0 – 27,500 | 8% | 2,200.00 |
| 2 | Over 5 to 20 UIT | 27,500 – 110,000 | 14% | 13,750.00 |
| 3 | Over 20 to 35 UIT | 110,000 – 192,500 | 17% | 27,775.00 |
| 4 | Over 35 to 45 UIT | 192,500 – 247,500 | 20% | 38,775.00 |
| 5 | Over 45 UIT | Over 247,500 | 30% | — |

(PwC — taxes on personal income; TUO LIR Art. 53) Cumulative-tax check (recomputed):
- Band 1 top: 27,500 × 8% = **2,200.00** ✓
- Band 2 top: 2,200 + (110,000 − 27,500) × 14% = 2,200 + 82,500 × 14% = 2,200 + 11,550 = **13,750.00** ✓
- Band 3 top: 13,750 + (192,500 − 110,000) × 17% = 13,750 + 82,500 × 17% = 13,750 + 14,025 = **27,775.00** ✓
- Band 4 top: 27,775 + (247,500 − 192,500) × 20% = 27,775 + 55,000 × 20% = 27,775 + 11,000 = **38,775.00** ✓

### Non-Domiciled Employment Income

| Income type | Withholding | Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salaries/wages to non-domiciled employees | **30% flat** | Gross Peruvian-source income, **no deductions**, no 7 UIT exemption | PwC — TUO LIR |

### Monthly Withholding Method (domiciled)

The deterministic order is:

1. Start with **projected annual remuneration** (ordinary monthly salary across the year; in practice Peru also pays **two gratificaciones** — see the note below — which are taxable fifth-category income).
2. Subtract the **7 UIT** standard exemption (S/ 38,500 for 2026).
3. Subtract any **confirmed additional deduction** (up to 3 UIT; default S/ 0 at source).
4. The result is the **net annual taxable income**.
5. Apply the progressive schedule → **annual income tax**.
6. Distribute the annual tax across the remaining periods per SUNAT's installment method → **monthly withholding**, with a year-end adjustment.

(PwC; TUO LIR; SUNAT)

> **Gratificaciones note.** Peruvian law grants two statutory gratificaciones per year (July and December), each ≈ one month's salary, which **are** taxable fifth-category income — so a real annual projection commonly uses ~14 months, not 12. To keep the arithmetic transparent and within the researched dataset, the worked examples below project on **12 months only** and flag this; a reviewer should add the gratificaciones (and the related 9% bonificación extraordinaria paid in lieu of EsSalud on gratificaciones) to the projection. **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm the exact gratificación projection mechanics and timing.]**

---

## Section 3 -- Contributions: Employee Deductions (Pension — ONP or AFP)

The employee pays a **pension contribution, withheld from salary**, into exactly **one** system. The employer contributes **nothing** to the pension on top — pensions are entirely employee-borne. (PwC; SBS; ONP)

### Option A — ONP / SNP (public, defined-benefit)

| Contribution | Rate | Payer | Authority | Base / cap | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ONP / SNP | **13%** | Employee (withheld) | ONP | Monthly remuneration; **no cap** | PwC; ONP |

### Option B — AFP (private, individual accounts)

Three employee-borne components, **all withheld from the employee** (employer pays nothing additional). Rates per the **SBS official table, devengue 2026-06** (current snapshot).

| AFP | Mandatory contribution | Insurance prima | Commission on flow (mixed) | Annual commission on balance |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HABITAT | 10.00% | 1.37% | 1.47% | 1.25% |
| INTEGRA | 10.00% | 1.37% | 1.55% | 0.78% |
| PRIMA | 10.00% | 1.37% | 1.60% | 1.25% |
| PROFUTURO | 10.00% | 1.37% | 1.69% | 0.68% |

(SBS — Comisiones y Prima del SPP, devengue 2026-06)

- **Mandatory contribution: 10.00%** of gross salary, to the worker's individual account (uniform across AFPs; no cap). (SBS)
- **Insurance prima (prima de seguro — invalidez/sobrevivencia): 1.37%** (uniform), capped on the **maximum insurable remuneration (RMA) = S/ 12,598.91** for the Apr–Jun 2026 quarter; the RMA is reset quarterly by SBS. (SBS) **[RESEARCH GAP — pull the live RMA at publication time.]**
- **Commission** varies by AFP (and by scheme — flow vs. mixed); the table shows the "comisión sobre flujo (mixta)" leg. Total AFP withholding ≈ **12.5%–13%**.

> **AFP-total range check (recomputed):** lowest = 10.00% + 1.37% + 1.47% (HABITAT flow) = **12.84%**; highest = 10.00% + 1.37% + 1.69% (PROFUTURO flow) = **13.06%**. The ≈12.5%–13% range in the research holds when the prima is RMA-capped on higher salaries (the prima leg falls below 1.37% of gross above the RMA). (SBS)

> **No employee EsSalud contribution.** Health (EsSalud) is **employer-borne** — see Section 4. The employee's only payroll deduction besides income tax is the pension.

---

## Section 4 -- Contributions: Employer Contributions (EsSalud)

The employer's only payroll contribution on top of salary is **EsSalud (health)**. (PwC; EsSalud)

| Contribution | Rate | Authority | Base / cap | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EsSalud (health) | **9%** | EsSalud | Monthly remuneration; **no upper cap**; **minimum base = 1 RMV** | PwC; EsSalud |

- Borne entirely by the **employer** — never deducted from the employee. (PwC)
- **No upper ceiling.** (PwC)
- **Minimum base:** the EsSalud base may not be less than the minimum wage (RMV); EsSalud is computed on at least 1 RMV even where a part-time worker earns less. **[RESEARCH GAP — the RMV-floor rule is a general labour rule; confirm the exact regulatory cite.]**
- **EPS credit:** up to **25%** of EPS (private health-plan) payments may be credited against EsSalud. (PwC)
- Declared/paid via **PLAME (Formulario Virtual N° 601)**. (SUNAT)

### Employer-side wedge summary

| Component | Employee | Employer | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| EsSalud (health) | — | 9% | PwC; EsSalud |
| Pension (ONP 13% **or** AFP ≈12.84%–13.06%) | withheld from employee | — | PwC; SBS; ONP |
| Income tax (5th cat.) | withheld from employee | — | PwC |
| **Net employer-borne add-on over salary** | — | **≈ 9% (EsSalud)** | (pension + income tax are employee withholdings) |

> **Tax treatment / scope:** beyond EsSalud, employers also owe statutory benefits **not covered by this withholding/contribution skill** — CTS (compensación por tiempo de servicios), two gratificaciones per year, and vacation. These are flagged **out of scope** here and must be provisioned separately. **[RESEARCH GAP — CTS/gratificación/vacation accrual mechanics not in this dataset.]**

---

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage (RMV) and Working Hours

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| RMV (Remuneración Mínima Vital) | **S/ 1,130 / month**, effective **1 January 2025** (up from S/ 1,025) | Supreme Decree 006-2024-TR (Presidencia; Garrigues) |
| Hourly equivalent | ≈ S/ 5.17 (48-hour week) | Garrigues **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm exact statutory hourly derivation]** |

The RMV floors the EsSalud base and many statutory benefit computations. (Presidencia; Garrigues)

### Working Hours and Overtime

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Statutory overtime multipliers, the maximum daily/weekly hours, and night/Sunday/holiday premiums under Peruvian labour law were not part of this research dataset. A reviewer should populate these before relying on overtime figures.

---

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is unknown, the skill MUST apply the conservative default below and flag the assumption in its output rather than guessing a more favourable figure.

| Field | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Additional deduction (up to 3 UIT) | **S/ 0 at source** | Requires qualifying-expense documentation; not applied by the employer at withholding stage. (PwC; TUO LIR) |
| Domicile status | **Domiciled** (progressive 8%–30% with 7 UIT exemption) | Apply the 30% non-domiciled flat rate only when non-domicile is confirmed. |
| Pension system | **Confirm with the employee** — do NOT assume ONP vs AFP; if unknown, flag and request it | ONP (13%) and AFP (≈12.84%–13.06%) differ; the choice is the employee's and must be on record. |
| AFP commission scheme | **Use the per-AFP "comisión sobre flujo (mixta)" from the SBS table for the current devengue** | Commission varies by AFP; default to the live SBS figure, not an average. |
| AFP prima base | **min(remuneration, RMA)** | The prima is capped at the RMA (S/ 12,598.91, Q2 2026); never apply 1.37% to remuneration above the RMA. |
| UIT | **S/ 5,500 (2026)** | Confirmed; for 2025 runs confirm UIT against the SUNAT/MEF Supreme Decree. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| EsSalud base | **max(remuneration, 1 RMV)** | EsSalud floored at the minimum wage. **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm cite]** |
| Gratificaciones in the projection | **Project on 12 months and flag** | The 14-month reality (2 gratificaciones) is out of the clean dataset; reviewer to add. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Employer cost estimate | **Salary × 1.09 (add 9% EsSalud)** plus separately-provisioned CTS / gratificaciones / vacation | EsSalud is the only on-top payroll contribution; other benefits are out of scope. |

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before any computation

1. **Monthly base salary** (remuneración) in PEN.
2. **Domicile status** — domiciled (progressive) vs non-domiciled (30% flat on gross).
3. **Pension system** — ONP/SNP (13%) **or** AFP (which of HABITAT / INTEGRA / PRIMA / PROFUTURO, and flow vs. mixed scheme).
4. **Pay period (month and year)** — to pick the correct UIT, RMV, and SBS AFP devengue.
5. **Additional 3 UIT deduction** — whether qualifying expenses are documented (default S/ 0 at source).
6. Whether **gratificaciones** fall in the period — to include them in the projection (currently flagged out of scope).

### Refusal Catalogue — DO NOT attempt; route to a licensed accountant

| Scenario | Why it is out of scope |
|---|---|
| Cross-border / posted workers / totalization (social-security coordination) | Requires treaty / EsSalud/ONP determination — see `cross-border-payroll-coordination`. |
| Double-tax-treaty relief, expat tax-equalisation, tie-breaker domicile | Beyond a domestic payroll run; route to a reviewer. |
| CTS, gratificaciones, and vacation accrual / payout computation | Statutory benefits out of scope for this withholding/contribution skill. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Benefits in kind / company cars / stock-option valuation | Peruvian BIK valuation rules were not in this research dataset. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Severance / indemnización por despido taxation | Not in scope; route to a reviewer. |
| Self-employed / fourth-category (renta de cuarta) regimes | Different regime (independent professional services) — out of scope for employer payroll. |
| The 3 UIT additional deduction reconciliation | Taxpayer-level, documentation-dependent; not applied by the employer at source. |
| Overtime / night / Sunday / holiday premiums and maximum hours | Not in this research dataset. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |

## Section 8 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic classification of Peruvian bank-statement lines for payroll. Match on the uppercased description fragment.

### Salary credits (what lands in the employee's account)

| Bank statement text (ES / EN) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SUELDO`, `REMUNERACION`, `PLANILLA`, `PAGO PLANILLA` | Net salary payment |
| `NOMINA`, `PAYROLL`, `SALARY`, `HABERES` | Net salary payment (variant) |
| `ADELANTO`, `ADELANTO DE SUELDO` | Salary advance (not final pay) |
| `GRATIFICACION`, `GRATI` | Statutory gratificación (July / December) |
| `CTS`, `DEPOSITO CTS` | CTS deposit (out of scope here) |
| `DEVOLUCION RENTA`, `REINTEGRO SUNAT` | Income-tax refund — NOT income |

### Employer debits (what leaves the employer's account)

| Bank statement text (ES / EN) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SUNAT`, `PLAME`, `FORM 601`, `RENTA QUINTA`, `RETENCION RENTA` | Income-tax (5th cat.) + EsSalud/ONP remittance to SUNAT via PLAME |
| `ESSALUD`, `APORTE ESSALUD` | EsSalud 9% employer contribution (via PLAME) |
| `ONP`, `SNP`, `APORTE ONP` | ONP 13% (withheld employee pension) remittance |
| `AFP`, `INTEGRA`, `PRIMA AFP`, `PROFUTURO`, `HABITAT`, `AFPNET` | AFP contribution/commission/prima remittance (withheld) |
| `PAGO PLANILLA`, `NOMINA`, `PAYROLL RUN` | Net wages disbursed to employees |

> Income tax (5th cat.), EsSalud (9%), and ONP (13%) are declared together through **PLAME (Formulario 601)** to SUNAT; AFP amounts are reported in PLAME and paid to the AFP (commonly via AFPnet) within the first **5 business days** of the following month. (SUNAT; SBS)

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All examples use **2026** figures (UIT S/ 5,500; 7 UIT exemption S/ 38,500), domiciled status, the **additional 3 UIT deduction defaulted to S/ 0**, and a **12-month projection** (gratificaciones excluded — flagged). Income tax uses the 8%–30% schedule from Section 2. Every line below was recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 — Low earner, S/ 3,000/month, ONP affiliate

Bank statement context: `PLANILLA … S/ 2,610.00` credited to the employee; `APORTE ONP … S/ 390.00`, `APORTE ESSALUD … S/ 270.00` debited from the employer.

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| Annual remuneration (12 months) | 3,000 × 12 | 36,000.00 |
| Less 7 UIT exemption | — | 38,500.00 |
| Net annual taxable income | max(36,000 − 38,500, 0) | 0.00 |
| Annual income tax | base is 0 | 0.00 |
| Monthly income tax | — | 0.00 |
| ONP pension (13% × 3,000) | monthly, withheld | 390.00 |
| **Net monthly salary** | 3,000 − 390 − 0 | **2,610.00** |
| EsSalud (employer, 9% × 3,000) | on top — not deducted | 270.00 |

> The 7 UIT exemption alone wipes out the income-tax base at S/ 36,000/year. The employer separately pays EsSalud S/ 270.

### Example 2 — Mid earner, S/ 8,000/month, ONP affiliate

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| Annual remuneration (12 months) | 8,000 × 12 | 96,000.00 |
| Less 7 UIT exemption | — | 38,500.00 |
| Net annual taxable income | 96,000 − 38,500 | 57,500.00 |
| Band placement | 57,500 / 5,500 = 10.45 UIT → Band 2 (5–20 UIT) | — |
| Income tax — Band 1 (5 UIT × 8%) | 27,500 × 8% | 2,200.00 |
| Income tax — Band 2 (14% × excess over 27,500) | (57,500 − 27,500) × 14% | 4,200.00 |
| Annual income tax | 2,200 + 4,200 | 6,400.00 |
| Monthly income tax | 6,400 ÷ 12 | 533.33 |
| ONP pension (13% × 8,000) | monthly, withheld | 1,040.00 |
| **Net monthly salary** | 8,000 − 1,040 − 533.33 | **6,426.67** |
| EsSalud (employer, 9% × 8,000) | on top | 720.00 |

### Example 3 — Mid earner, S/ 8,000/month, AFP INTEGRA (mixed/flow scheme)

Same income tax as Example 2 (S/ 533.33/month). Pension switches to AFP. Salary S/ 8,000 < RMA S/ 12,598.91, so the prima applies to the full salary.

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| AFP mandatory (10% × 8,000) | individual account | 800.00 |
| AFP insurance prima (1.37% × min(8,000, 12,598.91)) | 1.37% × 8,000 | 109.60 |
| AFP commission — INTEGRA flow (1.55% × 8,000) | 1.55% × 8,000 | 124.00 |
| Total AFP withholding | 800 + 109.60 + 124.00 | 1,033.60 |
| Monthly income tax | (from Example 2) | 533.33 |
| **Net monthly salary** | 8,000 − 1,033.60 − 533.33 | **6,433.07** |
| EsSalud (employer, 9% × 8,000) | on top | 720.00 |

> AFP total = 12.92% of S/ 8,000 = S/ 1,033.60 (verify: 0.10 + 0.0137 + 0.0155 = 0.1292; 0.1292 × 8,000 = 1,033.60 ✓). Net is S/ 6.40 higher than the ONP equivalent (Example 2) here purely because INTEGRA's effective AFP rate (12.92%) is just below ONP's flat 13%.

### Example 4 — High earner, S/ 20,000/month, AFP PROFUTURO (flow scheme)

Salary S/ 20,000 > RMA S/ 12,598.91, so the **prima is capped** at the RMA; the commission is charged on full remuneration.

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| Annual remuneration (12 months) | 20,000 × 12 | 240,000.00 |
| Less 7 UIT exemption | — | 38,500.00 |
| Net annual taxable income | 240,000 − 38,500 | 201,500.00 |
| Band placement | 201,500 / 5,500 = 36.6 UIT → Band 4 (35–45 UIT) | — |
| Income tax — cumulative at 35 UIT (S/ 192,500) | (from Section 2 table) | 27,775.00 |
| Income tax — Band 4 (20% × (201,500 − 192,500)) | 9,000 × 20% | 1,800.00 |
| Annual income tax | 27,775 + 1,800 | 29,575.00 |
| Monthly income tax | 29,575 ÷ 12 | 2,464.58 |
| AFP mandatory (10% × 20,000) | individual account (no cap) | 2,000.00 |
| AFP insurance prima (1.37% × RMA 12,598.91) | capped | 172.61 |
| AFP commission — PROFUTURO flow (1.69% × 20,000) | on full remuneration | 338.00 |
| Total AFP withholding | 2,000 + 172.61 + 338.00 | 2,510.61 |
| **Net monthly salary** | 20,000 − 2,510.61 − 2,464.58 | **15,024.81** |
| EsSalud (employer, 9% × 20,000) | on top | 1,800.00 |

> Prima cap check: 1.37% × 12,598.91 = 172.6051 → S/ 172.61 ✓ (not 1.37% × 20,000 = S/ 274.00). The mandatory 10% and the commission are NOT RMA-capped — only the prima is.

### Example 5 — Non-domiciled employee, S/ 15,000 gross

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| Gross Peruvian-source remuneration | — | 15,000.00 |
| Income tax (30% flat, no deductions, no 7 UIT) | 15,000 × 30% | 4,500.00 |
| **Net to non-domiciled employee** | 15,000 − 4,500 | **10,500.00** |

> Non-domiciled employment income is taxed at a **30% flat rate on gross** (TUO LIR) — no 7 UIT exemption, no progressive schedule. (PwC) EsSalud/pension treatment for a non-domiciled assignment must be confirmed per the specific arrangement **[RESEARCH GAP]**.

### Example 6 — Employer cost for an S/ 8,000/month employee

| Step | Computation | S/ |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly base salary | — | 8,000.00 |
| EsSalud (employer, 9% × 8,000) | on top | 720.00 |
| **Total monthly employer payroll-contribution cost** | 8,000 + 720 | **8,720.00** |
| Memo: pension (ONP/AFP) and income tax | withheld from the employee — NOT an employer cost | — |
| Memo: CTS / gratificaciones / vacation | **out of scope — provision separately** | **[RESEARCH GAP]** |

> The only payroll contribution the employer pays on top of salary is the **9% EsSalud** (S/ 720). Pension and income tax are employee-borne withholdings. CTS, two gratificaciones, and vacation are statutory employer costs but are out of scope for this skill and must be provisioned separately.

## Section 10 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — the skill applies these directly)

1. **[T1]** UIT 2026 = **S/ 5,500**; the 7 UIT standard exemption = **S/ 38,500** for 2026. (PwC; TUO LIR)
2. **[T1]** Domiciled income tax (5th cat.) is progressive on net taxable income (remuneration − 7 UIT): **8%** (≤5 UIT), **14%** (5–20 UIT), **17%** (20–35 UIT), **20%** (35–45 UIT), **30%** (>45 UIT). (PwC; TUO LIR Art. 53)
3. **[T1]** The additional **up to 3 UIT** deduction is **not** applied by the employer at source by default — default S/ 0 and reconcile at taxpayer level. (PwC; TUO LIR Art. 46)

11. **[T1]** New workers must be registered in **T-Registro within 24 hours** of start date. (SUNAT)
12. **[T1]** Currency is PEN (Sol) only; the tax year is the calendar year. (PwC)

## Section 11 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items depend on facts or sources not fully resolved in this research. The skill must surface them and recommend professional review rather than asserting a single answer.

| Ref | Issue | What the reviewer must resolve |
|---|---|---|
| **[T2-1]** | UIT 2025 (S/ 5,350) | Confirm against the SUNAT/MEF Supreme Decree if the run targets 2025. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| **[T2-2]** | AFP commission rates and the RMA prima cap | Both reset periodically (commission monthly devengue; RMA quarterly). Pull the live SBS figure at publication time. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| **[T2-3]** | EsSalud 9% rate and RMV-floor cite | The SUNAT EsSalud page did not itself state the 9% or the RMV minimum base in the fetched content; 9% is via PwC and the RMV floor is a general labour rule — confirm the exact regulatory cite. |
| **[T2-4]** | Gratificaciones in the income-tax projection | Confirm the 14-month projection mechanics, timing, and the 9% bonificación extraordinaria paid in lieu of EsSalud on gratificaciones. **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| **[T2-5]** | Additional 3 UIT deduction | Confirm the qualifying-expense categories, documentation, and whether/when the employer reflects it. |
| **[T2-6]** | EPS credit (25%) mechanics | Confirm how the EPS credit against EsSalud is computed and filed. |
| **[T2-7]** | Overtime / night / Sunday / holiday premiums and maximum hours | Not researched here — confirm from Peruvian labour law and any convenio colectivo. |
| **[T2-8]** | CTS, gratificaciones, vacation accruals; severance; BIK | Not in this research dataset — reviewer to populate. |
| **[T2-9]** | Exact PLAME monthly deadline | Tied to the last digit of the employer's RUC per SUNAT's annual cronograma — confirm the specific date for the period. |
| **[T2-10]** | EsSalud/pension treatment for non-domiciled assignments | Confirm whether EsSalud and pension apply alongside the 30% income-tax withholding for a given assignment. |

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

When key facts are missing, ask the user these questions before computing. If a question is unanswered, apply the Section 6 conservative default and clearly flag the assumption.

1. What is the employee's **monthly base salary** in PEN?
2. Is the employee **domiciled** or **non-domiciled** in Peru? (Non-domiciled → 30% flat on gross.)
3. Which **pension system** — ONP/SNP (13%) or AFP? If AFP, **which** (HABITAT / INTEGRA / PRIMA / PROFUTURO) and **flow or mixed** scheme?
4. Which **month and year** is this pay run for? (Determines the UIT, RMV, and SBS AFP devengue.)
5. Does the employee have a documented **additional 3 UIT deduction**? (If unproven → S/ 0 at source.)
6. Do **gratificaciones** fall in this period? (Currently flagged out of scope — reviewer to add.)

## Section 17 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (5th-cat. income tax + EsSalud + ONP/AFP) | **This skill (peru-payroll.md)** |
| Peru IGV (VAT) returns | peru-igv.md |
| Peru personal income tax (annual / other categories) | peru-income-tax.md |
| Peru social-security mechanics (detailed EsSalud/ONP/AFP) | peru-social-security.md |
| Cross-border / posted workers / totalization | cross-border-payroll-coordination.md |
| Shared workflow runbook | payroll-workflow-base.md |

### Key handoff points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and the 9% employer EsSalud are expenses; withheld income tax, ONP, and AFP amounts are liabilities until remitted via PLAME/AFPnet.
- **Payroll → Income tax:** Most single-employer wage earners are settled through withholding; some file Formulario Virtual N° 709 where they have additional income/deductions.
- **Payroll → Social security:** ONP/AFP contributions build the employee's pension entitlement; EsSalud funds health coverage. CTS, gratificaciones, and vacation are separate statutory benefits (out of scope here).

### Test Suite

Run these to validate any implementation of this skill. Expected results use **2026** figures (UIT S/ 5,500), domiciled status, the additional 3 UIT deduction at S/ 0, and a 12-month projection unless stated otherwise.

1. **Low earner, ONP.** S/ 3,000/month, ONP. Expect: net annual taxable S/ 0.00, annual income tax S/ 0.00, ONP S/ 390.00/month, net salary S/ 2,610.00, employer EsSalud S/ 270.00.
2. **Mid earner, ONP.** S/ 8,000/month, ONP. Expect: net annual taxable S/ 57,500.00, annual income tax S/ 6,400.00 (S/ 2,200 + S/ 4,200), monthly income tax S/ 533.33, ONP S/ 1,040.00, net salary S/ 6,426.67, employer EsSalud S/ 720.00.
3. **Mid earner, AFP INTEGRA.** S/ 8,000/month, AFP INTEGRA flow. Expect: AFP S/ 1,033.60 (800 + 109.60 + 124.00 = 12.92%), monthly income tax S/ 533.33, net salary S/ 6,433.07, employer EsSalud S/ 720.00.
4. **High earner, AFP PROFUTURO, prima capped.** S/ 20,000/month, AFP PROFUTURO flow. Expect: net annual taxable S/ 201,500.00, annual income tax S/ 29,575.00 (S/ 27,775 + 20% × S/ 9,000), monthly income tax S/ 2,464.58, AFP S/ 2,510.61 (2,000 + prima 172.61 capped at RMA + commission 338.00), net salary S/ 15,024.81, employer EsSalud S/ 1,800.00.
5. **Non-domiciled flat rate.** S/ 15,000 gross to a non-domiciled employee. Expect: income tax S/ 4,500.00 (30% on gross, no deductions), net S/ 10,500.00.
6. **Employer cost.** S/ 8,000/month employee. Expect: employer payroll-contribution cost = salary S/ 8,000 + EsSalud S/ 720 = S/ 8,720.00 (pension and income tax are employee withholdings; CTS/gratificación/vacation out of scope).
7. **Bracket cumulative check.** Confirm cumulative tax at band tops: 5 UIT → S/ 2,200; 20 UIT → S/ 13,750; 35 UIT → S/ 27,775; 45 UIT → S/ 38,775.
8. **Prima cap check.** Confirm the AFP prima for an S/ 20,000 salary is 1.37% × S/ 12,598.91 = S/ 172.61 (capped), NOT 1.37% × S/ 20,000 = S/ 274.00.
9. **7 UIT exemption.** Confirm an S/ 36,000/year (S/ 3,000/month) earner has a S/ 0 income-tax base after the 7 UIT (S/ 38,500) exemption.
10. **Pension is employee-borne.** Confirm ONP/AFP are withheld from the employee and the employer adds only 9% EsSalud on top.
11. **Additional-deduction default.** Additional 3 UIT deduction unconfirmed — confirm the skill applies S/ 0 (not S/ 16,500) and flags the assumption.
12. **Domicile guard.** Confirm the skill applies the 30% flat (no deductions) only when non-domicile is confirmed, and the progressive 8%–30% schedule otherwise.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER claim Peru has no income tax — fifth-category income tax applies to employment income at 8%–30% above the 7 UIT exemption (TUO LIR).
- NEVER apply the additional 3 UIT deduction at source without documented qualifying expenses — default to S/ 0 and flag it.
- NEVER treat the pension (ONP 13% / AFP ≈12.84%–13.06%) as an employer cost — it is withheld from the employee.
- NEVER assume ONP vs AFP — the system is the employee's choice and must be confirmed before computing the pension.
- NEVER apply the AFP prima (1.37%) above the RMA (S/ 12,598.91, Q2 2026) — the prima is RMA-capped; the 10% mandatory and the commission are not.
- NEVER use a single "average" AFP commission — use the per-AFP figure from the live SBS table for the correct devengue.
- NEVER deduct EsSalud (9%) from the employee's pay — it is an employer contribution on top of salary.
- NEVER apply the progressive schedule to a non-domiciled employee — non-domiciled pay a 30% definitive flat rate on gross.
- NEVER run a full-time employee below the RMV (S/ 1,130/month).
- NEVER omit T-Registro within 24 hours of a new worker's start date — SUNAFIL fines apply.
- NEVER quote a penalty figure as definitive — the Código Tributario / SUNAFIL amounts here are pending reviewer confirmation.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label them as estimated and direct the user to a licensed Peruvian Contador Público Colegiado.
