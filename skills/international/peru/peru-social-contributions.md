# Peru Social Security, Health & Payroll Contributions Skill v0.1

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Peru (Republic of Peru) |
| Currency | PEN (Peruvian Sol, S/) |

| EsSalud (health) | 9% of remuneration, employer-borne, no cap ([PwC, other taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)) |
| ONP (public pension) | 13% of remuneration, employee-borne ([PwC, other taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)) |
| AFP (private pension) | ~12.84%–13.06% of remuneration, employee-borne ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes); [TrámitesPerú](https://tramitesperu.com/comparadores/afp-comisiones/)) |

| Validation date | Pending |

**Who pays what (monthly payroll):**

| Item | Rate | Borne by | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| EsSalud (health) | 9% | Employer | None; min base = RMV ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)) |
| ONP (public pension) — IF employee in ONP | 13% | Employee | None ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)) |
| AFP (private pension) — IF employee in AFP | ~12.84%–13.06% | Employee | None on the 10%; prima capped at RMA ([TrámitesPerú](https://tramitesperu.com/comparadores/afp-comisiones/)) |
| Fifth-category income tax | 8%–30% progressive (UIT brackets) | Employee (withheld) | n/a ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)) |

> **IMPORTANT — pension is one OR the other.** Every employee belongs to EITHER ONP (public) OR an AFP (private), never both. The employer withholds whichever applies. Employers do NOT pay a separate pension match.

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency status | Assume resident (domiciled) — flag for reviewer |
| Unknown pension regime (ONP vs AFP) | STOP — ask; the rate differs (13% vs ~12.84%–13.06%) |
| Unknown AFP | Use the highest documented total to be conservative; flag for reviewer |
| Salary below RMV (for EsSalud) | Apply 9% on the RMV (PEN 1,130) minimum base |
| Unknown tax year | Assume 2026 (UIT = 5,500) and state assumption |
| Unknown whether non-domiciled | Do not apply 7-UIT exemption until confirmed; flag |
| Penalty figures | STOP — not in scope; escalate (see Section 10) |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly remuneration (PEN), residency status (domiciled / non-domiciled), and pension regime (ONP or AFP). Without the pension regime, STOP — the deduction rate cannot be determined.

**Recommended** — for AFP members, which AFP and which commission regime (comisión por flujo vs comisión mixta); tax year (for UIT and RMV); whether other employers or income exist.

**Ideal** — boleta de pago (payslip), PLAME export, AFPnet / ONP statements, the employer's RUC ending digit (for deadlines), and prior boletas to confirm the year-to-date withholding projection.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-PE-1 — Pension regime unknown.** *Trigger:* not told whether the employee is in ONP or an AFP. *Message:* "The pension deduction is 13% (ONP) or ~12.84%–13.06% (AFP), and the two are mutually exclusive. Cannot compute the net deduction without confirming the regime. Please provide the worker's pension affiliation."

**R-PE-2 — AFP insurance ceiling (RMA).** *Trigger:* high earner where the prima de seguro ceiling (RMA) bites. *Message:* "The disability/survivor insurance premium (1.37%) is capped at the Remuneración Máxima Asegurable, which the SBS updates EVERY QUARTER. I cannot apply a stale figure. The current-quarter RMA must be re-verified on the SBS page before computing. Escalate to a reviewer."

**R-PE-3 — Penalties / late filing.** *Trigger:* late PLAME, unpaid contributions, CTS non-deposit, or any sanction quantification. *Message:* "Peruvian penalty schedules (SUNAT Código Tributario Tabla de Infracciones, SUNAFIL labour fines) were not obtained from an authoritative source for this skill. Do not estimate. Escalate to a Peruvian contador público colegiado."

**R-PE-4 — Non-domiciled / expat treatment.** *Trigger:* client claims non-resident status, split year, or treaty relief. *Message:* "Non-domiciled individuals are taxed at a flat 30% on gross Peruvian-source employment income with NO 7-UIT exemption and NO deductions. Residency determination and any treaty relief require case-specific confirmation. Escalate to a reviewer."

**R-PE-5 — CTS / gratificaciones quantification at the cent.** *Trigger:* request for an exact CTS or gratificación figure to deposit. *Message:* "CTS and gratificaciones depend on the computation base (including 1/6 of the gratificación for CTS, family allowance, average variable pay, and months of service). I can explain the framework but the exact deposit must be confirmed by the reviewer against payslips."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Peruvian payroll, social contributions, and tax. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Statutory contributions and tax withholdings remitted to SUNAT/AFP are EXCLUDED from any IGV (VAT) input-tax claim — they are payroll/tax obligations, not taxable supplies.

### 3.1 SUNAT payments (income tax withholding, EsSalud, ONP via PLAME)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SUNAT, PAGO SUNAT | EXCLUDE — tax/contribution remittance | PLAME / Form 0601 monthly payment |
| PLAME, PLANILLA ELECTRONICA | EXCLUDE — payroll declaration payment | Covers renta 5ta, EsSalud, ONP |
| RENTA QUINTA, RENTA 5TA, 5TA CATEGORIA | EXCLUDE — income tax withheld | Employee PIT remitted to SUNAT |
| ESSALUD, ES SALUD | EXCLUDE — employer health contribution | 9%, employer cost |
| ONP, SNP | EXCLUDE — public pension withheld | 13%, employee-borne |
| FORMULARIO 0601, FORM 0601 | EXCLUDE — PLAME payment | Monthly form |

### 3.2 AFP / private pension payments (AFPnet)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| AFPNET, AFP NET | EXCLUDE — private pension remittance | Employer collects/remits employee deduction |
| AFP HABITAT, AFP INTEGRA, AFP PRIMA, AFP PROFUTURO | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | Name of the AFP |
| SPP, SISTEMA PRIVADO PENSIONES | EXCLUDE — private pension | Same |
| APORTE OBLIGATORIO, COMISION AFP, PRIMA SEGURO | EXCLUDE — AFP components | 10% / commission / 1.37% |

### 3.3 Employer-borne benefits (CTS, gratificaciones)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CTS, COMP TIEMPO SERVICIOS | EXCLUDE — severance deposit | Twice-yearly bank deposit (15 May / 15 Nov) |
| GRATIFICACION, GRATI, FIESTAS PATRIAS, AGUINALDO | EXCLUDE — statutory bonus | July & December |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ABONO HABERES, PAGO PLANILLA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | Net wage to employee |
| SUELDO, REMUNERACION, HABERES (incoming) | EXCLUDE — employment income received | Not a contribution |
| TELECREDITO, PAGO DE HABERES | EXCLUDE — payroll batch | Bank payroll module |

### 3.5 Pension income received (NOT a contribution)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION ONP, PENSION SNP | EXCLUDE — pension income received | Not a contribution paid |
| PENSION AFP, RETIRO AFP, JUBILACION | EXCLUDE — pension/withdrawal received | Not a contribution |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Lima employer and its staff. All figures in PEN, tax year 2026 (UIT = 5,500, RMV = 1,130).

### Example 1 — Monthly PLAME remittance to SUNAT (BCP)

**Input line:**
`16.02.2026 ; SUNAT PAGO PLAME 0601 ; DEBIT ; PERIODO ENE-2026 ; -3,250.00 ; PEN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "SUNAT" and "PLAME 0601" (pattern 3.1). This is the monthly Planilla Electrónica payment covering fifth-category income tax withheld, EsSalud (9% employer), and ONP (13% employee). The Feb date for the January period is consistent with the SUNAT cronograma (deadline by RUC digit, ≈14th–24th of the following month). Exclude from IGV input claim — it is tax/contribution remittance.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — SUNAT payroll remittance (renta 5ta + EsSalud + ONP).

### Example 2 — AFP remittance via AFPnet (BBVA)

**Input line:**
`05.02.2026 ; AFPNET AFP INTEGRA ; DEBIT ; APORTES ENE-2026 ; -1,940.00 ; PEN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "AFPNET" / "AFP INTEGRA" (pattern 3.2). This is the employer remitting employees' AFP deductions (mandatory 10% + prima 1.37% + Integra commission) to AFP Integra. It is an employee-borne deduction remitted by the employer, not an employer pension cost. Exclude from IGV.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — AFP private pension remittance (employee deductions).

### Example 3 — EsSalud on a single PEN 5,000 salary

**Scenario (not a bank line — a computation):** Employee earns PEN 5,000/month gross.

**Reasoning:**
EsSalud = 9% of remuneration, employer-borne, no cap, minimum base RMV ([PwC, other taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)). 5,000 × 9% = **PEN 450.00**. As actual pay (5,000) exceeds the RMV (1,130), the minimum base does not bite. This is an employer cost — NOT deducted from the employee.

**Classification:** Employer EsSalud cost = PEN 450.00/month. Excluded from the employee's net pay computation.

### Example 4 — AFP deduction detail (Habitat, comisión por flujo)

**Scenario:** Employee earns PEN 5,000/month gross, affiliated to AFP Habitat on comisión por flujo.

**Reasoning (rates: [TrámitesPerú](https://tramitesperu.com/comparadores/afp-comisiones/), [Misha](https://misha.pe/laboral/prima-seguro-afp/)):**
- Mandatory contribution (aporte obligatorio): 10% × 5,000 = 500.00
- Disability/survivor insurance (prima): 1.37% × 5,000 = 68.50 *(below the RMA ceiling, so full base applies)*
- Habitat commission (comisión por flujo): 1.47% × 5,000 = 73.50
- **Total AFP deduction = 12.84% × 5,000 = 642.00** (500.00 + 68.50 + 73.50 = 642.00 ✓)

**Classification:** Employee AFP deduction = PEN 642.00/month, withheld from gross.

### Example 5 — ONP deduction (same PEN 5,000 salary, public regime)

**Scenario:** Same PEN 5,000/month employee, but affiliated to ONP, not an AFP.

**Reasoning:**
ONP = 13% of remuneration, employee-borne ([PwC, other taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)). 5,000 × 13% = **PEN 650.00/month** withheld. Note this exceeds the AFP total in Example 4 (642.00) — the regimes genuinely differ. The employee is in ONP OR AFP, never both.

**Classification:** Employee ONP deduction = PEN 650.00/month, withheld from gross.

### Example 6 — CTS deposit (Interbank)

**Input line:**
`14.05.2026 ; CTS DEPOSITO BCP CTA ; DEBIT ; CTS MAY-2026 ; -2,500.00 ; PEN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CTS DEPOSITO" (pattern 3.3). CTS (Compensación por Tiempo de Servicios) is a statutory severance fund deposited to the employee's bank CTS account in two tranches — by 15 May and by 15 November ([EY Peru](https://www.ey.com/es_pe/insights/workforce/cts)). This is an employer labour cost, not a SUNAT/AFP contribution. The exact amount depends on the computation base (including 1/6 of the gratificación) — confirm against payslips (see R-PE-5). Exclude from IGV.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — CTS severance deposit (employer cost). Exact base to be confirmed by reviewer.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payslip/bank data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 — EsSalud formula

```
EsSalud = max(remuneration, RMV) × 9%      [employer-borne, no upper cap]
```

RMV = PEN 1,130 (from 1 Jan 2025; [Andina](https://andina.pe/agencia/noticia-remuneracion-minima-vital-sube-a-1130-soles-a-partir-del-1-enero-2025-1012953.aspx)). 9% rate ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)). If the employer runs a private EPS plan, up to 25% of the EsSalud obligation is credited to the EPS (~2.25% to EPS, ~6.75% still to EsSalud) ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes)).

### Rule 2 — Pension is ONP OR AFP, never both

If ONP: 13% × remuneration, employee-borne. If AFP: 10% + 1.37% prima + AFP commission, employee-borne. Determine the regime before computing. ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/other-taxes))

### Rule 3 — AFP three components

```
AFP deduction = 10% (mandatory) + 1.37% (prima, capped at RMA) + commission
```

Commission by AFP, comisión por flujo ([TrámitesPerú](https://tramitesperu.com/comparadores/afp-comisiones/)):

| AFP | Flujo commission | Total (flujo) |
|---|---|---|
| Habitat | 1.47% | 12.84% |
| Integra | 1.55% | 12.92% |
| Prima | 1.60% | 12.97% |
| Profuturo | 1.69% | 13.06% |

Each total = 10% + 1.37% + commission. (Habitat: 10 + 1.37 + 1.47 = 12.84 ✓; Profuturo: 10 + 1.37 + 1.69 = 13.06 ✓.) The prima (1.37%) is uniform across all AFPs ([Misha](https://misha.pe/laboral/prima-seguro-afp/)).

### Rule 4 — AFP comisión mixta

Under comisión mixta the flow commission is **0%** for all four AFPs (since Feb 2023), replaced by an annual charge on the fund balance: Profuturo 0.68%, Integra 0.78%, Habitat & Prima 1.25% ([TrámitesPerú](https://tramitesperu.com/comparadores/afp-comisiones/)). Under comisión mixta the on-salary deduction is therefore 10% + 1.37% = 11.37% only.

### Rule 5 — Prima ceiling (RMA)

The 1.37% prima applies only up to the Remuneración Máxima Asegurable (RMA), updated **quarterly** by the SBS. Reported ~PEN 12,209.11 (early 2026) and PEN 12,598.91 for Apr–Jun 2026 ([SBS schedule](https://www.sbs.gob.pe/app/spp/empleadores/comisiones_spp/Paginas/comision_prima.aspx)). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact current-quarter RMA on the SBS page before applying; it changes every quarter.]** The 10% mandatory contribution and the commission have NO ceiling.

### Rule 6 — Fifth-category income tax brackets (residents)

Brackets are denominated in UIT; convert with the year's UIT (2026 = PEN 5,500; [PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)).

| Bracket | Annual taxable income (UIT) | 2026 PEN range | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Up to 5 UIT | 0 – 27,500 | 8% |
| 2 | Over 5 to 20 UIT | 27,500 – 110,000 | 14% |
| 3 | Over 20 to 35 UIT | 110,000 – 192,500 | 17% |
| 4 | Over 35 to 45 UIT | 192,500 – 247,500 | 20% |
| 5 | Over 45 UIT | Over 247,500 | 30% |

### Rule 7 — The 7-UIT exemption (residents only)

```
Taxable base = annual gross employment income − 7 UIT [− up to 3 UIT documented expenses]
```

7 UIT: 2025 = 7 × 5,350 = PEN 37,450; 2026 = 7 × 5,500 = PEN 38,500. An additional up to 3 UIT is deductible for documented expenses (property lease, professional services, hotels, restaurants, etc.) ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)).

### Rule 8 — Non-domiciled flat rate

Non-domiciled individuals: flat **30%** on gross Peruvian-source employment income, NO 7-UIT exemption, NO additional deductions ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/peru/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)).

### Rule 9 — Monthly PLAME filing

File PLAME (Planilla Electrónica), Formulario Virtual 0601, monthly. Version 4.5 mandatory for periods from Oct 2025 ([SUNAT](https://orientacion.sunat.gob.pe/pdt-plame)). Deadline by the last digit of the employer's RUC per SUNAT's annual cronograma (≈14th–24th of the following month). AFP remittance via AFPnet on a similar monthly cycle.

### Rule 10 — Annual return

FY2025 return filed in 2026: due 27 May – 10 Jun 2026 by last RUC digit ([NVC Abogados](https://nvcabogados.com/annual-income-tax-return-2025-in-peru/)). Most pure-payroll (5th-category) employees do NOT file — the employer withholds monthly. Filing is required for: multiple employers, additional-deduction claims, other income categories not fully withheld, or SUNAT-designated obligors.

### Rule 11 — Registration

Employers obtain a RUC from SUNAT and register workers in the Planilla Electrónica / T-Registro before payroll ([cadanapay](https://cadanapay.com/blog/employer-payroll-compliance-in-peru-complete-guide-to-sunat-essalud-afp-onp-and-plame)). Registration is triggered by employing staff, not by a wage threshold. [RESEARCH GAP — no monetary registration threshold found; reviewer to confirm none exists.]

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When payslip/bank data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 — Pension regime not evidenced

**Trigger:** A deduction appears but it is unclear whether the worker is ONP or AFP.

**Issue:** 13% (ONP) vs ~12.84%–13.06% (AFP) — a meaningful difference, and the AFP components are not deductible the same way. Cannot assume.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer; request AFPnet/ONP affiliation evidence.

### T2-2 — High earner near the RMA ceiling

**Trigger:** Monthly remuneration approaches or exceeds the RMA (~PEN 12,200–12,600).

**Issue:** The 1.37% prima is capped at the RMA, which changes quarterly; the 10% and commission are not capped. A stale RMA produces a wrong figure.

**Action:** Re-verify the current-quarter RMA on the SBS page. Flag for reviewer. [RESEARCH GAP — exact RMA per quarter.]

### T2-3 — EPS (private health plan) credit

**Trigger:** Employer offers an EPS plan alongside EsSalud.

**Issue:** Up to 25% of the EsSalud obligation is credited to the EPS (~2.25% redirected, ~6.75% still to EsSalud). The split depends on the plan.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer; confirm the EPS contract and the credited percentage.

### T2-4 — Multiple employers / additional deductions

**Trigger:** Worker has more than one employer, or wants to claim the additional 3-UIT expenses.

**Issue:** Withholding by a single employer will under- or over-state the annual liability; an annual return may be required.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer; an annual Declaración Jurada may be due.

### T2-5 — Non-domiciled / split-year residency

**Trigger:** Foreign worker, partial-year presence, or treaty claim.

**Issue:** Flat 30% with no exemption applies to non-domiciled; residency determination and treaty relief are case-specific.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Do not apply the 7-UIT exemption until residency is confirmed.

### T2-6 — CTS / gratificaciones exact base

**Trigger:** Request for the exact CTS or gratificación amount.

**Issue:** Base includes 1/6 of the gratificación (for CTS), family allowance, average variable pay, and months of service.

**Action:** Explain framework only; reviewer confirms the deposit against payslips.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How Peru payroll/contribution debits appear

**BCP (Banco de Crédito del Perú):**
- SUNAT: "SUNAT PAGO", "PAGO PLAME", "TRIBUTOS SUNAT" — monthly, ≈14th–24th of the following month
- Payroll: "TELECREDITO HABERES", "ABONO DE HABERES" — net wages out
- CTS: "CTS DEPOSITO" — May and November

**BBVA Perú:**
- "AFPNET", "AFP [name]", "SUNAT", "PAGO DE PLANILLA"

**Interbank / Scotiabank Perú:**
- "PAGO HABERES", "SUNAT TRIBUTOS", "AFPNET", "CTS"

**Key identification tips:**
1. SUNAT debits cover renta 5ta + EsSalud + ONP together (via PLAME) — one payment, multiple obligations.
2. AFP deductions are remitted separately via AFPnet (not bundled into the SUNAT payment).
3. EsSalud is an employer cost (9%); ONP/AFP are employee deductions withheld then remitted.
4. CTS and gratificaciones are employer labour costs, NOT social contributions — twice-yearly (CTS) and July/December (gratis).
5. Inbound "PENSION ONP/AFP" credits are pension income received, not contributions paid.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for SUNAT debits** — identify monthly "SUNAT / PLAME / 0601" payments; these bundle renta 5ta + EsSalud + ONP.
2. **Scan for AFPnet debits** — separate from SUNAT; indicates AFP-affiliated employees.
3. **Infer the pension regime mix:** if AFPnet debits exist → some/all staff in AFP; if ONP appears in PLAME only → ONP staff. Do not assume a single regime across all employees.
4. **Identify CTS (May/Nov) and gratificaciones (Jul/Dec)** as employer benefit costs, not contributions.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution split derived from bank statement descriptions only. Pension regime per employee, residency status, UIT/RMV year, and the RMA ceiling have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before relying on any figure."

### Penalties

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm.] A precise, authority-published penalty schedule (UIT-multiples / interest for late PLAME filing, late contribution payment, or CTS non-deposit) was NOT obtained from SUNAT or a Big-4 source for this skill. Verify directly against SUNAT's Código Tributario Tabla de Infracciones y Sanciones and SUNAFIL's labour-fine schedule before quoting any figure. Do not invent penalty numbers.

### Worked tax computation (resident, 2026, UIT = 5,500)

Annual gross employment income PEN 150,000:
- Less 7 UIT (38,500) = 111,500 taxable base (no additional 3-UIT expenses claimed)
- Bracket 1: 27,500 × 8% = 2,200.00
- Bracket 2: (110,000 − 27,500 = 82,500) × 14% = 11,550.00
- Bracket 3: (111,500 − 110,000 = 1,500) × 17% = 255.00
- **Annual income tax = 2,200.00 + 11,550.00 + 255.00 = PEN 14,005.00** ✓

### Test suite

**Test 1 — EsSalud, PEN 6,000 salary, 2026.** 6,000 × 9% = **PEN 540.00** (employer). RMV min base not binding.

**Test 2 — EsSalud, PEN 900 salary (below RMV).** Base = max(900, 1,130) = 1,130; 1,130 × 9% = **PEN 101.70** (employer).

**Test 3 — ONP, PEN 4,000 salary.** 4,000 × 13% = **PEN 520.00** (employee deduction).

**Test 4 — AFP Habitat (flujo), PEN 4,000 salary.** 10% = 400.00; prima 1.37% = 54.80; commission 1.47% = 58.80; total 12.84% = **PEN 513.60** (400 + 54.80 + 58.80 = 513.60 ✓).

**Test 5 — AFP Profuturo (flujo), PEN 4,000 salary.** 10% = 400.00; prima 1.37% = 54.80; commission 1.69% = 67.60; total 13.06% = **PEN 522.40** (400 + 54.80 + 67.60 = 522.40 ✓).

**Test 6 — Resident income tax, annual income PEN 38,500 (2026).** Less 7 UIT (38,500) = 0 taxable base. **Income tax = PEN 0.00** (income equals the exemption).

**Test 7 — Resident income tax, annual income PEN 60,000 (2026).** Less 7 UIT (38,500) = 21,500 base. All within bracket 1 (≤27,500): 21,500 × 8% = **PEN 1,720.00**.

**Test 8 — Non-domiciled, monthly Peruvian-source salary PEN 10,000.** Flat 30%, no exemption: 10,000 × 30% = **PEN 3,000.00** withheld.

**Test 9 — Net pay, ONP member, PEN 5,000 salary, 2026 (illustrative).** Gross 5,000 − ONP 650.00 (13%) − monthly income tax. Annual income 60,000 → annual tax 1,720.00 (Test 7) → ≈ 143.33/month. Net ≈ 5,000 − 650.00 − 143.33 = **PEN 4,206.67**. (Employer separately pays EsSalud 450.00.)

**Test 10 — Pension regime unknown.** STOP. Refuse per R-PE-1; cannot pick 13% vs ~12.84%–13.06%.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute a pension deduction without confirming ONP vs AFP — they are mutually exclusive and differ.
- NEVER charge both ONP and AFP to the same worker.
- NEVER apply the 1.37% prima above the RMA without re-verifying the current-quarter RMA on the SBS page.
- NEVER apply the 7-UIT exemption to a non-domiciled individual — they pay flat 30% with no exemption.
- NEVER use a stale UIT — confirm the tax year (2025 = 5,350; 2026 = 5,500).
- NEVER treat EsSalud as an employee deduction — it is an employer cost.
- NEVER quote a Peru penalty figure from this skill — none was authoritatively sourced; escalate.
- NEVER state an exact CTS or gratificación deposit without the reviewer confirming the computation base.
- NEVER present any figure as definitive — label as estimated and direct the client to SUNAT/AFPnet/payslip records.
- NEVER confuse inbound pension income (PENSION ONP/AFP credits) with outbound contributions.
