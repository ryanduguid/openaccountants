### Conservative defaults

**Conservative defaults table**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Sector/rate unclear | Apply 30% standard |
| Forex-remittance concession (15%) claimed | Apply 30% until remittance-through-a-bank evidence confirmed |
| Betting/gaming or liquor/tobacco activity | Apply 45% (flat) unless it is export (then 30%) |
| SME / sector concession asserted | Do NOT apply — not confirmed in this skill; VERIFY against current IRA/IRD |

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- **Minimum viable inputs** — audited or draft financial statements (P&L, balance sheet), prior-year return, taxable-income computation, confirmation of (i) sector (standard / betting-gaming / liquor-tobacco / export), (ii) any foreign-currency-remitted income claiming the 15% rate, (iii) WHT/AIT credits.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-LK-CT-1** — Banking, insurance, and sector special regimes. These carry separate computation rules. Out of scope — escalate.
- **R-LK-CT-2** — SME / concessionary sector rates not in this skill. Any SME or sector-specific concessionary rate must be VERIFIED against the current IRA and IRD guidance — this skill asserts only the 30% standard, 15% remitted-forex, and 45% betting/liquor/tobacco rates.
- **R-LK-CT-3** — Group taxation, transfer pricing, reorganisations. Out of scope — escalate.
- **R-LK-CT-4** — Cross-skill scope. Personal tax → `sri-lanka-income-tax`; WHT/AIT → `sri-lanka-withholding-tax`; SSCL → `sri-lanka-sscl`; VAT → `sri-lanka-vat`.

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rates

### 3.1 Standard rate — 30%

- **Standard corporate income tax rate** — 30% percent (of taxable income, in force since 1 April 2023 (it was 24% from 1 January 2020, and 28% before that). Apply to taxable income computed under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017.)  _(Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017)_
- **Standard CIT formula** — Standard CIT = 30% × Taxable income  _(Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017)_

### 3.2 Concessionary rate — 15% (remitted foreign currency)

- **Concessionary rate on remitted foreign-currency income/services** — 15% percent (applies to qualifying foreign-currency-source income and services remitted to Sri Lanka through a bank. Require evidence of the foreign-currency source and the banking-channel remittance before applying.)

### 3.3 Higher rate — 45% (betting/gaming, liquor, tobacco)

- **Higher rate on betting/gaming and liquor/tobacco** — 45% percent (applies to income from a business consisting of: betting and gaming; or manufacture and sale, or import and sale, of any liquor or tobacco product. Raised from 40% effective 1 April 2025 (Act No. 02 of 2025). The same 45% flat rate applies to individuals carrying on such business income.)  _(Act No. 02 of 2025)_
- **Export of liquor/tobacco products** — 30% percent (The export of liquor or tobacco products is taxed at the 30% normal rate, not 45%.)

## Section 4 — Tier 2

- **Capital gains.** Gains on the realisation of investment assets are taxed at a flat **10%** (resident and non-resident). Company-specific characterisation (business asset vs investment asset) — VERIFY with the practitioner.
- **Losses, depreciation, allowances.** Computed under the IRA (Second/Fourth Schedules) — detailed loss carry-forward and capital-allowance rules are NOT asserted here; VERIFY against the IRA.
- **SSCL interaction.** SSCL (2.5% on liable turnover) is a separate levy — see `sri-lanka-sscl`.

- **Capital gains on realisation of investment assets** — 10% percent (flat rate for resident and non-resident; separate from business income. Company-specific characterisation (business asset vs investment asset) — VERIFY with the practitioner.)

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### 5.1 Standard company

Taxable income LKR 50,000,000 → CIT = 30% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 15,000,000**.

### 5.2 Liquor manufacturer (domestic)

Taxable income LKR 50,000,000 from domestic liquor manufacture/sale → CIT = 45% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 22,500,000**. (If the same income were from **export** of the product, the rate would be 30%.)

### 5.3 IT services exporter, forex remitted through a bank

Qualifying remitted foreign-currency services income LKR 50,000,000 → CIT = 15% × 50,000,000 = **LKR 7,500,000**, provided the banking-channel remittance is evidenced.

## Section 6 — Filing

- **Year of assessment:** 1 April – 31 March.
- **Statement of Estimated Tax Payable (SET):** under IRA s.91; YA 2025/26 due **15 August 2025**.
- **Annual return + payment / quarterly instalment dates:** VERIFY against the current IRD calendar (not asserted here).

- **Statement of Estimated Tax Payable (SET) due date** — 15 August 2025 (YA 2025/26, filed under IRA s.91)  _(IRA s.91)_

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

## Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the 24% or 28% historical rate to YA 2025/26 — the standard rate is 30%.
- NEVER apply the 15% concession without banking-channel forex-remittance evidence.
- NEVER use the old 40% rate for betting/gaming/liquor/tobacco for periods from 1 April 2025 — it is 45%.
- NEVER assert an SME/sector concession this skill flags as VERIFY.
- NEVER file or instruct filing — produce a working paper for practitioner review.
