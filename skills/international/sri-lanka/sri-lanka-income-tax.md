### Sri Lanka HAS a personal income tax

- **Progressive personal income tax applies** — Unlike some Gulf jurisdictions, Sri Lanka levies progressive personal income tax on resident individuals and on non-resident citizens. The 2025/2026 rules derive from the Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 02 of 2025, effective 1 April 2025.  _(Inland Revenue (Amendment) Act No. 02 of 2025)_

### Personal Income Tax Brackets (Resident individuals, YA 2025/2026)

- **Personal relief application** — Personal relief: Rs. 1,800,000 / year is deducted from assessable income before the slabs apply. Relief does not apply to gains from realisation of investment assets. Available to residents and non-resident citizens of Sri Lanka (not to non-citizen non-residents).  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026; IRD Notice PN/IT/2025-01 (26.03.2025))_

**Progressive rates on taxable income after the Rs. 1,800,000 relief**  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026 -- https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/SitePages/tax_chart_2526.aspx?menuid=1404 ; IRD PN/IT/2025-01)_

| Slab (taxable income after relief) | Width | Rate | Tax on slab | Cumulative tax at top of slab |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First Rs. 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 6% | Rs. 60,000 | Rs. 60,000 |
| Next Rs. 500,000 (1,000,001 -- 1,500,000) | 500,000 | 18% | Rs. 90,000 | Rs. 150,000 |
| Next Rs. 500,000 (1,500,001 -- 2,000,000) | 500,000 | 24% | Rs. 120,000 | Rs. 270,000 |
| Next Rs. 500,000 (2,000,001 -- 2,500,000) | 500,000 | 30% | Rs. 150,000 | Rs. 420,000 |
| Balance (above Rs. 2,500,000) | -- | 36% | -- | -- |

- **Structural changes from 1 Apr 2025** — first slab widened Rs. 500,000 -> Rs. 1,000,000; the former 12% band removed; top rate remains 36%.  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026; IRD PN/IT/2025-01)_

### Special / concessionary rates (YA 2025/2026)

**Special / concessionary rates**  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026)_

| Income type | Rate | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gains on realisation of investment assets (capital gains) | 10% | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |
| Foreign-source income remitted through a bank | max 15% | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |
| Service income earned in / remitted via foreign currency through a bank (relevant to IT/freelance exporters) | max 15% | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |
| Income from betting & gaming, liquor, tobacco | 45% | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |

### Partnerships (where a self-employed person trades in partnership)

- **Partnership taxation** — Taxed at the partnership level: taxable income up to Rs. 1,000,000 at 0%; excess at 6%; partnership investment-asset gains at 10%. Partners' shares are then exempt at the individual level.  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026 -- https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/SitePages/tax_chart_2526.aspx?menuid=1404)_

### Payroll contributions (EPF / ETF) -- summary

**EPF/ETF contribution table**  _(EPF (CBSL) Employer FAQ -- https://epf.lk/?page_id=811 ; ETF Board Employers FAQ -- https://etfb.lk/employers-faq/)_

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EPF (Employees' Provident Fund) | 8% | 12% | 20% |
| ETF (Employees' Trust Fund) | 0% | 3% | 3% |
| **Total of contributions** | **8%** | **15%** | **23%** |

- **Total typical employer on-cost** — Total typical employer on-cost over gross = 15% (EPF 12% + ETF 3%), plus gratuity provisioning.  _(EPF (CBSL) Employer FAQ; ETF Board Employers FAQ)_

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative defaults table**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residence status | STOP -- relief and rates differ for non-citizen non-residents |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown whether income is foreign-source remitted via bank | Treat as ordinary income (progressive rates), flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether person is an instalment payer | Assume instalment payer if any business / self-employment income |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume not registered; flag if turnover near threshold |
| Unknown gratuity entitlement | Flag -- depends on years of service and employer size |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

- **Minimum viable / Recommended / Ideal / Refusal** — Minimum viable -- bank statement for the full year of assessment (1 Apr -- 31 Mar) in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residence status (resident / non-resident citizen / non-citizen non-resident) and source of income (employment APIT, self-employment/business, or both). Recommended -- sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, EPF/ETF contribution records, prior-year return or assessment, APIT certificate(s) from employer(s), withholding/AIT certificates (interest, rent, dividends), TIN. Ideal -- complete income and expenditure statement, asset register, Statement of Estimated Tax (SET) and quarterly instalment receipts, foreign-currency remittance evidence (for the 15% concession). Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN. No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify all deductions are supported by valid documentation and that income source classifications (especially foreign-currency concessions and capital gains) are correct."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-LK-1** — Residence status unknown. "Residence status determines whether the Rs. 1,800,000 personal relief applies and which rates are used. A non-citizen non-resident does not get the relief; a non-resident citizen does. This skill cannot compute tax without it. Please confirm."
- **R-LK-2** — Companies / partnerships filing. "This skill covers individuals and sole proprietors. Partnership-level returns and company income tax (corporate rates) are out of scope -- escalate to a Sri Lankan tax professional."
- **R-LK-3** — Investment-asset (capital) gains. "Gains on realisation of investment assets are taxed at 10% and the personal relief does NOT apply to them. The base computation requires asset cost, proceeds, and dates. Escalate to a reviewer for capital gains."
- **R-LK-4** — Foreign-source / foreign-currency concessions. "The max-15% concessions for foreign-source income or foreign-currency service income remitted through a bank depend on remittance evidence and bank routing. Flag and escalate -- do not apply the 15% cap without confirmation."
- **R-LK-5** — Arrears / enforcement / penalties. "Client has outstanding tax, EPF/ETF arrears, or is subject to IRD enforcement. Escalating surcharges (EPF/ETF up to 50%) and income-tax penalties/interest apply. Escalate to a Sri Lankan tax professional immediately."
- **R-LK-6** — VAT / SSCL return requested. "This skill covers personal income tax only. VAT and the Social Security Contribution Levy (SSCL) are separate turnover taxes -- see Section 10 for thresholds, then use the relevant indirect-tax skill."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

Deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank-statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears on the statement. If multiple match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5. Local-language (Sinhala/Tamil transliteration and English) terms are included.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Local client payment (not VAT-registered)

Input line:
`14/06/2025 ; BOC FUND TRANSFER IN ; PERERA TRADING (PVT) LTD ; INV-2025-021 ; +250,000.00 ; LKR`

Reasoning:
Local fee for services. Client is below VAT threshold and not registered, so the full Rs. 250,000 is business income. No VAT to strip out.

Classification: Business income = Rs. 250,000.

### Example 2 -- Foreign-currency freelance payout (concession FLAG)

Input line:
`28/06/2025 ; COMBANK CEFT ; PAYONEER INC ; USD SERVICE PAYOUT ; +480,000.00 ; LKR`

Reasoning:
Service income earned in / remitted via foreign currency through a bank may qualify for the max-15% concession (IRD tax chart 2025/2026). This is reviewer judgement -- it depends on remittance routing and documentation. Do NOT auto-apply the 15% cap. Default: include Rs. 480,000 as business income at progressive rates and FLAG for the reviewer to assess the concession.

Classification: Business income = Rs. 480,000. FLAG -- possible 15% foreign-currency-service concession (R-LK-4).

### Example 3 -- Bank interest with 10% WHT deducted

Input line:
`30/09/2025 ; HNB ; FD INTEREST CREDIT ; NET OF WHT ; +90,000.00 ; LKR`

Reasoning:
Interest and discount income carries 10% WHT/AIT at source from 1 Apr 2025 (up from 5%). If the credit is shown net of WHT, gross it up: Rs. 90,000 / 0.90 = Rs. 100,000 gross, with Rs. 10,000 WHT credit. For a resident with total annual income above Rs. 1,800,000, interest is included; the 10% deducted is a credit against the final liability. For a non-resident citizen, the 10% on bank interest is a final tax (not added to the progressive computation).
Source: IRD tax chart 2025/2026; https://www.taxadvisor.lk/article/ntri

Classification: Investment income gross = Rs. 100,000; WHT credit = Rs. 10,000. (Confirm whether net or gross is shown on the statement.)

### Example 4 -- SaaS subscription (deductible)

Input line:
`01/07/2025 ; SAMPATH ONLINE ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD ; -9,500.00 ; LKR`

Reasoning:
Recurring software subscription used in the business. Fully deductible operating expense.

Classification: Deductible expense = Rs. 9,500.

### Example 5 -- EPF/ETF remittance by a sole proprietor with staff

Input line:
`31/07/2025 ; BOC STANDING ORDER ; EPF DEPARTMENT ; JUN 2025 CONTRIB ; -160,000.00 ; LKR`

Reasoning:
This is the employer EPF remittance for staff (employee 8% + employer 12%). The employer share is a deductible business cost; the employee share was withheld from staff salaries and is not the proprietor's own expense. EPF must be remitted on or before the last working day of the following month. Do NOT classify as the proprietor's personal income-tax deduction line -- it sits in the payroll-cost computation. FLAG to confirm the employer/employee split.
Source: EPF (CBSL) Employer FAQ -- https://epf.lk/?page_id=811

Classification: Payroll cost (employer share deductible). FLAG -- confirm employer vs employee split.

### Example 6 -- Full-year resident self-employed computation

Inputs (resident individual, YA 2025/2026):
Gross business income Rs. 4,000,000; allowable business expenses Rs. 1,200,000. No other income, no capital gains, no foreign-currency concession.

Step 1 -- Net profit (assessable income): 4,000,000 - 1,200,000 = Rs. 2,800,000.

Step 2 -- Apply personal relief: 2,800,000 - 1,800,000 = Rs. 1,000,000 taxable income.

Step 3 -- Apply slabs: taxable income Rs. 1,000,000 falls entirely in the first slab (first Rs. 1,000,000 @ 6%).
Tax = 1,000,000 x 6% = Rs. 60,000.

Classification: Taxable income Rs. 1,000,000; income tax due Rs. 60,000 (before any WHT/instalment credits).

### Example 7 -- Higher-income resident hitting multiple slabs

Inputs (resident individual, YA 2025/2026):
Net profit (after expenses) Rs. 5,300,000. No other income.

Step 1 -- Apply relief: 5,300,000 - 1,800,000 = Rs. 3,500,000 taxable income.

Step 2 -- Apply slabs:
- First 1,000,000 @ 6% = 60,000
- Next 500,000 @ 18% = 90,000 (cumulative 150,000)
- Next 500,000 @ 24% = 120,000 (cumulative 270,000)
- Next 500,000 @ 30% = 150,000 (cumulative 420,000)
- Remaining 1,000,000 (3,500,000 - 2,500,000) @ 36% = 360,000

Total = 420,000 + 360,000 = Rs. 780,000.

Classification: Taxable income Rs. 3,500,000; income tax due Rs. 780,000 (before credits).

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The wholly-and-exclusively / business-nexus test

- **Business-nexus test** — An expense is deductible only if incurred in producing the business income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis. Domestic/private expenses are not deductible.  _(Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 (deductions provisions))_

### 5.2 Income recognition

- **Income recognition** — All business income goes into assessable income. Where the individual is VAT-registered, report income net of the 18% VAT collected (VAT is a liability to IRD, not income). Employment income subject to APIT is included but reconciled against the APIT certificate (the APIT already deducted is a credit).

### 5.3 Personal relief

- **Personal relief application detail** — Deduct Rs. 1,800,000/year from assessable income before applying the slabs (residents and non-resident citizens only). Relief does NOT apply against investment-asset gains. Monthly equivalent Rs. 150,000 is used in APIT.  _(IRD PN/IT/2025-01 (26.03.2025))_

### 5.4 Capital allowances (depreciation)

- **Capital allowances research gap** — Capital assets are not fully expensed in year one; they are written off over time via capital allowances under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the current per-class capital-allowance rates and the depreciable-asset classes under IRA No. 24 of 2017 before applying any depreciation figure.] Until confirmed, flag every capital asset for reviewer treatment rather than guessing a rate.  _(Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017)_

### 5.5 Concessionary rates (apply only when conditions are met)

**Concessionary rates**  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026 -- https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/SitePages/tax_chart_2526.aspx?menuid=1404)_

| Income | Rate | Condition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Investment-asset gains | 10% | Realisation of an investment asset; relief does not apply |
| Foreign-source income remitted via a bank | max 15% | Remittance through a bank; documented |
| Foreign-currency service income via a bank | max 15% | Service income earned in / remitted via foreign currency through a bank |
| Betting & gaming, liquor, tobacco income | 45% | Specified activities |

### 5.6 Withholding / Advance Income Tax (AIT) credits

**WHT/AIT credits table**  _(IRD tax chart 2025/2026; taxadvisor.lk/ntri)_

| Income | Rate | Notes | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Interest & discount | 10% WHT/AIT | Up from 5% (1 Apr 2025). Individuals with total annual income below Rs. 1.8m may apply for exemption. For non-resident citizens, 10% on bank interest is a final tax. | IRD tax chart 2025/2026; taxadvisor.lk/ntri |
| Rent | 10% AIT | Where rent to a resident individual exceeds Rs. 100,000/month | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |
| Dividends | 15% final WHT | Resident companies to shareholders | IRD tax chart 2025/2026 |
| Non-resident payments | per DTAA | May be reduced under an applicable double-tax treaty | taxadvisor.lk/ntri |

- **WHT/AIT credit treatment** — WHT/AIT already deducted is a credit against the final income-tax liability (except where stated to be a final tax).

### 5.7 Non-deductible expenses

**Non-deductible expenses table**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment / private meals | Not in production of income |
| Personal living expenses, drawings | Private |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required) + Payroll Contributions

### 6.1 Home office deduction

- **Home office deduction rules** — - Calculate the proportion of the home used wholly for business (dedicated room / floor area). - Apply that percentage to rent, electricity (CEB/LECO), water (NWSDB), broadband. - A dual-use room does not qualify. Conservative default: 0% until reviewer confirms a dedicated workspace and basis. Flag for reviewer: confirm room/floor-area basis and that the space is genuinely dedicated.

### 6.2 Motor vehicle business use

- **Motor vehicle business use rules** — - Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance and depreciation is deductible. - Requires a mileage log. Conservative default: 0% business use until a log is provided. Flag for reviewer: confirm business percentage and capital-allowance rate (see Section 5.4 research gap).

### 6.3 EPF -- Employees' Provident Fund

- **EPF rules** — - Employee: 8% of total monthly earnings (withheld from salary). - Employer: 12% of total monthly earnings. - Total: 20%. No statutory salary ceiling/floor on the percentage (applies to "total earnings"). - Remit on or before the last working day of the following month. - Late surcharge (escalating on the contribution): 1-10 days 5%; 11 days-1 month 15%; 1-3 months 20%; 3-6 months 30%; 6-12 months 40%; over 12 months 50%. Plus 2% surcharge for incomplete details.  _(EPF (CBSL) Employer FAQ -- https://epf.lk/?page_id=811 ; CBSL -- https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/employees-provident-fund)_

### 6.4 ETF -- Employees' Trust Fund

- **ETF rules** — - Employer: 3% of total monthly earnings. Employee: nil -- the employer may not deduct ETF from the employee. - Remit on or before the last working day of the succeeding month. - Late surcharge: same escalating 5% -> 50% scale; late half-yearly returns add a 1% surcharge per delayed month on face value.  _(ETF Board Employers FAQ -- https://etfb.lk/employers-faq/)_

### 6.5 Gratuity

- **Gratuity rules** — - Payable on termination to employees with 5+ years of service, at half a month's salary per year of service. - Applies to employers with 15+ employees. [RESEARCH GAP -- exact formula and employee-count threshold taken from a secondary source (simplebooks.com); confirm against the Payment of Gratuity Act text before relying on it.]  _(Payment of Gratuity Act No. 12 of 1983)_

### 6.6 Foreign-currency / foreign-source concession (max 15%)

- **Foreign-currency concession rule** — The max-15% rate on foreign-source income, or service income earned in/remitted via foreign currency through a bank, depends on remittance routing and documentation. Conservative default: apply ordinary progressive rates and FLAG; do not auto-apply 15% (R-LK-4).

### 6.7 Bad debt write-off

- **Bad debt write-off rule** — Deductible only if the income was previously brought to account, recovery steps were taken, and the debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag for reviewer to confirm all three.

### APIT (Advance Personal Income Tax -- the PAYE-equivalent)

- **APIT definition** — APIT is the employer-deducted advance tax on employment income (replaced "PAYE"). Employers deduct monthly and remit to IRD. Monthly tax-free allowance Rs. 150,000 mirrors the annual Rs. 1,800,000 relief; the same 6%-36% slabs apply on a monthly-equivalent basis. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the per-row monthly APIT figures.] The IRD APIT Table 1 PDF could not be machine-extracted at authoring time. The monthly bands derive arithmetically from the annual slabs (relief Rs. 150,000/month; first Rs. 83,333/month at 6%, etc.), but the authoritative monthly cut-by-cut figures must be taken directly from the IRD Table 1 PDF.  _(IRD APIT Table 1 2025/2026 -- https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/APIT_Tax_Tables/2025-2026/Table%20-%201/02.%20APIT_2526_Table_01_Text.pdf ; IRD APIT Guideline 2025/2026 -- https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/APIT_Tax_Tables/2025-2026/Guide/APIT_2526_Guideline.pdf)_

### Test Suite

Test 1 -- Slab boundary, single slab.
Input: Resident, net profit Rs. 2,800,000, no other income.
Expected: relief 1,800,000 -> taxable 1,000,000; tax = 1,000,000 x 6% = Rs. 60,000.

Test 2 -- Multiple slabs.
Input: Resident, net profit Rs. 5,300,000.
Expected: taxable 3,500,000; tax = 60,000 + 90,000 + 120,000 + 150,000 + (1,000,000 x 36% = 360,000) = Rs. 780,000.

Test 3 -- Below relief, no tax.
Input: Resident, net profit Rs. 1,500,000.
Expected: 1,500,000 - 1,800,000 < 0 -> taxable Rs. 0; income tax = Rs. 0.

Test 4 -- Top slab reached exactly.
Input: Resident, net profit Rs. 4,300,000 -> taxable 2,500,000.
Expected: cumulative tax at top of 30% slab = Rs. 420,000; nothing in the 36% band; tax = Rs. 420,000.

Test 5 -- Interest gross-up with WHT credit.
Input: FD interest credited net Rs. 90,000 (10% WHT withheld).
Expected: gross = 90,000 / 0.90 = Rs. 100,000; WHT credit Rs. 10,000 against liability (or final tax if non-resident citizen).

Test 6 -- EPF/ETF employer on-cost.
Input: Monthly gross payroll Rs. 1,000,000 for staff.
Expected: EPF employer 12% = Rs. 120,000; ETF employer 3% = Rs. 30,000; employer on-cost = Rs. 150,000 (15%). Employee EPF 8% = Rs. 80,000 withheld from staff. Total contributions remitted relating to EPF = Rs. 200,000 (20%).

Test 7 -- Foreign-currency concession FLAG.
Input: Payoneer service payout Rs. 480,000 to a freelancer.
Expected: include as business income at progressive rates by default; FLAG for reviewer to assess the max-15% foreign-currency-service concession. Do NOT auto-apply 15%.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the Rs. 1,800,000 personal relief to a non-citizen non-resident, or against investment-asset gains.
- NEVER auto-apply the max-15% foreign-currency / foreign-source concession -- it requires reviewer confirmation of remittance routing.
- NEVER fully expense a capital asset -- it is recovered via capital allowances (and the rate is a [RESEARCH GAP] pending confirmation).
- NEVER treat EPF/ETF as the proprietor's personal income-tax deduction without separating employer vs employee share.
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales as income for a VAT-registered person.
- NEVER allow entertainment, fines/penalties, drawings, or income tax itself as a deduction.
- NEVER reproduce the monthly APIT table figures as authoritative -- they are a [RESEARCH GAP] until taken from the IRD Table 1 PDF.
- NEVER use current-year income for instalments without reconciling to the Statement of Estimated Tax.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated, pending reviewer sign-off.
