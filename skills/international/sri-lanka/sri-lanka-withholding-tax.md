### Conservative defaults

**Conservative defaults (ambiguity table)**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Payment type unclear | Apply the rate for the most specific matching category; if still unclear, flag |
| Resident vs non-resident recipient unconfirmed | Treat as non-resident (14%) and flag |
| Rent/service-fee monthly threshold borderline | Apply WHT if aggregate exceeds LKR 100,000/month |
| Self-declaration for interest relief claimed | Require the recipient's declaration on file; else withhold 10% |

- **Payment type unclear** — Apply the rate for the most specific matching category; if still unclear, flag
- **Resident vs non-resident recipient unconfirmed** — Treat as non-resident (14%) and flag
- **Rent/service-fee monthly threshold borderline** — Apply WHT if aggregate exceeds LKR 100,000/month
- **Self-declaration for interest relief claimed** — Require the recipient's declaration on file; else withhold 10%

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

Payer identity & TIN; recipient legal name, TIN, and **residency status**; nature of payment (interest, dividend, rent, service fee, royalty); gross amount and period; any self-declaration for relief (interest); for non-residents, treaty residence certificate where treaty relief is claimed.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-LK-WHT-1 — APIT / PAYE on employment** — Employment withholding is APIT, not this AIT regime — use `sri-lanka-income-tax` / `sri-lanka-payroll`.  _(R-LK-WHT-1)_
- **R-LK-WHT-2 — Treaty rate claim without a residence certificate** — Apply the statutory non-resident rate; do not apply a treaty cap without the certificate. Escalate treaty analysis.  _(R-LK-WHT-2)_
- **R-LK-WHT-3 — Sector special regimes (banking, insurance, capital markets)** — Out of scope — escalate.  _(R-LK-WHT-3)_
- **R-LK-WHT-4 — VAT / SSCL withholding** — Different regimes — use `sri-lanka-vat` / `sri-lanka-sscl`.  _(R-LK-WHT-4)_

## Section 3 — Tier 1 rules

### 3.1 Interest or discount — 10%

- **Interest or discount** — 10%  _(IRD tax chart YA 2025/26; PN/IT/2025-01; IRD Circulars SEC/2025/E/02 and SEC/2025/E/03)_
- **Interest/discount deduction and self-declaration relief** — Deduct 10% on interest or discount paid (raised from 5% effective 1 April 2025). A resident individual whose assessable income does not exceed the LKR 1,800,000 personal relief may self-declare to the payer to reduce/avoid the deduction — require the declaration on file.  _(IRD tax chart YA 2025/26; PN/IT/2025-01; IRD Circulars SEC/2025/E/02 and SEC/2025/E/03)_

### 3.2 Dividends — 15%

- **Dividends** — 15%  _(Section 3.2 Dividends — 15%)_

### 3.3 Resident rent — 10%

- **Resident rent** — 10%  _(Section 3.3 Resident rent — 10%)_
- **Resident rent monthly threshold** — LKR 100,000 per calendar month  _(Section 3.3 Resident rent — 10%)_

### 3.4 Resident service fees — 5%

- **Resident service fees** — 5%  _(Section 3.4 Resident service fees — 5%)_
- **Resident service fee aggregate threshold** — LKR 100,000 per month aggregate  _(Section 3.4 Resident service fees — 5%)_

### 3.5 Royalties — 14%

- **Royalties** — 14%  _(Section 3.5 Royalties — 14%)_

### 3.6 Non-residents — 14%

- **Non-resident rent, service fees, insurance premiums** — 14%  _(Section 3.6 Non-residents — 14%)_
- **Non-resident treaty cap condition** — Subject to any applicable double-tax treaty cap, which requires a residence certificate.  _(Section 3.6 Non-residents — 14%)_

## Section 4 — Tier 2

- **Credit / final tax** — AIT deducted is generally creditable against the recipient's income tax. Whether a given deduction is creditable vs final depends on the recipient and payment type — VERIFY per the IRA for each stream.
- **Self-declaration mechanics (interest)** — The relief self-declaration is recipient-specific and time-bound; the payer must hold it before applying a reduced/zero deduction.
- **Treaty relief** — Reduced rates for non-residents require a tax-residence certificate and beneficial-ownership confirmation — escalate.

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### 5.1 Interest paid to a resident company

- **AIT on interest to resident company** — AIT = 10% × 1,000,000 = LKR 100,000 withheld and remitted; recipient credits it.  _(Section 5.1 Interest paid to a resident company)_

### 5.2 Resident rent above threshold

- **AIT on resident rent above threshold** — Company pays LKR 150,000/month rent to a resident landlord (> LKR 100,000) → AIT = 10% × 150,000 = LKR 15,000/month.  _(Section 5.2 Resident rent above threshold)_

### 5.3 Service fee to a non-resident consultant

- **AIT on service fee to non-resident consultant** — Payment LKR 2,000,000 to a non-resident for services → AIT = 14% × 2,000,000 = LKR 280,000 (subject to any treaty cap with a residence certificate).  _(Section 5.3 Service fee to a non-resident consultant)_

## Section 6 — Filing and payment

- **Deduction and remittance mechanics** — AIT is deducted at the time of payment and remitted to the IRD, with a withholding certificate issued to the recipient.

Remittance and statement due dates — VERIFY against the current IRD WHT/AIT schedule (not asserted here).

## Section 7 — Conservative defaults

| Situation | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Residency unconfirmed | Non-resident 14%; flag |
