## Sri Lanka Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — research-verified, pending accountant sign-off.** Figures below are current for Sri Lanka's **Year of Assessment 2025/2026 (1 April 2025 – 31 March 2026)**. The personal relief and APIT Table 01 monthly formula are extracted verbatim from the Inland Revenue Department (IRD) primary PDF; the EPF/ETF rates are from official EPF/ETF/Central Bank sources. APIT penalty amounts are corroborated from reputable Sri Lankan tax-advisory summaries of the Inland Revenue Act and carry a flag. Do not present any computation as definitive until a Sri Lanka-qualified tax practitioner (CA Sri Lanka member or equivalent) has signed off.

## Section 2 — Income Tax Withholding (APIT)

The employer withholds APIT **monthly** under the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 (as amended) and remits to the IRD. Sri Lanka has a genuine personal income tax; this is **not** a no-PIT jurisdiction. The monthly withholding uses **APIT Table 01** for resident employees and Sri Lankan-citizen non-residents on primary employment. The personal relief of **LKR 150,000/month** has already been baked into the Table 01 formula (the "− subtract" term restores it).

> **Which APIT table applies.** Table 01 covers resident employees and non-resident **Sri Lankan citizens** with a single (primary) employment; deduction is **compulsory regardless of employee consent**. Other tables exist for other situations — see Section 11. When the employee's category is unclear, refuse and ask (Refusal Catalogue, Section 7).

### 2.1 Annual progressive rate schedule (Y/A 2025/2026)

**Annual progressive rate schedule (Y/A 2025/2026)**  _(Source: IRD APIT 2025/2026 guideline — https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/APIT_Tax_Tables/2025-2026/Guide/APIT_2526_Guideline.pdf)_

| Annual taxable income band (LKR) | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| First 1,000,000 | 6% |
| Next 500,000 | 18% |
| Next 500,000 | 24% |
| Next 500,000 | 30% |
| Balance | 36% |

### 2.2 Monthly APIT Table 01 — exact formula (Y/A 2025/2026)

**Monthly APIT Table 01 — exact formula (Y/A 2025/2026)**  _(Source (verbatim from IRD): https://www.ird.gov.lk/en/publications/APIT_Tax_Tables/2025-2026/Table%20-%201/02.%20APIT_2526_Table_01_Text.pdf)_

| Monthly regular profits (LKR) | Monthly APIT |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 150,000 | Nil (relief) |
| 150,001 – 233,333 | **6% × gross − 9,000** |
| 233,334 – 275,000 | **18% × gross − 37,000** |
| 275,001 – 316,667 | **24% × gross − 53,500** |
| 316,668 – 358,333 | **30% × gross − 72,500** |
| Over 358,333 | **36% × gross − 94,000** |

"Monthly regular profits from employment" = gross monthly employment income, including non-cash benefits (Section 2.4). Apply the row that contains the gross figure.

**Band-boundary / cumulative-tax anchors (recomputed):**
- Relief LKR 150,000/month corresponds to annual relief 1,800,000. First annual band 1,000,000 ÷ 12 = 83,333.33 → gross top of 6% band = 150,000 + 83,333.33 = **233,333** ✓
- At gross 233,333: 6% × 233,333 − 9,000 = 13,999.98 − 9,000 = **≈5,000** ✓ (= 6% × 83,333 taxable)
- At gross 275,000 (top of 18% band): 18% × 275,000 − 37,000 = 49,500 − 37,000 = **12,500** ✓
- At gross 316,667 (top of 24% band): 24% × 316,667 − 53,500 = 76,000 − 53,500 = **≈22,500** ✓
- At gross 358,333 (top of 30% band): 30% × 358,333 − 72,500 = 107,500 − 72,500 = **≈35,000** ✓
- Just above 358,333 (36% band): 36% × 358,333 − 94,000 = 129,000 − 94,000 = **≈35,000** ✓ (continuous — the two formulas meet at the boundary)

Each "− subtract" constant reconciles to the lower-band cumulative tax, so the schedule is continuous at every boundary.

### 2.3 No tax-free relief beyond LKR 150,000/month

- **Personal relief limit** — The relief is **LKR 150,000/month** (LKR 1,800,000/year). It is built into the formula; do **not** subtract it a second time. Gross at or below 150,000/month attracts **nil** APIT under Table 01.  _(IRD APIT Table 01 (states "Rs. 150,000.00 per month as personal relief has already been deducted"))_

### 2.4 Regular profits from employment include

- **Regular profits from employment** — Wages, salary, commission, overtime, travel and other allowances, fees, pension; non-cash benefits (housing, conveyance, electricity, telephone, entertainment, etc., at fair market value); medical bills/insurance (with a limited exemption where dental/medical/health insurance is available to all full-time employees on equal terms); third-party payments made for the employee's benefit. Only Third Schedule exemptions (Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017, as amended) apply.  _(IRD APIT Table 01)_

## Section 3 — EPF (Employees' Provident Fund)

EPF is governed by the **Employees' Provident Fund Act No. 15 of 1958**. Contributions are computed on **total monthly earnings** with **no floor and no ceiling**. The statutory rates are minimums — an employer may contribute more.

### 3.1 EPF contribution rates (Y/A 2025/2026)

**EPF contribution rates (Y/A 2025/2026)**  _(Sources: EPF Act — https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/laws/acts/en/epf_act.pdf ; EPF Employer FAQ — https://epf.lk/?page_id=811 ; Central Bank EPF — https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/en/employees-provident-fund)_

| Party | Rate | Base |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | **8%** (deducted from pay) | Total monthly earnings |
| Employer | **12%** | Total monthly earnings |
| **Total** | **20%** | Total monthly earnings |

**Arithmetic self-check:** employee 8% + employer 12% = **20% total** ✓

### 3.2 EPF "total earnings" base

**EPF total earnings base**  _(EPF Employer FAQ)_

| Treatment | Items |
| --- | --- |
| **Included** | Salary/wages/fees; cost-of-living and special living allowances; holiday payments; cash value of food supplied by the employer; food allowances; commissions; piece-rate / contract payments — *EPF Employer FAQ* |
| **Excluded** | Overtime pay; reimbursable travelling expenses; incentive / bonus payments — *EPF Employer FAQ* |

- **EPF base ≠ APIT base** — APIT (Section 2) is computed on full regular profits including overtime and many allowances; the EPF base **excludes** overtime, reimbursed travel and bonuses. Compute the two bases separately; never reuse the gross figure blindly.  _(EPF Employer FAQ)_

### 3.3 Coverage and deadline

**Coverage and deadline**  _(EPF Employer FAQ; EPF Act)_

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Mandatory scope | Any employer with **one or more employees** — EPF applies from the first covered employee; no minimum headcount — *EPF Employer FAQ* |
| Ceiling | **None** — 20% applies to full total earnings — *EPF Act* |
| Floor | **None** identified beyond actual wage — *EPF Employer FAQ* |
| Payment deadline | On or before the **last working day of the following month** — *EPF Employer FAQ* |

## Section 4 — ETF (Employees' Trust Fund)

ETF is governed by the **Employees' Trust Fund Act No. 46 of 1980** (fund established 1 March 1981) and administered by the ETF Board. It is **employer-only**.

**ETF rates**  _(ETF Act No. 46 of 1980; ETF Board payment page — https://etfb.lk/payment-of-contributions/ ; ETF Employers FAQ — https://etfb.lk/employers-faq/)_

| Party | Rate | Base |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employer | **3%** | Total monthly earnings |
| Employee | **0%** — no employee contribution; must **NOT** be deducted from employee pay | — |

**ETF mandatory scope and deadline**  _(ETF Employers FAQ; ETF Board)_

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Mandatory scope | Any employer with one or more employees — *ETF Employers FAQ* |
| Payment deadline | On or before the **last working day of the following month** — *ETF Board* |

- **Combined employer social cost** — > **Combined employer social cost.** Employer bears **15%** of earnings (12% EPF + 3% ETF); employee bears **8%** (EPF only). Total paid into the two funds = **23%** (20% EPF + 3% ETF). **Arithmetic self-check:** 12% + 3% = 15% employer ✓; 15% employer + 8% employee = 23% total ✓.

## Section 5 — Minimum Wage

**Minimum wage table**  _(Ministry of Labour — https://labourmin.gov.lk/heres-how-the-private-sector-minimum-wage-is-set-to-rise/ ; National Minimum Wage of Workers (Amendment) Act No. 11 of 2025 — https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/acts/gbills/english/6388.pdf ; Daily Mirror (gazette report) — https://www.dailymirror.lk/breaking-news/Govt-announces-Rs-27-000-minimum-monthly-wage-in-gazette-from-April-1/108-309443)_

| Rule | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| National Minimum Monthly Wage (private sector) | **LKR 27,000/month** (effective 1 Apr 2025; raised from LKR 21,000) — *Ministry of Labour; Amendment Act No. 11 of 2025* |
| National Minimum Daily Wage | **LKR 1,080/day** (raised from LKR 700) — *Ministry of Labour; Amendment Act No. 11 of 2025* |
| Budgetary Relief Allowances (BRA) | Consolidated into the LKR 27,000 figure for 2025 — **no separate BRA add-on** — *Ministry of Labour* |
| From 1 January 2026 | Further increase to **LKR 30,000/month** — *Ministry of Labour; Amendment Act No. 11 of 2025* |

- **Implication for payroll** — **Implication for payroll:** there **is** a binding wage floor (LKR 27,000/month for Y/A 2025/2026; LKR 30,000/month from 1 Jan 2026). Flag any monthly gross below the floor.  _(Ministry of Labour; Amendment Act No. 11 of 2025)_

## Section 6 — Conservative Defaults

When a required input is ambiguous and the user cannot supply it, apply the **most conservative** assumption (the one that maximises tax/contribution exposure or that forces a refusal), and label the output as provisional.

**Conservative defaults table**

| Unknown | Conservative default | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which APIT table applies | Use **Table 01** ONLY if primary-employment / single-employer is confirmed; otherwise refuse and ask | Tables 02–08 apply to arrears, terminal payments, secondary employment, mid-year joiners — different formulas |
| Whether a payment is "regular profits" for APIT | **Include** it in the APIT gross | APIT base is broad; over-withholding is recoverable, under-withholding makes the employer personally liable (Section 124) |
| Whether a payment is in the EPF "total earnings" base | **Include** unless it is overtime, reimbursed travel or a bonus | Those three are the named exclusions; everything else is in |
| Whether ETF applies | Assume **yes** (3% employer) for any covered employee | ETF has no headcount threshold |
| Pay frequency | **Monthly** | Standard Sri Lanka practice |
| Currency | **LKR** | Only legal payroll currency |
| Gross below the minimum wage | **Flag** as below LKR 27,000/month floor (LKR 30,000 from 1 Jan 2026) | A binding floor exists |
| Residence / citizenship for table selection | Refuse and ask | Table 01 covers residents and Sri Lankan-citizen non-residents only |

## Section 7 — Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

### 7.1 Minimum required inputs

- **Minimum required inputs** — To compute Sri Lanka payroll for one employee for one month, you MUST have: 1. **Gross monthly regular profits** (in LKR) for APIT. 2. **Total monthly earnings** for EPF/ETF (may differ from APIT gross — exclude overtime, reimbursed travel, bonuses). 3. **Employee category** confirming **Table 01** applies (resident or Sri Lankan-citizen non-resident; single/primary employment). 4. **Month of pay** (to set remittance deadlines). 5. Confirmation of whether any allowance/benefit is exempt (Third Schedule) or excluded from the EPF base.

### 7.2 Refusal Catalogue — REFUSE and ask if any of these hold

**Refusal Catalogue**

| Situation | Why refuse |
| --- | --- |
| APIT table / employment category not stated | Tables 01–08 have different formulas; never assume Table 01 silently |
| Currency given is not LKR | Payroll must be in LKR; silent FX conversion introduces error |
| Lump-sum / arrears / terminal payment present | These use Table 02/03, not the monthly Table 01 formula |
| APIT gross and EPF base conflated as one number | The bases differ (overtime, travel, bonus excluded from EPF) |
| Employee may have a second employment | Secondary employment uses a different table |
| Non-resident who is **not** a Sri Lankan citizen | Table 01 does not apply; different withholding rules |
| Asked to treat the result as final/filed advice | This is a Tier 2 skill pending sign-off |
| Asked to confirm exact APIT penalty figures as statute | Penalty amounts are flagged — see Section 16 |

When refusing, state the missing input plainly and request it. Do not fabricate.

## Section 8 — Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic mapping of Sri Lankan bank-statement narrations to payroll classifications. Match case-insensitively; longer/more specific patterns win. Statements are commonly in English; banks include Bank of Ceylon (BOC), People's Bank, Commercial Bank (Combank), Hatton National Bank (HNB) and Sampath Bank. Sinhala/Tamil narrations occasionally appear.

### 8.1 Salary credits (employee side)

**Salary credits (employee side)**

| Narration pattern | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `SALARY`, `SAL`, `PAY`, `NET SALARY`, `WAGES` | Net salary credit |
| `EMPLOYER [name] TRANSFER`, `STAFF SAL` | Net salary credit |
| `වැටුප` (Sinhala "salary"), `சம்பளம்` (Tamil "salary") | Net salary credit |
| `BONUS`, `INCENTIVE` | Supplement — taxable for APIT, **excluded** from EPF base |
| `OT`, `OVERTIME` | Overtime — taxable for APIT, **excluded** from EPF base |
| `EPF REFUND`, `ETF REFUND` | Fund adjustment — not income |

### 8.2 Employer debit patterns (remittances)

**Employer debit patterns (remittances)**

| Narration pattern | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `IRD APIT`, `APIT`, `PAYE`, `IRD PAYMENT` | APIT remittance to IRD |
| `EPF`, `EPF CONTRIBUTION`, `EPF 20%`, `PROVIDENT FUND` | EPF contribution (8% employee + 12% employer) |
| `ETF`, `ETF BOARD`, `TRUST FUND` | ETF contribution (3% employer-only) |
| `NET WAGES`, `PAYROLL`, `SALARY BATCH`, `STAFF SALARIES` | Net salary disbursement to employees |
| `SLIPS`, `PAYMENT VOUCHER IRD` | IRD payment voucher reference — tax remittance |

> **EPF vs ETF note:** an EPF remittance is 20% of the EPF base (8% deducted from staff + 12% employer); an ETF remittance is 3% employer-only. If a single line is labelled "EPF/ETF 23%", split it 20/3 before posting.

## Section 9 — Worked Examples

All examples use **APIT Table 01** (Section 2.2), **EPF 8%/12%** (Section 3.1) and **ETF 3%** (Section 4). For simplicity each example assumes the EPF base equals the APIT gross (i.e. no overtime/bonus); where overtime or a bonus exists, the EPF base would be lower — see the note after Example 6. Every figure recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 — Minimum-wage earner (gross LKR 27,000/month)

Statement line: `STAFF SAL EMP001 ... 24,840`

- **APIT:** 27,000 ≤ 150,000 → **LKR 0** (relief)
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 27,000 = **LKR 2,160**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 27,000 = **LKR 3,240**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 27,000 = **LKR 810**
- **Net pay:** 27,000 − 0 − 2,160 = **LKR 24,840**
- **Total employer cost:** 27,000 + 3,240 + 810 = **LKR 31,050**

*Cross-check vs statement: net 24,840 matches the narration ✓.*

### Example 2 — At the personal relief (gross LKR 150,000/month)

- **APIT:** 150,000 = top of the Nil band → **LKR 0**
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 150,000 = **LKR 12,000**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 150,000 = **LKR 18,000**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 150,000 = **LKR 4,500**
- **Net pay:** 150,000 − 0 − 12,000 = **LKR 138,000**
- **Total employer cost:** 150,000 + 18,000 + 4,500 = **LKR 172,500**

### Example 3 — First APIT band, 6% (gross LKR 200,000/month)

- **APIT:** 200,000 in band 150,001–233,333 → 6% × 200,000 − 9,000 = 12,000 − 9,000 = **LKR 3,000**
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 200,000 = **LKR 16,000**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 200,000 = **LKR 24,000**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 200,000 = **LKR 6,000**
- **Net pay:** 200,000 − 3,000 − 16,000 = **LKR 181,000**
- **Total employer cost:** 200,000 + 24,000 + 6,000 = **LKR 230,000**

### Example 4 — 24% band (gross LKR 300,000/month)

- **APIT:** 300,000 in band 275,001–316,667 → 24% × 300,000 − 53,500 = 72,000 − 53,500 = **LKR 18,500**
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 300,000 = **LKR 24,000**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 300,000 = **LKR 36,000**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 300,000 = **LKR 9,000**
- **Net pay:** 300,000 − 18,500 − 24,000 = **LKR 257,500**
- **Total employer cost:** 300,000 + 36,000 + 9,000 = **LKR 345,000**

### Example 5 — Top APIT band, 36% (gross LKR 500,000/month)

- **APIT:** 500,000 > 358,333 → 36% × 500,000 − 94,000 = 180,000 − 94,000 = **LKR 86,000**
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 500,000 = **LKR 40,000**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 500,000 = **LKR 60,000**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 500,000 = **LKR 15,000**
- **Net pay:** 500,000 − 86,000 − 40,000 = **LKR 374,000**
- **Total employer cost:** 500,000 + 60,000 + 15,000 = **LKR 575,000**

### Example 6 — 18% band (gross LKR 250,000/month)

- **APIT:** 250,000 in band 233,334–275,000 → 18% × 250,000 − 37,000 = 45,000 − 37,000 = **LKR 8,000**
- **EPF employee (8%):** 8% × 250,000 = **LKR 20,000**
- **EPF employer (12%):** 12% × 250,000 = **LKR 30,000**
- **ETF employer (3%):** 3% × 250,000 = **LKR 7,500**
- **Net pay:** 250,000 − 8,000 − 20,000 = **LKR 222,000**
- **Total employer cost:** 250,000 + 30,000 + 7,500 = **LKR 287,500**

> **Overtime/bonus illustration.** If Example 4's LKR 300,000 comprised LKR 270,000 regular + LKR 30,000 overtime, APIT still applies to the full 300,000 (overtime is regular profits for APIT) → LKR 18,500, but the **EPF/ETF base** would be **270,000**: EPF employee 8% × 270,000 = 21,600; EPF employer 32,400; ETF 8,100. Always split the two bases.

## Section 10 — Tier 1 Rules (deterministic, always apply)

- **Tier 1 Rules** — 1. APIT is computed on **gross monthly regular profits** using **Table 01** (Section 2.2) for resident / Sri Lankan-citizen-non-resident primary employment. 2. The personal relief is **LKR 150,000/month**, already built into the Table 01 formula — never deduct it twice. 3. EPF = **8% employee + 12% employer = 20%** of **total earnings** (Section 3.1), **no floor, no ceiling**. 4. ETF = **3% employer-only** of total earnings (Section 4) — **never** deduct ETF from the employee. 5. The **EPF/ETF base excludes** overtime, reimbursed travel and bonuses; the **APIT base includes** them. Compute the two bases separately. 6. Currency is **LKR** only. 7. APIT is remitted by the **15th of the following month**; EPF and ETF by the **last working day of the following month**. 8. The minimum monthly wage is **LKR 27,000** (LKR 30,000 from 1 Jan 2026) — flag any gross below it. 9. Every output is labelled **provisional / pending accountant sign-off**.

## Section 11 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

**Tier 2 Catalogue**

| Item | Why it needs judgement |
| --- | --- |
| Selection between APIT Tables 01–08 | Lump-sum (Table 02), terminal (Table 03), mid-year joiner/retiree or sub-threshold-but-annual-over-1.8M (Table 05), Table 08 categories — fact-specific |
| Valuation of non-cash benefits (housing, vehicle, utilities) | Fair-market-value rules under the Inland Revenue Act not fully encoded here |
| Whether a medical/insurance benefit qualifies for the equal-terms exemption | Conditional on all full-time staff being covered on equal terms |
| Third Schedule exemptions | Item-by-item statutory analysis |
| Residence / citizenship for table eligibility | Non-Sri-Lankan-citizen non-residents fall outside Table 01 |
| Whether a specific allowance sits in the EPF base | The named exclusions are overtime, reimbursed travel and bonuses; edge cases need judgement |

Suggested column layout for a monthly Sri Lanka payroll working paper (one row per employee):

**Excel Working Paper Template columns**

| Col | Header | Formula / source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Employee name | input |
| B | TIN | input |
| C | APIT table (confirm 01) | input |
| D | APIT gross / regular profits (LKR) | input |
| E | EPF/ETF base — total earnings (LKR) | input (exclude OT, reimbursed travel, bonus) |
| F | APIT band applied | lookup on D |
| G | APIT (LKR) | Table 01 formula (Section 2.2) |
| H | EPF employee 8% (LKR) | `=ROUND(E*0.08,2)` |
| I | EPF employer 12% (LKR) | `=ROUND(E*0.12,2)` |
| J | ETF employer 3% (LKR) | `=ROUND(E*0.03,2)` |
| K | Net pay (LKR) | `=D-G-H` |
| L | Total employer cost (LKR) | `=D+I+J` |
| M | Remittance month | APIT 15th; EPF/ETF last working day |

- **APIT Table 01 formula (Excel)** — =IF(D<=150000,0, IF(D<=233333,D*0.06-9000, IF(D<=275000,D*0.18-37000, IF(D<=316667,D*0.24-53500, IF(D<=358333,D*0.30-72500, D*0.36-94000)))))  _(Section 2.2)_

Reconcile column G against the worked examples before relying on the sheet. Note: K subtracts APIT and EPF employee only; ETF and EPF employer are employer costs (column L), not employee deductions.

## Section 14 — Onboarding Fallback

- **Onboarding fallback questions** — If you lack a required input and cannot proceed, ask the user the following, in order, and stop until answered: 1. "Does **APIT Table 01** apply — is the employee a **resident or Sri Lankan-citizen non-resident** on a **single/primary** employment?" 2. "What are the employee's **gross monthly regular profits in LKR** (for APIT)?" 3. "What is the **total-earnings base for EPF/ETF** — does it differ from the APIT gross (overtime, reimbursed travel and bonuses are excluded from EPF)?" 4. "Which **month** is this pay run for (sets the remittance deadlines)?" 5. "Are any allowances or benefits **exempt (Third Schedule)** or excluded from the EPF base?" Do not estimate around a missing APIT table category or gross figure. Do not deduct ETF from the employee under any circumstance.

## Section 19 — Test Suite

Each test states inputs and the expected output; recompute before trusting any change to this skill. EPF base = APIT gross unless stated; APIT from Section 2.2, EPF/ETF from Sections 3–4.

**Gross 27,000 (minimum wage).** Expect APIT = **0**; EPF emp = 2,160; ETF emp = 0; net = **24,840**; employer cost = 31,050. *(See Example 1.)*

**Gross 150,000 (at relief).** Expect APIT = **0**; EPF emp = 12,000; net = **138,000**; employer cost = 172,500. *(See Example 2.)*

**Gross 200,000.** Expect APIT = 6% × 200,000 − 9,000 = **3,000**; EPF emp = 16,000; net = **181,000**. *(See Example 3.)*

**Gross 250,000.** Expect APIT = 18% × 250,000 − 37,000 = **8,000**; EPF emp = 20,000; net = **222,000**. *(See Example 6.)*

**Gross 300,000.** Expect APIT = 24% × 300,000 − 53,500 = **18,500**; EPF emp = 24,000; net = **257,500**. *(See Example 4.)*

**Gross 500,000.** Expect APIT = 36% × 500,000 − 94,000 = **86,000**; EPF emp = 40,000; net = **374,000**. *(See Example 5.)*

**EPF/ETF total check, any base B.** Expect EPF employer 12% + employee 8% = **20% of B**; ETF employer = **3% of B**; total to funds = **23% of B**; no ceiling.

**ETF deducted from employee.** Expect: **refuse / flag** — ETF is employer-only (0% employee); never deduct from pay.

**Gross 300,000 with 30,000 overtime.** Expect APIT on full 300,000 = **18,500**; EPF base = 270,000 → EPF emp = 21,600, EPF er = 32,400, ETF = 8,100. *(See note after Example 6.)*

**Lump-sum / terminal payment.** Expect: **refuse / flag** — use Table 02/03, not the monthly Table 01 formula.

**Gross 26,000 below minimum wage.** Expect: **flag** as below the LKR 27,000/month floor; APIT still 0 (≤150,000).

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Table 01 residency/employment condition** — NEVER apply Table 01 without confirming the employee is a resident or Sri Lankan-citizen non-resident on a single/primary employment — other categories use different tables.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **ETF employee deduction prohibition** — NEVER deduct ETF from the employee — it is a 3% employer-only contribution.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Double relief prohibition** — NEVER subtract the LKR 150,000 personal relief a second time — it is already inside the Table 01 formula.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **APIT gross as EPF base without checks** — NEVER reuse the APIT gross as the EPF base without checking for overtime, reimbursed travel and bonuses (which are excluded from EPF).  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **EPF/ETF ceiling or floor prohibition** — NEVER apply a ceiling or floor to EPF/ETF — the percentages apply to full total earnings.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Currency restriction** — NEVER compute payroll in any currency other than LKR.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Penalty figures not confirmed statute** — NEVER treat the APIT penalty figures as confirmed statute — they are flagged [RESEARCH GAP].  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Deadline flagging requirement** — NEVER miss the 15th-of-following-month APIT deadline or the last-working-day EPF/ETF deadline without flagging penalty exposure.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Minimum wage ignoring prohibition** — NEVER ignore the LKR 27,000/month minimum wage (LKR 30,000 from 1 Jan 2026) when a gross falls below it.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
- **Definitive computation prohibition** — NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Sri Lanka-qualified tax practitioner.  _(PROHIBITIONS section)_
