**Regime note.** The 2025 tax year and earlier follow the long-standing CIRPS. **Law No. 11/2025** (29 Dec 2025) enters into force **1 January 2026**: it does not change the rate brackets but redefines residency, abolishes simplified/exemption regimes, ends the employee filing waiver, and adds digital-service withholding.

### IRPS Rate Brackets (Resident -- 2025, continuing under 2026 reform)

Progressive scale on **annual** taxable income. Mechanism: **tax = (annual income × bracket rate) − deductible amount (parcela a abater)** for the bracket.

| Annual taxable income (MZN) | Rate | Deductible amount (parcela a abater, MZN) | Cumulative tax at bracket top (MZN) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 42,000 | 10% | 0 | 4,200 |
| 42,000 -- 168,000 | 15% | 2,100 | 23,100 |
| 168,000 -- 504,000 | 20% | 10,500 | 90,300 |
| 504,000 -- 1,512,000 | 25% | 37,500 | 340,500 |
| Over 1,512,000 | 32% | 141,540 | -- |

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/taxes-on-personal-income (last reviewed 04 Mar 2026); AT IRPS rate page — https://www.at.gov.mz/por/Comercio-Internacional/Procedimento-Fiscais/Taxas-IRPS (AT page returned a TLS error to the fetcher; PwC corroborates the same schedule).

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The published deductible amounts for the 25% bracket (MZN 37,500) and 32% bracket (MZN 141,540) do not produce perfectly continuous brackets (strict continuity would require 35,700 and 143,340 respectively). The published "parcela a abater" values are the figures AT applies and are used in this skill as authoritative; reviewer to verify against the official CIRPS schedule. The cumulative-tax column above is computed using the **published** deductible amounts.

**Non-residents:** flat **20%** withholding on Mozambique-source income (including employment). Source: PwC — same page.

### INSS Social Security Contributions

| Party | Rate of monthly salary |
|---|---|
| Employee | 3% |
| Employer | 4% |
| **Total** | **7%** |

Base: all salaries, wages, regular bonuses and other regular income; **meal subsidy excluded**. No contribution ceiling identified from authoritative sources (state explicitly: **no ceiling found**). Employer withholds the employee's 3% and remits the full 7%. Source: PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/other-taxes ; INSS — https://www.inss.gov.mz/duvidas/

**Arithmetic check:** employee 3% + employer 4% = total 7%. ✓

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency | STOP -- residency determines whole-scale vs 20% flat; do not compute |
| Unknown income category (1st vs 2nd) | STOP -- ask before classifying |
| Unknown whether item is "regular income" for INSS | Treat as INSIDE the INSS base (only meal subsidy is confirmed excluded) |
| Unknown number of dependents | 0 dependents (no dependent deduction) |
| Unknown ISPC vs organized accounting | Organized accounting (ISPC abolished from 2026 — see Section 5) |
| Unknown expense business-use % (2nd category) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown INSS payment deadline | Use the earlier INSS-site date (10th of following month) — see Section 6 |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- residency status (resident / non-resident), income category (1st = employment, 2nd = business/self-employment), and either a payroll summary (employment) or a bank statement for the full tax year (self-employment), plus number of dependents.

**Recommended** -- monthly PAYE withholding records, INSS contribution records, all invoices/receipts (2nd category), prior-year Modelo 10 or assessment.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account with organized accounting, advance-payment (pagamentos por conta) confirmations, double-taxation relief documentation.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No income evidence at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices (2nd category) = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions are supported by organized-accounting records."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-MZ-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether the progressive 10%–32% scale or the flat 20% non-resident rate applies, and Law 11/2025 redefined residency from 2026. This skill cannot compute IRPS without residency status. Confirm before proceeding."

**R-MZ-2 -- Companies / IRPC.** "This skill covers individuals (IRPS) only. Corporate income tax (IRPC) is a separate regime. Escalate to a Mozambican tax professional."

**R-MZ-3 -- Non-resident complex source rules.** "Non-resident source-of-income and treaty questions require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a Mozambican tax professional."

**R-MZ-4 -- Capital gains.** "Capital gains under the new autonomous regime (Art. 54-A, from 2026) require specialised analysis. Escalate to a Mozambican tax professional."

**R-MZ-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to AT enforcement. Default interest (juros de mora) accrues immediately and statutory fines apply. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-MZ-6 -- VAT (IVA) requested.** "This skill covers IRPS only. Mozambique VAT (IVA) is a separate skill."

**R-MZ-7 -- 2026 mechanics not yet regulated.** "Law 11/2025 grants the government 180 days to issue implementing regulations. Some 2026 mechanics (e.g. survival of personal/dependent deductions) are pending. Flag and escalate for any 2026 computation that depends on unregulated detail."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

Deterministic pre-classifier. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/description as it appears on the bank statement (Portuguese terms common in MZ). Most specific match wins. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules (Section 5). Terms are in Portuguese as they appear in Mozambican statements.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in MZN. IRPS computed as: **annual tax = annual income × bracket rate − parcela a abater**, then subtract personal/dependent collection deductions (Section 2/Section 5). Figures recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Resident employee, mid-range salary

**Input line:**
`25/03/2025 ; BCI TRANSFERÊNCIA ; EMPRESA XYZ LDA ; SALÁRIO MARÇO ; +50,000.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly gross salary MZN 50,000 → annualised MZN 600,000 (1st category). Falls in the 504,000–1,512,000 (25%) bracket.
Gross IRPS = 600,000 × 25% − 37,500 = 150,000 − 37,500 = **112,500**.
Less personal deduction (single/married taxpayer) MZN 1,800 → 112,500 − 1,800 = **110,700** annual IRPS.
INSS employee contribution = 3% × 50,000 = MZN 1,500/month.

**Classification:** 1st category. Annual gross IRPS MZN 112,500; after MZN 1,800 personal deduction, MZN 110,700. INSS employee MZN 1,500/month. (Personal deduction per PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/deductions.)

### Example 2 -- Resident employee, lower salary, two dependents

**Input line:**
`25/03/2025 ; MILLENNIUM BIM ; ORGANIZAÇÃO ABC ; ORDENADO ; +14,000.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross salary MZN 14,000/month → annual MZN 168,000 (1st category). At the top of the 42,000–168,000 (15%) bracket.
Gross IRPS = 168,000 × 15% − 2,100 = 25,200 − 2,100 = **23,100**.
Less personal deduction MZN 1,800; less 2-dependent deduction MZN 900 → 23,100 − 1,800 − 900 = **20,400** annual IRPS.
INSS employee = 3% × 14,000 = MZN 420/month.

**Classification:** 1st category. Annual IRPS MZN 20,400 after deductions. INSS employee MZN 420/month.

### Example 3 -- Non-resident consultant

**Input line:**
`10/04/2025 ; STANDARD BANK ; CLIENTE INTERNACIONAL ; HONORÁRIOS ; +200,000.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Payment to a non-resident for Mozambique-source services. Non-residents are taxed at a **flat 20% withholding** on MZ-source income (PwC). The progressive scale and personal deductions do NOT apply.
IRPS withheld = 200,000 × 20% = **40,000**.

**Classification:** Non-resident, flat 20%. IRPS MZN 40,000. No personal deductions.

### Example 4 -- Self-employed (2nd category), deductible expense

**Input line:**
`05/05/2025 ; BCI DÉBITO ; CONTABILISTA LDA ; HONORÁRIOS CONTABILIDADE ; -8,000.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Accountancy fee for a 2nd-category (business/professional) taxpayer with organized accounting (mandatory). Fully deductible against business income.

**Classification:** 2nd category deductible expense MZN 8,000.

### Example 5 -- INSS contribution remittance

**Input line:**
`08/04/2025 ; MILLENNIUM BIM ; INSS ; CONTRIBUIÇÃO MARÇO ; -3,500.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
For a MZN 50,000 monthly payroll: total INSS = 7% × 50,000 = MZN 3,500 (employee 3% = 1,500 + employer 4% = 2,000). Employer remits the full 7%. Per the INSS site the remittance window runs from the 20th of the current month to **the 10th of the following month**; PwC states the 15th — flag the discrepancy (Section 6).

**Classification:** INSS remittance MZN 3,500 (1,500 employee + 2,000 employer). Statutory, not a Box-2 business expense.

### Example 6 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BCI TRANSFERÊNCIA ; CONTA PRÓPRIA - POUPANÇA ; ; -20,000.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency Determines the Regime

- **Resident:** progressive 10%–32% scale on worldwide income; personal/dependent deductions apply.
- **Non-resident:** flat **20%** withholding on Mozambique-source income; no progressive scale, no personal deductions.
- From 2026 (Law 11/2025) residency no longer hinges on the >180-day test — see Section 11. Source: PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/taxes-on-personal-income

### 5.2 The Progressive Scale (resident)

Annual tax = **annual taxable income × bracket rate − parcela a abater** (Section 1 table). For monthly PAYE, annualise the salary, compute annual tax, then divide as withholding (employer remits by the 20th of the following month — Section 7). Source: PwC; AT IRPS process page — https://www.at.gov.mz/por/Processos-Fiscais/Imposto-sobre-o-Rendimento-de-Pessoas-Singulares-IRPS

### 5.3 Income Categories

| Category | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1st (Primeira) | Dependent/employment income | Monthly PAYE 0%–32% |
| 2nd (Segunda) | Business and professional/self-employed income | Organized accounting mandatory (Law 11/2025) |
| Other | Capital/investment, rental, commissions, independent work | Same 10%–32% scale |

Source: PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/taxes-on-personal-income

### 5.4 Personal / Dependent Collection Deductions

Flat annual amounts subtracted from the **computed tax** (collection deductions), per PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/deductions:

| Item | Annual deduction (MZN) |
|---|---|
| Each taxpayer (married or single) | 1,800 |
| 1 dependent | 600 |
| 2 dependents | 900 |
| 3 dependents | 1,200 |
| 4+ dependents | 1,800 |

Double-taxation relief credit is also available.

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** These are legacy values and may be revised by the pending Law 11/2025 regulations; not yet confirmed for 2026.

### 5.5 The Wholly-and-Exclusively Test (2nd category)

A business expense is deductible only if incurred for the business activity, supported by organized accounting. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned reasonably and documented.

### 5.6 Non-Deductible Items

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Entertainment / personal meals | Private |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| IRPS itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |

### 5.7 INSS (Social Security)

- Employee 3% + employer 4% = **7%** of monthly salary (Section 1). Base excludes the meal subsidy. **No ceiling identified.**
- Employer withholds the 3% employee share and remits the full 7%.
- **Worker registration:** within **30 days** of the start of the employment relationship.
- **Foreign employees** may apply for exemption from registration if contributing to a comparable scheme in their home country.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Apportionment (2nd category)

- Apportion electricity (EDM), water (FIPAG), internet by business-use proportion of the home.
- Must be a genuinely dedicated workspace.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until reviewer confirms arrangement.

### 6.2 Vehicle Business Use (2nd category)

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel and running costs is deductible; mileage log required.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until log provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business portion only (TMCEL / Vodacom / Movitel).
- **Conservative default:** 0% until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 INSS Payment Deadline Conflict

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The INSS official site states the remittance window runs from the 20th of the current month to **the 10th of the following month**; PwC states contributions are due **by the 15th of the following month**. The INSS site is the primary authority — default to the **10th** and flag for the reviewer to resolve against INSS legislation. Sources: INSS — https://www.inss.gov.mz/duvidas/ ; PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/other-taxes

### 6.5 ISPC vs Organized Accounting (2026 transition)

- ISPC (simplified) and exemption regimes are **abolished** for IRPS from 2026 (Law 11/2025). Affected taxpayers move to organized accounting.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the taxpayer's current regime status against AT before applying ISPC for any 2026 period.

### 6.6 Residency Reclassification (2026)

- Law 11/2025 may make foreign workers resident regardless of days present (Section 11).
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm residency under the new test for any 2026 computation.

### 6.7 Survival of Personal/Dependent Deductions (2026)

- Whether the MZN 1,800 personal deduction and dependent deductions survive Law 11/2025 is **not confirmed**.
- **Flag for reviewer** before relying on them for 2026.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Resident employee, MZN 600,000 annual.**
Input: Resident, annual employment income 600,000, single (no dependents).
Expected: 25% bracket → 600,000 × 25% − 37,500 = 150,000 − 37,500 = 112,500 gross IRPS; less personal deduction 1,800 = **110,700**.

**Test 2 -- Resident employee, MZN 168,000 annual, 2 dependents.**
Input: Resident, annual 168,000, 2 dependents.
Expected: 15% bracket → 168,000 × 15% − 2,100 = 25,200 − 2,100 = 23,100; less 1,800 personal − 900 (2 dependents) = **20,400**.

**Test 3 -- Resident, MZN 42,000 annual (bottom bracket).**
Input: Resident, annual 42,000, single.
Expected: 10% bracket → 42,000 × 10% − 0 = 4,200; less 1,800 = **2,400**.

**Test 4 -- Resident, MZN 2,000,000 annual (top bracket).**
Input: Resident, annual 2,000,000, single.
Expected: 32% bracket → 2,000,000 × 32% − 141,540 = 640,000 − 141,540 = 498,460; less 1,800 = **496,660**.

**Test 5 -- Non-resident, MZN 200,000 MZ-source.**
Input: Non-resident, 200,000.
Expected: 200,000 × 20% = **40,000**. No personal deductions.

**Test 6 -- INSS on MZN 50,000 monthly salary.**
Input: Monthly salary 50,000.
Expected: Employee 3% = 1,500; employer 4% = 2,000; total 7% = **3,500** remitted by employer. (1,500 + 2,000 = 3,500. ✓)

**Test 7 -- Meal subsidy excluded from INSS.**
Input: Salary 30,000 + meal subsidy 4,000.
Expected: INSS base = 30,000 (meal subsidy excluded). Employee 3% = 900; employer 4% = 1,200; total = 2,100.

## Section 11 -- Law No. 11/2025 (IRPS reform, in force 1 January 2026)

Key changes (verify final regulations, due within 180 days of the law):

1. **Residency redefined.** The >180-day physical-presence test is removed. Residency now turns on having one's main residence, main professional activity, or centre of economic interests in Mozambique; ship/aircraft crew of MZ entities; and MZ nationals on foreign assignment not fully taxed abroad. Effect: many foreign workers become resident regardless of days present.
2. **Simplified & exemption regimes abolished** for IRPS → affected taxpayers move to organized accounting (see ISPC, Section 5/Section 6).
3. **Filing waiver removed** for employees with PAYE-only income — from 2026 such employees must also file the Modelo 10.
4. **Digital services / e-money agent commissions:** **10% final (liberatory) withholding** on income from digital services and electronic-money agent commissions (including by non-residents); broadened taxable base for digital services performed/used in Mozambique.
5. **Capital gains:** new autonomous regime (Art. 54-A) taxed on the 10%–32% scale.
6. **Second-category taxpayers:** must keep organized accounting.

## Section 12 -- Open Items (figures NOT confirmed from authoritative fetched sources)

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** each of the following before publishing a number:

1. **ISPC threshold (MZN 2,500,000 turnover), 3% rate, and fixed amount (MZN 75,000)** — commonly published but not reconfirmed from a fetched AT page this session (AT TLS error). Verify on the AT ISPC page — https://www.at.gov.mz/por/Processos-Fiscais/Imposto-Simplificado-para-Pequenos-Contribuintes-ISPC . Note ISPC is abolished for IRPS from 2026.
2. **AT official IRPS rate/process pages** could not be fetched directly (certificate error); bracket data corroborated by PwC — confirm against AT when accessible.
3. **Exact IRPS penalty/interest rates** (juros de mora %, fixed fines under RGIT) — not obtained; verify before publishing numbers.
4. **INSS payment deadline conflict** — INSS site says by the 10th of the following month; PwC says by the 15th. Resolve against INSS legislation.
5. **Whether the MZN 1,800 personal deduction / dependent deductions survive Law 11/2025** — not confirmed for 2026.
6. **Municipal personal tax (Imposto Pessoal Autárquico)** — varies by municipality (Maputo ~MZN 510 for 2024 per PwC); confirm current-year value.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the progressive scale without confirming residency — non-residents pay a flat 20%
- NEVER apply personal/dependent deductions to a non-resident
- NEVER include the meal subsidy in the INSS contribution base
- NEVER state a total INSS rate other than 7% (3% employee + 4% employer)
- NEVER include IRPS itself, fines, drawings, or personal expenses as deductions
- NEVER apply the ISPC simplified regime to a 2026 period without confirming it survived Law 11/2025 (it is abolished)
- NEVER invent juros de mora / RGIT penalty rates — they are a RESEARCH GAP
- NEVER assume the >180-day residency test for 2026 — Law 11/2025 replaced it
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pending reviewer sign-off
- NEVER rely on the published parcela-a-abater continuity without the reviewer note in Section 1
