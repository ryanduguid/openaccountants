# Mozambique Social Security (INSS) & Payroll Tax Skill v0.1

> Mozambique **does** levy a personal income tax (IRPS), so this skill covers both the **INSS social contribution** (the primary subject) and the **IRPS payroll/PAYE reality** an employer must withhold. It is **not** a no-PIT jurisdiction.

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Mozambique (Republic of Mozambique) |
| Currency | Mozambican Metical (MZN / MT) -- this skill uses MZN only |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan -- 31 Dec) |
| Social security authority | Instituto Nacional de Segurança Social (INSS) |
| Tax authority | Autoridade Tributária de Moçambique (AT) |
| INSS employer rate | **4%** of monthly remuneration (PwC; mozambiqueexpert) |
| INSS employee rate | **3%** of monthly remuneration (PwC; mozambiqueexpert) |
| INSS total rate | **7%** (PwC; mozambiqueexpert) |
| INSS contribution floor | None found in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm] |
| INSS contribution ceiling | None found in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm] |
| INSS payment window | 20th of current month -- 10th of following month, via INSS e-platform (mozambiqueexpert) |
| IRPS resident regime | Progressive 10%--32% on annual taxable income (PwC) |
| IRPS PAYE remittance | By the 20th of the following month (PwC) |
| Non-resident IRPS | Flat 20% definitive withholding on Mozambique-source income (PwC) |
| Validated by | Pending -- requires sign-off by a Mozambican licensed tax professional |
| Validation date | Pending |

**INSS contribution overview:**

| Party | Rate | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 3% | Withheld by employer from gross remuneration (PwC) |
| Employer | 4% | Paid by employer on top of remuneration (PwC) |
| **Total remitted** | **7%** | Employer remits combined 3% + 4% to INSS (PwC; mozambiqueexpert) |

*Arithmetic check: 3% (employee) + 4% (employer) = 7% (total). ✓*

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether worker is employee vs self-employed | Assume employee; INSS 7% (4%+3%) applies |
| Unknown which pay items are in the contribution base | Include only basic wage + regular consistent items; EXCLUDE meal subsidy, one-off bonuses, reimbursements (PwC) |
| Unknown residency for IRPS | Ask -- do not assume; resident = worldwide progressive, non-resident = flat 20% (PwC) |
| Unknown whether foreign employee has home-country scheme | Apply INSS; exemption is by request only (PwC) |
| Unknown contribution floor/ceiling | Apply rate to full remuneration base; no statutory cap found [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Unknown sector for minimum-wage check | STOP -- minimum wage is sector-specific (DLA Piper) |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- monthly gross remuneration and a breakdown of pay components (so the contribution base can be isolated), plus worker status (employee vs self-employed).

**Recommended** -- residency status for IRPS, sector (for minimum-wage validation), and whether the worker is a foreign employee with a comparable home-country scheme.

**Ideal** -- INSS registration confirmation, prior payroll runs, and the AT NUIT (Número Único de Identificação Tributária) for the employer.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-MZ-INSS-1 -- Contribution base unclear.** *Trigger:* pay components not itemised. *Message:* "The INSS base includes basic wages, seniority/management bonuses, regular productivity/attendance premiums, night-work pay and consistent allowances/commissions, but EXCLUDES meal subsidies, irregular one-off bonuses and expense reimbursements. Cannot compute INSS without an itemised pay breakdown." (PwC; mozambiqueexpert)

**R-MZ-INSS-2 -- INSS arrears / penalties.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid INSS contributions. *Message:* "Late INSS contributions attract monthly late-payment interest plus administrative fines; the exact percentages are not stated in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Do not quantify arrears without an INSS statement. Escalate to a Mozambican licensed professional."

**R-MZ-INSS-3 -- Foreign-employee exemption.** *Trigger:* foreign employee claims INSS exemption. *Message:* "Foreign employees may request exemption only where they contribute to a comparable scheme in their home country. This is by application, not automatic. Escalate to confirm before excluding INSS." (PwC)

**R-MZ-IRPS-1 -- New IRPS residency / Law 11/2025 effects.** *Trigger:* client circumstances touch residency, digital-service income, electronic-money agent commissions, or capital gains. *Message:* "Law No. 11/2025 (effective 29 Dec 2025) redefined residency (removed the 180-day test), introduced a 10% final withholding on digital-service income and e-money agent commissions, and added an autonomous capital-gains regime (Art. 54-A). These require case-specific analysis. Escalate to a Mozambican licensed professional." (DLA Piper)

**R-MZ-IRPS-2 -- Exact penalty quantification.** *Trigger:* client asks for the exact MZN penalty for late filing/payment. *Message:* "Exact statutory IRPS penalty figures in MZN were not located from the authority; secondary estimates cite roughly USD 100--USD 33,000 plus interest [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Do not state a definitive figure. Escalate."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for Mozambican bank statement transactions. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference. INSS and IRPS payments always EXCLUDE from any VAT return or revenue/expense classification -- they are statutory payroll obligations, not business supplies. (Portuguese is the official language; references appear in Portuguese.)

### 3.1 INSS social-security debits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| INSS, I.N.S.S. | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Monthly 7% (4% employer + 3% employee) remittance |
| SEGURANCA SOCIAL, SEGURANÇA SOCIAL | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Portuguese-language reference |
| INST NACIONAL SEGURANCA SOCIAL | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Full authority name |
| CONTRIBUICAO INSS, CONTRIBUIÇÃO INSS | EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution | Explicit contribution reference |

### 3.2 IRPS / PAYE tax remittances (NOT INSS -- do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IRPS | EXCLUDE -- income tax (PAYE), not INSS | Withheld employee income tax remitted to AT |
| AUTORIDADE TRIBUTARIA, AT MOCAMBIQUE | EXCLUDE -- tax payment | AT remittance, not social security |
| EDECLARACAO, eDeclaração | EXCLUDE -- tax filing/payment | AT income-tax platform |
| IRPC | EXCLUDE -- corporate income tax | Company-level, not payroll INSS |
| IVA, VAT | EXCLUDE -- value added tax (16%) | Not INSS |

### 3.3 Salary and payroll (exclude from INSS classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARIO, SALÁRIO, ORDENADO (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Gross wage payment, not the INSS remittance |
| VENCIMENTO, PAGAMENTO SALARIAL (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Same |
| SALARIO, ORDENADO (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not an INSS payment |

### 3.4 Mozambican banks -- typical debit descriptions

| Bank | Typical description | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| BCI (Banco Comercial e de Investimentos) | "INSS" or "SEGURANCA SOCIAL" | EXCLUDE -- INSS |
| Millennium BIM | "INSS CONTRIB" or "SEGURANÇA SOCIAL" | EXCLUDE -- INSS |
| Standard Bank Moçambique | "INSS" or "INST NAC SEG SOCIAL" | EXCLUDE -- INSS |
| Absa Moçambique | "INSS" or "CONTRIBUICAO SOCIAL" | EXCLUDE -- INSS |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

All examples use a hypothetical Maputo employer. INSS figures are recomputed to the cent. Contribution base = pensionable remuneration after excluding meal subsidy, one-off bonuses and reimbursements (PwC).

### Example 1 -- Standard monthly INSS remittance (Millennium BIM)

**Input line:**
`10.02.2025 ; INSS CONTRIB ; DEBITO ; REF JANEIRO 2025 ; -2,100.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "INSS CONTRIB" (pattern 3.4, Millennium BIM). Single employee, contribution base MZN 30,000.00. Total INSS = 7% x 30,000.00 = **2,100.00** (employer 4% = 1,200.00; employee 3% = 900.00). Paid within the 20th-of-month to 10th-of-following-month window. EXCLUDE from VAT.

*Check: 30,000.00 x 0.07 = 2,100.00; 1,200.00 + 900.00 = 2,100.00. ✓*

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution.

### Example 2 -- INSS where meal subsidy must be excluded (BCI)

**Input line:**
`08.03.2025 ; SEGURANCA SOCIAL ; DEBITO ; FEV 2025 ; -1,400.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Employee gross pay MZN 25,000.00 but includes a MZN 5,000.00 meal subsidy, which is EXCLUDED from the base (PwC). Contribution base = 25,000.00 - 5,000.00 = 20,000.00. Total INSS = 7% x 20,000.00 = **1,400.00** (employer 800.00; employee 600.00).

*Check: 20,000.00 x 0.07 = 1,400.00; 800.00 + 600.00 = 1,400.00. ✓*

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- INSS contribution. Confirm meal subsidy was correctly excluded from base.

### Example 3 -- IRPS/PAYE remittance (NOT INSS)

**Input line:**
`18.02.2025 ; AUTORIDADE TRIBUTARIA ; DEBITO ; IRPS JANEIRO ; -3,200.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "AUTORIDADE TRIBUTARIA" + "IRPS" (pattern 3.2). This is withheld employee income tax remitted to the AT (due by the 20th of the following month, PwC), NOT a social-security contribution. Do not classify as INSS.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- income tax (IRPS/PAYE). NOT INSS.

### Example 4 -- Salary outgoing (payroll, not INSS)

**Input line:**
`25.02.2025 ; SALARIO JOAO MUCAVELE ; DEBITO ; VENCIMENTO FEV ; -28,100.00 ; MZN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "SALARIO" / "VENCIMENTO" (pattern 3.3). This is the net wage paid to the employee, not the INSS remittance. The employee's 3% INSS and IRPS were already withheld; the employer's 4% INSS is remitted separately (see Example 1/2).

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- payroll expense. NOT the INSS remittance.

### Example 5 -- Combined IRPS calculation for a mid-income employee

**Input data:** Resident employee, annual taxable income MZN 300,000.00. (IRPS bracket 168,000--504,000: 20%, parcela a abater MZN 10,500 -- PwC.)

**Reasoning:**
Annual IRPS = 300,000.00 x 20% - 10,500.00 = 60,000.00 - 10,500.00 = **49,500.00**.

*Check: 300,000.00 x 0.20 = 60,000.00; 60,000.00 - 10,500.00 = 49,500.00. ✓*

INSS on this salary (assuming the full MZN 300,000.00 / 12 = 25,000.00/month is pensionable base): employee 3% = 750.00/month = 9,000.00/year; employer 4% = 1,000.00/month = 12,000.00/year. The employee 3% is deductible from gross income for IRPS (PwC) -- reviewer to apply before final taxable base.

**Classification:** IRPS payable MZN 49,500.00 before the employee-INSS deduction adjustment. EXCLUDE all related remittances from VAT.

### Example 6 -- Non-resident flat withholding

**Input data:** Non-resident contractor, Mozambique-source fee MZN 100,000.00.

**Reasoning:**
Non-residents face a flat **20% definitive withholding** on Mozambique-source income (PwC). IRPS withheld = 100,000.00 x 20% = **20,000.00**. No progressive brackets, no annual return aggregation.

*Check: 100,000.00 x 0.20 = 20,000.00. ✓*

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Definitive 20% withholding, not progressive IRPS.

### Example 7 -- Minimum-wage validation (sector check)

**Input data:** Construction-sector employee, basic wage MZN 8,000.00/month.

**Reasoning:**
2025 construction minimum wage (Decree 92/2025) = **8,400.00/month** (DLA Piper). The proposed MZN 8,000.00 is **below** the sector minimum. STOP -- flag for reviewer; the wage must be raised to at least 8,400.00 before INSS is computed on it.

*Check: 8,000.00 < 8,400.00. ✓ (below minimum)*

**Classification:** Payroll non-compliant -- minimum wage breach. Escalate.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when pay data is clear and inputs are complete.

### Rule 1 -- INSS formula

```
INSS_employee = contribution_base x 3%
INSS_employer = contribution_base x 4%
INSS_total    = contribution_base x 7%
```

(Rates per PwC; mozambiqueexpert.) Employer withholds the 3% and remits the combined 7%.

### Rule 2 -- Contribution base

Include: basic wages, seniority bonuses, management bonuses, regular productivity/attendance premiums, night-work pay, consistent allowances/commissions. EXCLUDE: meal subsidies, irregular/one-time bonuses, expense reimbursements. (PwC; mozambiqueexpert)

### Rule 3 -- No statutory floor/ceiling found

No statutory minimum or maximum INSS contribution base was found in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Apply the 7% to the full qualifying base unless a reviewer confirms a cap.

### Rule 4 -- Employee 3% is IRPS-deductible

The employee's 3% INSS is deductible from gross income for IRPS purposes (PwC). Apply before computing progressive IRPS.

### Rule 5 -- IRPS resident progressive schedule

| Annual taxable income (MZN) | Rate | Parcela a abater (MZN) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 42,000 | 10% | 0 |
| 42,000 -- 168,000 | 15% | 2,100 |
| 168,000 -- 504,000 | 20% | 10,500 |
| 504,000 -- 1,512,000 | 25% | 37,500 |
| Over 1,512,000 | 32% | 141,540 |

(PwC; brackets confirmed unchanged by Law No. 11/2025, DLA Piper.) IRPS = income x marginal rate - parcela a abater. Monthly PAYE runs 0%--32%.

### Rule 6 -- Non-resident flat withholding

Non-residents: flat **20%** definitive withholding on Mozambique-source income (PwC). No aggregation, no annual return for that income.

### Rule 7 -- Foreign-employee INSS exemption is by request only

Foreign employees may request exemption only if they contribute to a comparable home-country scheme (PwC). Not automatic -- apply INSS unless a reviewer confirms exemption.

### Rule 8 -- INSS payment window

Contributions are payable between the **20th of the current month and the 10th of the following month**, via the electronic INSS platform (mozambiqueexpert). Treat the 10th of the following month as the deadline.

### Rule 9 -- IRPS / PAYE remittance and filing

Employer PAYE remittance by the **20th of the following month** (PwC). Annual return filed **January--April** following the tax year; from **1 Jan 2026**, resident individuals with only employment income must file an annual return (previously exempt if fully withheld) (PwC). Final tax payment: end of **May** (employment income) / end of **June** (other income) (PwC).

### Rule 10 -- Registration deadlines (INSS)

Employers register with INSS within **15 days** of business commencement; employees registered within **30 days** of contract start; status changes notified within **30 days** (mozambiqueexpert).

### Rule 11 -- Municipal/local tax

Local tax may apply, e.g. Maputo residents owe MZN 510/year (2024 rate), typically withheld by employer (PwC). Confirm the current-year figure with the municipality [RESEARCH GAP -- 2025/2026 rate to confirm].

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

Flag these for reviewer confirmation when data is ambiguous.

### T2-1 -- Pay-component classification ambiguity

**Trigger:** A pay item (e.g. a commission or allowance) may or may not be "regular/consistent" enough to enter the INSS base.
**Issue:** Only regular, consistent allowances/commissions are in-base; irregular ones are out (PwC). The boundary is judgemental.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer with the payment history.

### T2-2 -- Foreign employee with home-country scheme

**Trigger:** Foreign employee asserts a comparable home-country contribution.
**Issue:** Exemption is by application only and depends on the comparability of the foreign scheme (PwC).
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; do not exclude INSS without confirmation.

### T2-3 -- Law 11/2025 residency reclassification

**Trigger:** Worker's residency status is unclear post-29 Dec 2025.
**Issue:** Law 11/2025 removed the 180-day test and broadened residency to main residence, professional activity, centre of economic interests, Mozambican vessel/aircraft crew, and nationals on foreign assignment not fully taxed abroad (DLA Piper).
**Action:** Flag for reviewer to determine resident vs non-resident treatment.

### T2-4 -- Digital-service / e-money agent income

**Trigger:** Worker earns digital-service income or electronic-money agent commissions.
**Issue:** From Law 11/2025, these are subject to a final **10% withholding** (DLA Piper) -- different from standard PAYE.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer.

### T2-5 -- Capital gains (autonomous regime)

**Trigger:** Individual realises capital gains.
**Issue:** Law 11/2025 added an autonomous capital-gains regime (Art. 54-A) using the same 10%--32% schedule; such income is no longer aggregated (DLA Piper).
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; do not aggregate into employment IRPS.

### T2-6 -- INSS arrears / penalties

**Trigger:** Unpaid INSS from prior periods.
**Issue:** Monthly late-payment interest and administrative fines apply; exact rates not stated in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP].
**Action:** Do not quantify without an INSS statement. Escalate.

### T2-7 -- Minimum-wage breach

**Trigger:** Basic wage appears below the 2025 sector minimum (Section 10 table).
**Issue:** Minimum wages are sector-specific (Decrees 87/2025--94/2025, DLA Piper). A further revision took effect ~1 April 2026 [RESEARCH GAP -- 2026 figures not yet sourced].
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; payroll must comply before INSS computation.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How INSS and tax debits appear on Mozambican statements

**BCI (Banco Comercial e de Investimentos):**
- Description: "INSS" or "SEGURANCA SOCIAL"
- Timing: monthly, in the 20th-to-10th window (deadline 10th of following month)
- Amount: 7% of the monthly contribution base

**Millennium BIM:**
- Description: "INSS CONTRIB" or "SEGURANÇA SOCIAL"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Standard Bank Moçambique / Absa Moçambique:**
- Description: "INSS" / "INST NAC SEG SOCIAL" / "CONTRIBUICAO SOCIAL"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Key identification tips:**
1. INSS debits are outgoing (DEBITO), monthly, and equal 7% of the contribution base.
2. Do NOT confuse with AT/IRPS debits (income tax, due 20th of following month) or IRPC (corporate) or IVA (16% VAT).
3. Salary debits ("SALARIO", "VENCIMENTO", "ORDENADO") are net wages, not the INSS remittance.
4. References are typically in Portuguese.
5. The INSS figure should reconcile to 0.07 x base; the employee share alone is 0.03 x base.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for INSS debits** -- identify outgoing payments matching Section 3.1/3.4 patterns.
2. **Reverse-engineer the base** -- INSS / 0.07 = contribution base (e.g. 2,100.00 / 0.07 = 30,000.00).
3. **Separate tax from social security** -- AT/IRPS debits are income tax, not INSS; IRPC/IVA are company-level.
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "INSS and IRPS figures derived from bank statement amounts only. Contribution base composition, residency, and sector minimum wage have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing."

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Contribution base MZN 30,000.00. -> Employee 900.00, Employer 1,200.00, Total 2,100.00. *(30,000 x 0.03 = 900; x 0.04 = 1,200; x 0.07 = 2,100 ✓)*

**Test 2:** Gross 25,000.00 incl. 5,000.00 meal subsidy. -> Base 20,000.00; Total INSS 1,400.00. *(20,000 x 0.07 = 1,400 ✓)*

**Test 3:** Resident annual taxable income 300,000.00. -> IRPS 49,500.00. *(300,000 x 0.20 - 10,500 = 49,500 ✓)*

**Test 4:** Resident annual taxable income 504,000.00. -> IRPS 88,500.00. *(504,000 x 0.25 - 37,500 = 88,500 ✓)*

**Test 5:** Resident annual taxable income 2,000,000.00. -> IRPS 498,460.00. *(2,000,000 x 0.32 - 141,540 = 498,460 ✓)*

**Test 6:** Non-resident Mozambique-source fee 100,000.00. -> 20% flat = 20,000.00. *(100,000 x 0.20 = 20,000 ✓)*

**Test 7:** Construction basic wage 8,000.00. -> Below 2025 minimum 8,400.00 (Decree 92/2025). STOP -- minimum-wage breach.

**Test 8:** Foreign employee claims exemption, no confirmed home scheme. -> Apply INSS 7%; exemption is by request only (PwC).

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute INSS without an itemised pay breakdown -- the base excludes meal subsidies, one-off bonuses and reimbursements.
- NEVER assume an INSS floor or ceiling exists -- none was found in authoritative sources [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER treat an AT/IRPS debit as INSS, or vice versa -- they are separate obligations with different deadlines.
- NEVER apply progressive IRPS brackets to a non-resident -- they face a flat 20% definitive withholding.
- NEVER exclude INSS for a foreign employee without confirmed home-country-scheme exemption.
- NEVER compute payroll on a wage below the sector minimum -- validate against the 2025 decree table first.
- NEVER quantify INSS or IRPS penalties from this skill -- exact figures are unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP]; escalate.
- NEVER ignore Law 11/2025 residency, digital-income, e-money or capital-gains changes -- flag to reviewer.
- NEVER present figures as definitive -- label as estimated and direct the client to their INSS statement and the AT.
