## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (IRPS — Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares)

Mozambique **does** levy personal income tax on employees. The employer is the
**withholding agent**: it deducts IRPS monthly from payroll and remits it monthly to the
AT. IRPS is formally **assessed annually** on a progressive 10%–32% scale, but the
operative payroll mechanism is the **monthly PAYE table** (RSM 2025 p.14), which
approximates the annual scale and is keyed to **monthly remuneration AND the number of
dependents (0–4+)**.

The IRPS employment-income brackets (10%–32%) and thresholds were **re-confirmed unchanged
by Lei n.º 11/2025** (effective 29 December 2025) (DLA Piper Africa).

### IRPS Annual Progressive Table — residents (PwC, 2024 tax year; unchanged by Lei 11/2025)

`tax = annual taxable income × rate − deduction` (subtract method):

| Annual taxable income (MZN) | Marginal rate | Deduction (MZN) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 42,000 | **10%** | — |
| 42,000 – 168,000 | **15%** | 2,100 |
| 168,000 – 504,000 | **20%** | 10,500 |
| 504,000 – 1,512,000 | **25%** | 37,500 |
| Over 1,512,000 | **32%** | 141,540 |

Source: PwC — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/mozambique/individual/taxes-on-personal-income (last reviewed 04 Mar 2026).

*Continuity note:* the first three bands tie out exactly under the subtract method
(at 42,000 → 10%×42,000 = 15%×42,000 − 2,100 = **4,200**; at 168,000 →
15%×168,000 − 2,100 = 20%×168,000 − 10,500 = **23,100**). The 25% and 32% bands as
published do **not** tie perfectly at their edges (at 504,000 the 20% formula gives
90,300 but the 25% formula gives 90,300 only if the deduction were 35,700, not 37,500;
the published 37,500 yields 88,500). This is a feature of the PwC-published presentation.
**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact 25%/32% deduction constants against the
Código do IRPS / AT tables before relying on annual-table results in those bands.]**

### Monthly PAYE table — THE operative payroll mechanism (RSM 2025 p.14)

Employers withhold monthly using a table keyed to **monthly remuneration and the number
of dependents (0–4+)**. Each income/dependent cell carries a marginal rate and a fixed
deduction. Confirmed thresholds (monthly MZN, 0 dependents):

| Monthly remuneration (MZN) | Marginal rate |
|---|---|
| Up to **20,249.99** | **0%** (effective monthly exemption floor) |
| 20,250 – 60,749.99 (band incl. 10%/15%/20% sub-steps) | **10% → 20%** |
| 60,750 – 144,749.99 | **25%** |
| Over **144,750** | **32%** |

At 144,750+ with 0 dependents the published deduction is **28,375** (RSM 2025 p.14). The
number of dependents shifts both the deduction and the entry point.

### Non-residents

**Flat 20%** final withholding on Mozambique-source employment income. This also applies
to a resident not present in the country (see residency note) and to income paid to a
service provider. Source: PwC; RSM 2025 p.14.

### Other IRPS rates relevant to payroll-adjacent income (RSM 2025 p.15)

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Self-employment / service provision (resident) | **20%** | RSM 2025 p.15 |
| Professional artists and athletes | **10%** | RSM 2025 p.15 |
| Electronic-money agents' commissions; non-resident digital services | **10% final WHT** (new, Lei 11/2025) | DLA Piper Africa |

### Lei n.º 11/2025 changes (effective 29 December 2025)

- Eliminates the 180-day physical-presence test; residency now based on **primary
  residence / centre of economic interests / professional activity**.
- Adds **10% final WHT** on digital services and e-money agent commissions.
- Employment-income brackets (10%–32%) and thresholds **unchanged**.

### Deduction before taxable income

- The **employee's 3% INSS contribution is deductible** from gross income for IRPS
  purposes (PwC). The skill therefore computes IRPS on `gross − employee INSS`.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security (INSS) — Employee + Employer

INSS is administered by the Instituto Nacional de Segurança Social. Rates confirmed by
**INSS Note n.º 246/INSS/GAB-DG/432/2024** (cited in RSM 2025 p.16):

| Party | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Employee** | **3%** | INSS Note 246/2024; RSM 2025 p.16 |
| **Employer** | **4%** | INSS Note 246/2024; RSM 2025 p.16 |
| **Total** | **7%** | INSS Note 246/2024; RSM 2025 p.16 |

*Column check:* employee 3% + employer 4% = **7%** total. Tie out.

- **Base:** monthly **regular** remuneration (salary, wages, regular bonuses).
- **Excluded from base:** meal subsidies; profit-sharing, dividends, holiday pay and
  similar **irregular** payments are NOT in the contribution base (RSM 2025 p.16).
- **No salary floor or ceiling** is specified in the authoritative sources — contributions
  are on full regular remuneration (RSM 2025 pp.16–17).
- **Employee's 3% is IRPS-deductible** (PwC).
- **Registration:** employers must register ALL employees (Mozambican and expat). Expats
  are exempt only if they prove coverage in another country's scheme (request to INSS
  required) (RSM 2025 pp.16–17).
- **Expat refund:** foreign employees can reclaim their 3% if they leave permanently before
  retirement entitlement; the right **expires 1 year** after the last contribution
  (RSM 2025 pp.16–17).

## Section 4 -- Minimum Wage (sectoral)

Mozambique sets minimum wages **by sector** — there is **no single national figure**. The
2025 values were approved by the Council of Ministers on 2 Sept 2025, increases of
**2.9%–9%**, effective **retroactively from 1 July 2025**. Selected monthly figures (MZN):

| Sector | Min wage (MZN/month) | Increase | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agriculture, livestock, hunting, forestry | **6,688** | +5.5% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |
| Fishing (maritime/industrial/semi-industrial) | **6,726.88** | +2.9% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |
| Hotels / tourism | **9,700** | +9% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |
| Non-financial services (general) | **10,310** | +7.8% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |
| Microfinance / micro-insurance | **16,764** | +6.5% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |
| Financial services — banks / insurance | **19,043.61** | +6.5% | Club of Mozambique; DLA Piper |

Sources: https://clubofmozambique.com/news/mozambique-minimum-wages-increase-2-9-to-9-depending-on-sector-with-retroactive-effect-from-1-july/
and https://www.dlapiperafrica.com/pt/mozambique/insights/2025/Approval-of-New-Minimum-Wages-2025

> The lowest sector minimum (≈**6,688** MZN/month) sits **below** the monthly IRPS 0% PAYE
> floor (≈**20,250** MZN/month), so most minimum-wage earners owe **no IRPS** but **do pay
> the 3% INSS**.

---

## Section 5 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative** assumption (the one that
does NOT understate withholding/contributions) and FLAG it for the reviewer.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Residency status | Treat as **resident** (progressive PAYE table) ONLY if presence/economic-interest evidence supports it; otherwise FLAG. If clearly non-resident, apply flat **20%**. | Lei 11/2025 changed the residency test |
| Number of dependents | Use **0 dependents** if unproven | Fewer dependents → higher withholding → conservative |
| Whether monthly pay ≤ 20,249.99 floor | Apply **0% PAYE** only when clearly at/below the floor | Floor is the published exemption |
| INSS base composition | Include only **regular** remuneration; exclude meal subsidy, profit-share, dividends, holiday pay | RSM 2025 p.16 |
| INSS ceiling | **None** — contribute on full regular remuneration | No ceiling in sources |
| Employee INSS deductibility for IRPS | Always deduct employee **3%** before IRPS base | PwC |
| Expat INSS | Register and contribute **3%/4%** unless foreign-scheme coverage proven | RSM 2025 pp.16–17 |
| Tax year | Default to **2025** table unless date triggers Lei 11/2025 changes (≥ 29 Dec 2025) | Skill tax_year is 2025 |
| Currency | Metical (MZN) | Local currency |

## Section 6 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing payroll

1. Gross monthly salary in Meticais (and which components are **regular** vs irregular).
2. Residency status (resident vs non-resident) and supporting evidence.
3. Number of dependents (0–4+) for the monthly PAYE cell.
4. Pay frequency (monthly assumed).
5. Tax/fiscal year (2024/2025 table vs Lei 11/2025 changes from 29 Dec 2025).
6. Whether the employee is an expat with proven foreign social-security coverage.
7. Confirmation of any non-regular pay components (meal subsidy, profit-share, holiday pay).

### Refusal catalogue — DO NOT compute, refuse and request input

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No gross salary provided | REFUSE — request salary in Meticais |
| Salary stated in USD/EUR with no MZN conversion and no rate | REFUSE — request MZN figure |
| Request to omit IRPS withholding or INSS to "save money" | REFUSE — both are statutory; escalate to accountant |
| Request to apply resident progressive rates to a clear non-resident (or vice versa) | REFUSE — confirm residency under Lei 11/2025 first |
| Request to include meal subsidy / profit-share in the INSS base | REFUSE — excluded by RSM 2025 p.16; flag |
| Self-employment / service-provider / digital-services income mixed in | REFUSE payroll path — route to the relevant IRPS/WHT treatment (20% / 10%) |
| Definitive "this is your exact tax" assertion requested | REFUSE — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |
| Precise late-filing penalty amount requested | REFUSE the precise figure — penalty schedule is an unconfirmed research gap |

## Section 7 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Classify bank-statement lines deterministically. Match case-insensitively; longest /
most-specific pattern wins.

### Salary credits (money arriving in an employee account)

| Pattern (case-insensitive) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SALARIO`, `ORDENADO`, `VENCIMENTO`, `PAGAMENTO SALARIO` | Net salary payment |
| `TRANSF.* [empresa]`, `CREDITO SALARIO` | Net salary payment |
| `SUBSIDIO REFEICAO`, `SUBS. ALIMENTACAO` | Meal subsidy (excluded from INSS base) |
| `13.* MES`, `SUBSIDIO NATAL` | Year-end / Christmas subsidy (irregular — outside INSS base) |
| `REEMBOLSO INSS`, `DEVOLUCAO INSS` | INSS refund/adjustment — not income |

### Employer debits (money leaving the employer account)

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `AT`, `IRPS`, `RETENCAO IRPS`, `MODELO 19`, `M/19` | IRPS PAYE remitted to the AT (liability settlement) |
| `INSS`, `SEGURANCA SOCIAL`, `CONTRIBUICAO INSS` | INSS contribution (employer 4% + employee 3%) |
| `PAGAMENTO SALARIOS`, `FOLHA SALARIAL`, `PROCESSAMENTO` | Net wages disbursed to employees |
| `IRPC`, `IMPOSTO RENDIMENTO PESSOAS COLECTIVAS` | Corporate income tax — route to a corporate skill, not payroll |

## Section 8 -- Worked Examples

> Resident examples compute IRPS via the **annual progressive table** (PwC, sourced) on
> `gross − employee 3% INSS`, then divide by 12 for a monthly estimate. This is an
> **estimation method**: the operative monthly PAYE per-cell matrix (with dependents) is a
> research gap, and below the **20,250/month** floor the monthly PAYE table withholds **0%**
> even where the annualised method would show tax. Where the two diverge, the example shows
> both and FLAGS it. INSS employee = 3%, employer = 4%, no ceiling. Amounts to the cent.

### Example 1 — Minimum-wage earner (agriculture), below the PAYE floor

**Inputs:** Salary **6,688 MZN/month** (agriculture sector minimum), resident, 0 dependents.

- Monthly pay 6,688 < **20,250** PAYE floor → **IRPS PAYE = 0.00** (operative table).
- INSS employee 3% × 6,688 = **200.64**.
- **Net pay** = 6,688.00 − 0.00 − 200.64 = **6,487.36 MZN**.
- Employer INSS 4% × 6,688 = **267.52**; total employer cost = 6,688.00 + 267.52 = **6,955.52**.

*Bank line example:* `PAGAMENTO SALARIO — JUNHO` credit **6,487.36 MZN**.

### Example 2 — Financial-sector minimum-wage earner, just below the PAYE floor

**Inputs:** Salary **19,043.61 MZN/month** (banks/insurance minimum), resident, 0 dependents.

- Monthly pay 19,043.61 < **20,250** floor → **IRPS PAYE = 0.00** (operative monthly table).
- INSS employee 3% × 19,043.61 = **571.31**.
- **Net pay** = 19,043.61 − 0.00 − 571.31 = **18,472.30 MZN**.

> *Annual-table cross-check (illustrative only):* taxable = (19,043.61 × 12) − (571.31 × 12)
> = 228,523.32 − 6,855.72 = 221,667.60; annual IRPS = 0.20 × 221,667.60 − 10,500 = 33,833.52;
> ÷12 ≈ 2,819.46/month. The operative monthly PAYE table withholds **0** at this level
> because the pay is below the 20,250 floor. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm how the
> 0% floor reconciles with annual assessment for sub-floor earners.]**

### Example 3 — Mid earner, into the 20% annual band

**Inputs:** Salary **30,000 MZN/month**, resident, 0 dependents.

- INSS employee 3% × 30,000 = **900.00/month** → annual **10,800.00**.
- Annual taxable = (30,000 × 12) − 10,800 = 360,000 − 10,800 = **349,200.00** (20% band:
  168,000–504,000).
- Annual IRPS = 0.20 × 349,200 − 10,500 = 69,840.00 − 10,500 = **59,340.00/year**.
- Monthly IRPS estimate ≈ 59,340.00 ÷ 12 = **4,945.00**.
- **Employee deductions** = 4,945.00 + 900.00 = **5,845.00**.
- **Net pay** = 30,000.00 − 5,845.00 = **24,155.00 MZN**.

### Example 4 — Higher earner, 20% band

**Inputs:** Salary **60,000 MZN/month**, resident, 0 dependents.

- INSS employee 3% × 60,000 = **1,800.00/month** → annual **21,600.00**.
- Annual taxable = 720,000 − 21,600 = **698,400.00** (25% band: 504,000–1,512,000).
- Annual IRPS = 0.25 × 698,400 − 37,500 = 174,600.00 − 37,500 = **137,100.00/year**.
- Monthly IRPS estimate ≈ 137,100.00 ÷ 12 = **11,425.00**.
- **Employee deductions** = 11,425.00 + 1,800.00 = **13,225.00**.
- **Net pay** = 60,000.00 − 13,225.00 = **46,775.00 MZN**.

### Example 5 — Top-band earner (32% annual)

**Inputs:** Salary **150,000 MZN/month**, resident, 0 dependents.

- INSS employee 3% × 150,000 = **4,500.00/month** → annual **54,000.00**.
- Annual taxable = 1,800,000 − 54,000 = **1,746,000.00** (over 1,512,000 → 32% band).
- Annual IRPS = 0.32 × 1,746,000 − 141,540 = 558,720.00 − 141,540 = **417,180.00/year**.
- Monthly IRPS estimate ≈ 417,180.00 ÷ 12 = **34,765.00**.
- **Employee deductions** = 34,765.00 + 4,500.00 = **39,265.00**.
- **Net pay** = 150,000.00 − 39,265.00 = **110,735.00 MZN**.

### Example 6 — Non-resident, flat 20%

**Inputs:** MZ-source employment income **60,000 MZN/month**, **non-resident**.

- Non-resident final WHT = 20% × 60,000 = **12,000.00** (no progressive table; flat).
- **Net pay** = 60,000.00 − 12,000.00 = **48,000.00 MZN**.
- INSS still applies if the engagement is INSS-covered employment (3% employee / 4% employer),
  unless foreign-scheme coverage is proven. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm INSS
  applicability to a non-resident in this fact pattern.]**

### Example 7 — Employer total cost of a mid earner (30,000 MZN/month)

Building on Example 3:

| Employer cost item | Computation | Amount (MZN) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross salary | — | 30,000.00 |
| INSS employer 4% | 4% × 30,000.00 | 1,200.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | sum | **31,200.00** |

*Check:* 30,000.00 + 1,200.00 = **31,200.00**. Tie out. (Employer-on-top burden =
1,200.00 = 4.00% of gross — INSS has no ceiling, so this 4% holds at every salary level.)

---

## Section 9 -- Tier 1 Rules (hard, non-negotiable)

1. IRPS is **employer-withheld monthly** and remitted to the AT via **Form 19 (M/19)** by
   the **20th** of the following month (RSM 2025 pp.3–4).
2. INSS is **employee 3% + employer 4% = 7%**, on **regular** remuneration, **no ceiling**,
   filed and paid by the **10th** of the following month (INSS Note 246/2024; RSM 2025).
3. The **employee's 3% INSS is deductible** from gross before the IRPS base (PwC).
4. Monthly remuneration **at or below ≈20,250 MZN** withholds **0% IRPS** under the
   operative monthly PAYE table (RSM 2025 p.14).
5. **Non-residents** pay a **flat 20%** final withholding on MZ-source employment income
   (PwC; RSM 2025 p.14).
6. Meal subsidies and irregular payments (profit-share, dividends, holiday pay) are
   **excluded** from the INSS base (RSM 2025 p.16).
7. The annual **Nominal List (Lista Nominal)** is due **30 April** (RSM 2025 pp.3–4).
8. Lei 11/2025 (eff. 29 Dec 2025) left the 10%–32% employment brackets **unchanged** but
   redefined **residency** (no 180-day test) — confirm residency before choosing the table.
9. Every output is an **estimate** pending licensed-accountant sign-off.

## Section 13 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data:

1. **No prior payroll register available** → request the last 3 months of folhas salariais
   and INSS/AT (M/19) receipts to back-solve the rates and PAYE cells actually applied.
2. **Unknown dependents** → default **0 dependents**, FLAG; confirm before first remittance.
3. **Unknown residency** → gather presence / economic-interest evidence under Lei 11/2025;
   do not assume the resident table without it.
4. **Unknown sector / min-wage band** → use the relevant 2025 sectoral figure only as a
   sanity check, never as the contractual wage; obtain the employee's contract.
5. **Expat employee** → confirm whether foreign-scheme coverage is proven before deciding
   INSS applicability; request the INSS exemption confirmation if claimed.
6. **Full monthly PAYE matrix needed** → obtain the official AT table / RSM p.14 matrix
   before computing 10%–20% band withholding precisely.

## Section 15 -- Penalties (late filing / late payment)

Governed by the **Código Geral Tributário** and the Fiscal Offences regime (Regime Geral
das Infracções Tributárias / RGIT).

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late-payment interest | Charged at the **12-month MAIBOR interbank rate + 2% surcharge** | South African Tax Guide / KPMG fiscal-guide summary (secondary) |
| Late payment / non-payment / inadequate records | Additional fines (multas) under the Código Geral Tributário and the Fiscal Offences regime | Código Geral Tributário; RGIT |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The exact statutory **fine percentages and
> monetary amounts** (e.g. specific multas for a late M/19 or a late INSS return) could NOT
> be confirmed from a clean authoritative source — the primary AT text and the Orbitax page
> were not retrievable. Read the precise penalty schedule directly from the **Código Geral
> Tributário / RGIT** before relying on any figure beyond the **MAIBOR + 2%** interest.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER skip IRPS withholding for taxable salaried employees — the employer is the legal
  withholding agent and must file Form 19 (M/19).
- NEVER apply IRPS above the 0% PAYE floor (≈20,250/mo) without the correct dependent cell —
  and never below it where the operative monthly table withholds 0%.
- NEVER include meal subsidies or irregular payments (profit-share, dividends, holiday pay)
  in the INSS contribution base.
- NEVER apply an INSS ceiling — the authoritative sources specify none.
- NEVER forget that the employee's 3% INSS is deductible before the IRPS base.
- NEVER apply the resident progressive table to a non-resident — non-residents pay a flat
  20% final withholding.
- NEVER assume residency under the old 180-day test — Lei 11/2025 removed it.
- NEVER state an exact late-filing penalty amount — only the MAIBOR + 2% interest is
  sourced; the fine schedule is an unconfirmed research gap.
- NEVER miss the INSS (10th) or IRPS M/19 (20th) monthly deadline, or the 30 April Nominal
  List.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to
  a licensed Mozambican accountant.
