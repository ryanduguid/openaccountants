# Ethiopia Social Security & Payroll Tax Skill v0.1

> **Reform note.** Ethiopia overhauled personal income taxation via the **Income Tax (Amendment) Proclamation No. 1395/2025** (approved by Parliament 17 July 2025; effective **7 July 2025**, with local withholding provisions effective 1 August 2025). Every PAYE figure in this skill reflects the post-reform regime.

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |

| Country | Ethiopia (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) |
| Primary Legislation (PAYE) | Income Tax (Amendment) Proclamation No. 1395/2025 (amends Proclamation No. 979/2016) |

| Employer pension rate | 11% of basic salary [PwC, Other taxes] |
| Total pension rate | 18% of basic salary [PwC, Other taxes] |
| Contribution base | Basic salary (normal-hours basic pay), NOT total gross with allowances [PwC, Other taxes] |
| PAYE exemption threshold | First 2,000 ETB/month exempt [PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025] |

| Validation date | Pending |

**Who is covered by the pension scheme:**

| Category | Pension status | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Ethiopian citizens (private-org employees) | Mandatory | PwC, Other taxes |
| Foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin | Optional | PwC, Other taxes |
| Other (non-Ethiopian-origin) foreign nationals | Excluded — not available | PwC, Other taxes |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown citizenship / origin | STOP — pension eligibility depends on citizenship; do not deduct 7% without confirming the employee is an Ethiopian citizen or Ethiopian-origin foreign national who has opted in |
| Unknown contribution base | Use **basic salary**, not total gross; if only gross is known, flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether allowances are part of "basic salary" | Treat allowances as OUTSIDE the pension base; flag for reviewer |
| Unknown public vs private sector | Assume private sector (POESSA); flag if employer is a government body |
| Unknown whether a debit is PAYE or pension | Classify by counterparty (MoR = PAYE; POESSA = pension); flag if reference is bare |
| Pension salary ceiling/floor | None found in authoritative sources — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**; compute on full basic salary and flag |

---

## Section 2 -- Rate and bracket tables

### 2.1 Pension contributions (the core of this skill)

| Party | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 7% | Basic salary | PwC, Other taxes |
| Employer | 11% | Basic salary | PwC, Other taxes |
| **Total** | **18%** | Basic salary | PwC, Other taxes |

*Arithmetic check: 7% + 11% = 18%.*

- **Base = basic salary** (gross basic pay for normal working hours), explicitly NOT total gross including allowances [PwC, Other taxes].
- **No statutory floor or ceiling** on contributable salary was found in authoritative sources (POESSA/PwC). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether any salary cap applies; do not assert one either way.
- **Vesting:** an employee must contribute at least **10 years** to qualify for a retirement pension [PwC, Other taxes; 2merkato labour-law background].
- **Remittance:** the employer deducts the employee's 7% and remits both contributions (18% total) **within 30 days** of the deduction / the last day of the salary month [PwC, Other taxes].
- **Enforcement:** if an employer fails to pay contributions for **three months**, the Social Security Agency may deduct arrears directly from the company's bank account [PwC, Other taxes].

### 2.2 Employment income tax (PAYE) — monthly brackets (effective 7 July 2025)

| Monthly salary (ETB) | Marginal rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,000 | 0% (exempt) | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |
| 2,001 – 4,000 | 15% | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |
| 4,001 – 7,000 | 20% | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | 25% | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |
| 10,001 – 14,000 | 30% | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |
| Over 14,000 | 35% | PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025 |

- Minimum taxable income raised to **2,000 ETB/month** (was 600). Income at or below 2,000 ETB is fully exempt [PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025].
- Brackets reduced from seven to six; lowest positive rate raised from 10% to 15%; top rate 35% now applies above 14,000 ETB/month (previously above 10,900 ETB) [PwC; PaySpace; MyWorkPay].

### 2.3 PAYE quick-calculation (deduction) method — **DERIVED**

Ethiopian PAYE is conventionally computed as `tax = (monthly salary × rate) − deduction`. The deduction constants below are the **arithmetic equivalent** of the progressive brackets in 2.2. They were computed from the official rate/threshold structure and were **not** found stated verbatim on an authoritative page — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the official Ministry of Revenue schedule]**.

| Monthly salary (ETB) | Rate | Deduction (derived) | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,000 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| 2,001 – 4,000 | 15% | 300 | 300 |
| 4,001 – 7,000 | 20% | 500 | 900 |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | 25% | 850 | 1,650 |
| 10,001 – 14,000 | 30% | 1,350 | 2,850 |
| Over 14,000 | 35% | 2,050 | (open-ended) |

*Arithmetic self-check of the cumulative tax column (recomputed end-to-end):*
- At 4,000: 2,000 × 15% = 300. Quick-calc: 4,000 × 15% − 300 = 300. ✓
- At 7,000: 300 + 3,000 × 20% = 900. Quick-calc: 7,000 × 20% − 500 = 900. ✓
- At 10,000: 900 + 3,000 × 25% = 1,650. Quick-calc: 10,000 × 25% − 850 = 1,650. ✓
- At 14,000: 1,650 + 4,000 × 30% = 2,850. Quick-calc: 14,000 × 30% − 1,350 = 2,850. ✓
- Continuity into top band at 14,000: 14,000 × 35% − 2,050 = 2,850. ✓

## Section 3 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — employee citizenship/origin status and monthly basic salary. Without citizenship/origin status, STOP: pension eligibility (and therefore the 7% deduction) cannot be determined.

**Recommended** — full gross pay split into basic salary vs allowances, public vs private sector, and the salary month (Ethiopian-calendar offset matters for deadlines).

**Ideal** — POESSA registration confirmation, MoR PAYE registration confirmation, bank statements showing monthly pension and PAYE remittances, and the employer payroll register.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-ET-1 -- Citizenship/origin unknown.** *Trigger:* employee citizenship or Ethiopian-origin status not provided. *Message:* "Pension eligibility depends on citizenship. The 7%/11% pension scheme is mandatory only for Ethiopian citizens, optional for foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin, and unavailable to other foreign nationals. Cannot apply the pension deduction without this information."

**R-ET-2 -- Pension salary cap.** *Trigger:* client asks whether a ceiling caps the contributable salary. *Message:* "No statutory pension floor or ceiling was found in authoritative sources. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether a cap applies before relying on an uncapped 18% computation. Escalate to a licensed Ethiopian practitioner."

**R-ET-3 -- Pension arrears / direct bank recovery.** *Trigger:* employer has unpaid contributions, especially three months or more. *Message:* "After three months of non-payment the Social Security Agency may deduct arrears directly from the company's bank account. Quantifying arrears (principal plus any charges) requires the POESSA statement. Escalate to a licensed practitioner."

**R-ET-4 -- PAYE penalties and interest.** *Trigger:* client asks the exact late-filing/late-payment penalty or interest figures. *Message:* "Exact income-tax penalty and interest rates could not be confirmed from a fully authoritative source. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against Federal Tax Administration Proclamation No. 983/2016 (as amended) and the Ministry of Revenue. Do not quote a penalty figure as definitive."

**R-ET-5 -- Public-sector employees.** *Trigger:* employer is a government body / employee is a public servant. *Message:* "Public-sector pensions are administered by the Public Servants' Social Security Agency, not POESSA, and may use different rules. This skill covers the private-sector POESSA scheme. Escalate to a reviewer."

## Section 4 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Ethiopian payroll. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Pension and PAYE remittances always EXCLUDE from any VAT return — they are statutory payroll obligations, not taxable supplies. Amharic terms may appear; common ones are noted.

### 4.1 Pension (POESSA) remittances

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| POESSA | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | Private Organisation Employees Social Security Agency |
| PRIVATE ORGAN PENSION, PENSION CONTRIB | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | Employer + employee 18% |
| SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY, SSA | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | POESSA or public-sector agency |
| PENSION 18%, PENSION 7%, PENSION 11% | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | Explicit split reference |
| ጡረታ (TIRETA = pension) | EXCLUDE — pension remittance | Amharic-language reference |

### 4.2 PAYE / employment income tax remittances

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MINISTRY OF REVENUE, MOR | EXCLUDE — PAYE remittance | Withheld employment income tax |
| PAYE, EMPLOYMENT INCOME TAX | EXCLUDE — PAYE remittance | Monthly withholding |
| ERCA, REVENUE AUTHORITY | EXCLUDE — PAYE remittance | Legacy / regional revenue references |
| የገቢ ግብር (YEGEBI GIBIR = income tax) | EXCLUDE — PAYE remittance | Amharic-language reference |

### 4.3 Salary and payroll (exclude from pension/PAYE classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARY, NET PAY, ደመወዝ (DEMEWEZ = salary) (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | The net wage paid to staff, not a contribution |
| SALARY, NET PAY (incoming) | EXCLUDE — employment income received | Not a contribution |

### 4.4 Other taxes (NOT pension/PAYE — do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VAT, ተ.እ.ታ (VAT) | EXCLUDE from this skill | Output/input VAT, separate regime |
| WITHHOLDING 2%, WHT | EXCLUDE from this skill | Supplier withholding, not PAYE |
| PROFIT TAX, BUSINESS INCOME TAX | EXCLUDE from this skill | Corporate/business income tax |

## Section 5 -- Worked examples

Five bank-statement / payroll classifications for a hypothetical private-sector employer in Addis Ababa with Ethiopian-citizen employees. All figures recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Mid-band employee: PAYE + pension on a 12,000 ETB basic salary

**Input line:**
`30 Hamle 2017 ; CBE ; SALARY RUN ; ABEBE T. BASIC 12,000 ; ETB`

**Reasoning (basic salary = 12,000 ETB, Ethiopian citizen):**
- PAYE band = 10,001–14,000 → 30%, deduction 1,350 (derived). PAYE = 12,000 × 30% − 1,350 = 3,600 − 1,350 = **2,550 ETB**.
- Employee pension = 12,000 × 7% = **840 ETB**.
- Employer pension = 12,000 × 11% = **1,320 ETB**.
- Net pay to employee = 12,000 − 2,550 (PAYE) − 840 (pension) = **8,610 ETB**.
- Total employer cost = 12,000 + 1,320 = **13,320 ETB**.
- Total pension remitted to POESSA = 840 + 1,320 = **2,160 ETB** (= 12,000 × 18%). ✓

**Classification:** Salary debit EXCLUDE from VAT (payroll). PAYE 2,550 remitted to MoR; pension 2,160 remitted to POESSA. Deadlines per Section 6.

### Example 2 -- POESSA pension remittance debit

**Input line:**
`05 Nehase 2017 ; AWASH BANK ; DEBIT ; POESSA PENSION CONTRIB HAMLE ; -2,160.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "POESSA" (pattern 4.1). Amount 2,160 ETB = 18% of a 12,000 ETB basic salary (840 employee + 1,320 employer), consistent with Example 1. This is the monthly pension remittance, due within 30 days of the salary month.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — pension remittance to POESSA.

### Example 3 -- Ministry of Revenue PAYE remittance debit

**Input line:**
`28 Nehase 2017 ; DASHEN BANK ; DEBIT ; MINISTRY OF REVENUE PAYE HAMLE ; -2,550.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "MINISTRY OF REVENUE" / "PAYE" (pattern 4.2). Amount 2,550 ETB reconciles to the PAYE withheld in Example 1 (12,000 × 30% − 1,350). This is the monthly PAYE remittance, NOT a pension payment.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — PAYE remittance to MoR. Do not classify as pension.

### Example 4 -- Exempt low earner (no PAYE)

**Input line:**
`30 Hamle 2017 ; CBE ; SALARY RUN ; KIDAN G. BASIC 2,000 ; ETB`

**Reasoning (basic salary = 2,000 ETB, Ethiopian citizen):**
- PAYE: salary is at the 2,000 ETB exemption threshold → **0 ETB PAYE** (band 0–2,000 is exempt).
- Employee pension = 2,000 × 7% = **140 ETB**.
- Employer pension = 2,000 × 11% = **220 ETB**.
- Net pay = 2,000 − 0 − 140 = **1,860 ETB**.
- Total pension to POESSA = 140 + 220 = **360 ETB** (= 2,000 × 18%). ✓

**Classification:** Salary debit EXCLUDE from VAT. No PAYE due. Pension 360 ETB still remitted — pension has no exemption threshold (note: no floor was found; **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**).

### Example 5 -- Foreign (non-Ethiopian-origin) employee: no pension

**Input line:**
`30 Hamle 2017 ; CBE ; SALARY RUN ; J. SMITH (UK NATIONAL) BASIC 30,000 ; ETB`

**Reasoning (basic salary = 30,000 ETB, non-Ethiopian-origin foreign national):**
- Pension scheme is **not available** to non-Ethiopian-origin foreign nationals → employee pension = 0, employer pension = 0.
- PAYE: band = over 14,000 → 35%, deduction 2,050 (derived). PAYE = 30,000 × 35% − 2,050 = 10,500 − 2,050 = **8,450 ETB**.
- Net pay = 30,000 − 8,450 = **21,550 ETB** (no pension deduction).

**Classification:** Salary debit EXCLUDE from VAT. PAYE 8,450 ETB remitted to MoR. NO pension. Confirm nationality/origin before suppressing the pension deduction (R-ET-1).

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payroll/bank-statement data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 -- Pension formula

```
employee_pension = basic_salary × 7%
employer_pension = basic_salary × 11%
total_pension    = basic_salary × 18%
```
Base = **basic salary**, not total gross with allowances [PwC, Other taxes].

### Rule 2 -- PAYE formula (quick-calc method)

```
PAYE = max(0, monthly_salary × rate − deduction)
```
Rate and deduction come from the band the monthly salary falls in (Section 2.2 / 2.3). Deduction constants are **derived** — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the official MoR schedule]**.

### Rule 3 -- Exemption threshold

The first **2,000 ETB/month** is exempt. Salary at or below 2,000 ETB → 0 PAYE [PwC; Proclamation 1395/2025].

### Rule 4 -- Pension eligibility by citizenship

Mandatory for Ethiopian citizens; optional for Ethiopian-origin foreign nationals; unavailable to other foreign nationals [PwC, Other taxes]. Do not apply the 7%/11% deduction outside eligible categories.

### Rule 5 -- Pension base excludes allowances

Compute pension on basic salary only. Allowances are outside the base unless a reviewer confirms otherwise [PwC, Other taxes].

### Rule 6 -- Remittance deadlines

| Obligation | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pension (employee 7% + employer 11%) | Within 30 days of deduction / last day of salary month | PwC, Other taxes |
| PAYE | By the end of the month following the month income was earned | PwC, Tax administration |

Account for the Ethiopian-calendar offset (~7–8 days vs Gregorian) when mapping deadlines.

### Rule 7 -- Employee return-filing

Employees with **only** employment income are NOT required to file a personal return; the employer's withholding and remittance discharges the obligation [PwC, Tax administration].

### Rule 8 -- Vesting

A retirement pension requires at least **10 years** of contributions [PwC, Other taxes; 2merkato]. Do not promise a pension entitlement below 10 years.

### Rule 9 -- Enforcement after non-payment

After **three months** of unpaid contributions, the Social Security Agency may deduct arrears directly from the employer's bank account [PwC, Other taxes].

### Rule 10 -- Tax year and statute of limitations

Tax year = 8 July – 7 July. Authorities may assess within **5 years** of the declaration filing date [PwC, Tax administration].

---

## Section 7 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When payroll data is ambiguous or circumstances are unclear, flag these for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- Basic salary vs total gross
**Trigger:** only a single "salary" figure is given, with allowances bundled in. **Issue:** pension base is basic salary, not total gross; over-stating the base over-charges 18%. **Action:** request the basic/allowance split; flag for reviewer.

### T2-2 -- Ethiopian-origin foreign national opt-in
**Trigger:** employee is a foreign national of Ethiopian origin. **Issue:** pension is optional, not automatic; deducting 7% without an opt-in election is wrong. **Action:** confirm the election; flag for reviewer.

### T2-3 -- Pension salary cap
**Trigger:** high earner where a ceiling could matter. **Issue:** no statutory cap was found — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**. **Action:** compute uncapped and flag; do not assert a cap exists or does not.

### T2-4 -- Pension arrears / direct bank recovery
**Trigger:** unpaid contributions, especially ≥ three months. **Issue:** the agency may seize from the company bank account; arrears quantum needs a POESSA statement. **Action:** escalate; do not estimate.

### T2-5 -- Public vs private sector
**Trigger:** employer is a government body. **Issue:** the Public Servants' Social Security Agency, not POESSA, applies. **Action:** flag; this skill covers private sector only.

### T2-6 -- PAYE penalties and interest
**Trigger:** late filing/payment. **Issue:** exact penalty/interest figures unconfirmed — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against Proclamation 983/2016]**. **Action:** do not quote definitive figures; escalate. (A 2025 tax-penalty-waiver directive also exists — LexAfrica, May 2025 — and may affect relief.)

## Section 9 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How payroll obligations appear on Ethiopian bank statements

**Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE):**
- Salary run: "SALARY", "NET PAY", or Amharic "ደመወዝ"
- Pension remittance: "POESSA", "PENSION CONTRIB"
- PAYE remittance: "MINISTRY OF REVENUE", "PAYE"

**Awash Bank / Dashen Bank / Bank of Abyssinia:**
- Similar references; pension debits often carry "PENSION" or "POESSA"; PAYE debits carry "MOR" or "REVENUE"

**Key identification tips:**
1. Pension and PAYE remittances are always outgoing (DEBIT).
2. A pension remittance should equal **18% of total contributable basic salaries** for the month (7% employee + 11% employer).
3. A PAYE remittance equals the sum of withheld employee tax for the month.
4. Dates use the **Ethiopian calendar** (Hamle, Nehase, Meskerem …) — convert before testing against Gregorian deadlines.
5. Do not confuse pension (POESSA) with PAYE (MoR), or either with VAT / supplier withholding.

---

## Section 10 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for salary, POESSA, and MoR debits** matching Section 4 patterns.
2. **Reconcile pension:** for each month, pension debit ÷ 18% ≈ total contributable basic salary; employee share = that ÷ 18% × 7%, employer share × 11%.
3. **Reconcile PAYE:** PAYE debit should equal the sum of `gross × rate − deduction` across employees (Section 2.3).
4. **Flag eligibility unknowns:** "Pension applied assuming all staff are Ethiopian citizens. Citizenship/origin not independently verified — reviewer must confirm before relying on the 7%/11% split."
5. **Flag every [RESEARCH GAP]:** derived PAYE deductions, pension cap, and penalty figures are unconfirmed.

## Section 11 -- Reference material

### Calculation examples (post-July-2025 regime; ETB, monthly)

| Basic salary | Band / rate | PAYE (gross×rate−ded.) | Employee 7% | Employer 11% | Net pay (citizen) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2,000 | 0% | 0 | 140 | 220 | 1,860 |
| 4,000 | 15% (ded. 300) | 300 | 280 | 440 | 3,420 |
| 7,000 | 20% (ded. 500) | 900 | 490 | 770 | 5,610 |
| 10,000 | 25% (ded. 850) | 1,650 | 700 | 1,100 | 7,650 |
| 14,000 | 30% (ded. 1,350) | 2,850 | 980 | 1,540 | 10,170 |
| 30,000 | 35% (ded. 2,050) | 8,450 | 2,100 | 3,300 | 19,450 |

*Net pay = basic − PAYE − employee 7%. Recomputed: 4,000 − 300 − 280 = 3,420 ✓; 7,000 − 900 − 490 = 5,610 ✓; 10,000 − 1,650 − 700 = 7,650 ✓; 14,000 − 2,850 − 980 = 10,170 ✓; 30,000 − 8,450 − 2,100 = 19,450 ✓. PAYE deductions are DERIVED — reviewer to confirm.*

### Minimum wage

- **No national/private-sector statutory minimum wage** in Ethiopia; private pay is set by contract and collective bargaining. A national assessment is underway but not enacted [RemotePeople; minimum-wage.org].
- Public-sector reference only: minimum government salary raised to **6,000 ETB/month** (~Sept 2025); entry-level bachelor's-degree starting salary raised to 11,500 ETB [BirrMetrics]. Not applicable to private-sector PAYE/pension.

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Citizen, basic 12,000 ETB. → PAYE = 12,000×30% − 1,350 = **2,550**. Employee 7% = **840**. Employer 11% = **1,320**. Pension total = **2,160**. Net = **8,610**.

**Test 2:** Citizen, basic 2,000 ETB. → PAYE = **0** (exempt band). Employee 7% = **140**. Employer 11% = **220**. Net = **1,860**.

**Test 3:** Citizen, basic 7,000 ETB. → PAYE = 7,000×20% − 500 = **900**. Employee 7% = **490**. Employer 11% = **770**. Net = **5,610**.

**Test 4:** Citizen, basic 30,000 ETB. → PAYE = 30,000×35% − 2,050 = **8,450**. Employee 7% = **2,100**. Employer 11% = **3,300**. Net = **19,450**.

**Test 5:** Non-Ethiopian-origin foreign national, basic 30,000 ETB. → Pension EXCLUDED (0 / 0). PAYE = **8,450**. Net = **21,550**.

**Test 6:** Citizen, basic 4,000 ETB. → PAYE = 4,000×15% − 300 = **300**. Employee 7% = **280**. Employer 11% = **440**. Net = **3,420**.

**Test 7:** Employer fails to remit pension for 3 months. → Social Security Agency may deduct arrears directly from the company bank account; escalate (R-ET-3).

**Test 8:** Employee with only employment income asks if they must file a return. → No; employer withholding discharges the obligation (Rule 7).

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the 7%/11% pension deduction without confirming the employee is an Ethiopian citizen (or Ethiopian-origin foreign national who opted in).
- NEVER compute pension on total gross including allowances — the base is basic salary.
- NEVER assert a pension salary cap (or its absence) as fact — it is a [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER present the derived PAYE deduction constants as officially published — they are arithmetic derivations pending MoR confirmation.
- NEVER quote an exact PAYE penalty/interest figure as definitive — those figures are unconfirmed.
- NEVER apply the old (pre-July-2025) seven-band schedule or the 600 ETB threshold — they are superseded by Proclamation 1395/2025.
- NEVER tell a low earner they pay no pension because PAYE is zero — PAYE exemption ≠ pension exemption.
- NEVER map Ethiopian-calendar dates to Gregorian deadlines without converting the ~7–8 day offset.
- NEVER conflate POESSA pension remittances with MoR PAYE remittances on a bank statement.
- NEVER promise a retirement pension entitlement below 10 years of contributions.
