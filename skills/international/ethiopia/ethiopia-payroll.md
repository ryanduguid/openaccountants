## Section 2 -- Employment Income Tax (PAYE / Schedule "A")

The employer withholds employment income tax monthly under Schedule "A". Employees whose only income is employment income do **NOT** file a personal return -- the employer's monthly withholding and remittance is final.

### Monthly tax brackets (effective 7 July 2025, FY 2025/26)

| Monthly taxable salary (ETB) | Marginal rate | Quick-deduction constant (ETB) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,000 | 0% (exempt) | 0 |
| 2,001 -- 4,000 | 15% | 300 |
| 4,001 -- 7,000 | 20% | 500 |
| 7,001 -- 10,000 | 25% | 850 |
| 10,001 -- 14,000 | 30% | 1,350 |
| Over 14,000 | 35% | 2,050 |

**Bracket / rate source:** PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Ethiopia, Taxes on personal income (reviewed 18 Dec 2025); TaxDev (IFS) "Ethiopia's revised income tax explained"; Afriwise (Proc. No. 1395/2025, effective 7 July 2025).

**Quick-deduction constants:** Derived arithmetically from the marginal brackets so that `tax = salary x rate - constant` reproduces the cumulative bracket tax exactly (see Section 11 self-check). These constants are **not** published in the gazetted text. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm against the gazetted proclamation; some payroll vendors publish identical constants but they are derived, not statutory.]**

### Key facts and 2025 reform changes

- Tax-free threshold **raised from ETB 600 to ETB 2,000/month** (PwC; TaxDev).
- Brackets reduced from **seven to six**; the **old 10% lowest taxable band was removed** -- the lowest taxable rate is now **15%**. (Some secondary summaries still quote "10%--35%"; that is the pre-reform schedule and is outdated. The 15% lowest rate is the current PwC table.)
- Top rate **35%** unchanged but now begins above **ETB 14,000/month** (PwC).
- Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Ethiopian-source income; the **same Schedule A rates apply to both** (PwC, Taxes on personal income).
- No published per-bracket personal relief/allowance for employment income beyond the ETB 2,000 exempt band -- tax is computed bracket-by-bracket. **[RESEARCH GAP -- the official annual-equivalent bracket table is not published by PwC; only monthly is confirmed.]**

### Computation method (per pay run)

```
taxable_salary  = gross taxable employment income for the month
                  (cash salary + taxable allowances/benefits)
PAYE            = taxable_salary x marginal_rate - quick_deduction_constant
                  (apply the row whose range contains taxable_salary)
```

PAYE is **not** cumulative across the year (unlike Malta's FSS) -- each month is computed standalone on that month's taxable salary.

---

## Section 3 -- Pension / Social Security Contributions

**Scheme:** Private Organisation Employees' Social Security, administered by **POESSA** (Private Organisation Employees Social Security Agency). A parallel scheme covers government employees. The contribution base is **basic salary** (not gross; excludes allowances/overtime), per PwC.

### Contribution rates

| Party | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 7% | Basic salary |
| Employer | 11% | Basic salary |
| **Combined total** | **18%** | Basic salary |

**Self-check:** employee 7% + employer 11% = **18%** combined. Confirmed.

**Source:** PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Ethiopia, Other taxes (employee 7%, employer 11%, base = basic salary, no ceiling stated).

### Coverage and mechanics

- Mandatory for **Ethiopian citizens**; optional for foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin; **not available to other foreign nationals / expats** (PwC).
- The **employer remits both portions** (employee 7% withheld + employer 11%).
- Funds old-age pension, survivors', and work-injury / invalidity benefits.

### Contribution ceiling

- **PwC (primary source) states there is NO ceiling** on the contribution base.
- Several secondary payroll guides (e.g. Multiplier, Playroll) cite a **maximum insurable earning of ETB 15,000/month** (which would cap combined contributions at ETB 2,700/month). This **could not be confirmed from a primary authoritative source** (the ISSA country-profile PDF returned HTTP 403). **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm whether a POESSA directive imposes an ETB 15,000/month insurable-earnings ceiling. Default below applies NO ceiling, per PwC.]**

---

## Section 4 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag them in the output:

| Input | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Residency / source | Treat as **resident**, taxed on the stated employment income | Same Schedule A rates apply either way; no rate difference |
| Pension eligibility | Treat employee as an **Ethiopian citizen** (pension applies) unless told otherwise | Pension is mandatory for citizens; assuming it applies is the conservative (higher-cost) stance |
| Pension base | Use **basic salary only**; if only "gross" is given, **ask** before assuming the whole amount is basic | Contributions on too-large a base over-deduct; PwC base = basic salary |
| Pension ceiling | Apply **no ceiling** (PwC) | Primary source says no ceiling; do not silently cap at 15,000 |
| Taxable vs non-taxable allowances | Treat all stated allowances as **taxable** unless a specific exemption is provided | Avoids understating PAYE |
| Pay frequency | Assume **monthly** | Standard Ethiopian practice |
| PAYE remittance date | Use **end of the following month** (PwC) and FLAG the 8th-day discrepancy | See Section 8 |

Never present any computed figure as definitive -- always label it estimated and direct to a licensed Ethiopian accountant.

---

## Section 5 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before any payroll computation

1. **Gross monthly employment income** (ETB), with a breakdown of **basic salary vs allowances/benefits**.
2. Which allowances are **taxable** vs exempt (if any exemption is claimed).
3. Whether the employee is an **Ethiopian citizen** (or foreign national of Ethiopian origin) for pension eligibility.
4. Pay period (month/year).
5. Any non-employment income? (If yes -> employee may need to file separately; this skill covers employment income only.)

### Refusal catalogue -- DO NOT compute; ask first

| Situation | Why refuse / pause |
|---|---|
| Only "gross salary" given, no basic-salary split | Pension base is basic salary; computing on gross over-deducts. Ask for the split. |
| Employee is a non-Ethiopian expat and pension treatment is unclear | Pension generally not available to expats; do not deduct 7%/11% without confirmation. |
| Request to compute the ETB 15,000 ceiling effect as if it were law | Ceiling is unconfirmed; do not present it as authoritative. |
| Request for the annual-equivalent bracket table as a definitive figure | Annual table not published; do not fabricate it. |
| Request for exact late-filing / late-payment penalty amounts | Penalty figures not in any primary source available; do not invent. |
| Request to treat the lowest band as 10% | Outdated pre-reform rate; refuse and use 15% (post-7-July-2025). |

---

## Section 6 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic mapping from posting context to bookkeeping treatment. Amounts are illustrative; classifications are the deliverable.

| Event | Debit | Credit |
|---|---|---|
| Accrue gross salary | Salary expense (gross) | Net pay payable; PAYE payable; Pension payable (employee 7%) |
| Accrue employer pension (11%) | Pension expense (employer) | Pension payable (employer 11%) |
| Pay net salary to employee | Net pay payable | Bank |
| Remit PAYE to Ministry of Revenue | PAYE payable | Bank |
| Remit pension (18% combined) to POESSA | Pension payable (7% + 11%) | Bank |

**Treatment rules:**
- Gross salary and employer pension (11%) are **expenses**.
- Employee PAYE and employee pension (7%) are **liabilities withheld** -- they reduce net pay, not employer cost.
- Net pay = gross taxable salary - PAYE - employee pension (7% of basic salary).

---

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples

All figures in **ETB**. Bank lines mimic realistic Ethiopian statement narrations (e.g. CBE = Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, Awash, Dashen, telebirr). PAYE uses Section 2 brackets; pension uses Section 3 (no ceiling).

### Example 1 -- Low earner, fully exempt PAYE

- Basic salary = gross taxable = **ETB 2,000/month**.
- PAYE: salary is in 0--2,000 band -> **0% -> ETB 0**.
- Employee pension: 2,000 x 7% = **ETB 140**.
- Net pay = 2,000 - 0 - 140 = **ETB 1,860**.
- Employer pension: 2,000 x 11% = **ETB 220**.
- Employer total cost = 2,000 + 220 = **ETB 2,220**.

Bank line (net): `CBE TRANSFER DEBIT - DAMTEW W SALARY JUNE - 1,860.00` -> Net salary payment.

### Example 2 -- Mid earner, 20% band

- Basic salary = gross taxable = **ETB 6,000/month**.
- PAYE: in 4,001--7,000 band -> 6,000 x 20% - 500 = 1,200 - 500 = **ETB 700**.
  - Cross-check by bracket: (4,000-2,000)x15% + (6,000-4,000)x20% = 300 + 400 = **700**. Reconciles.
- Employee pension: 6,000 x 7% = **ETB 420**.
- Net pay = 6,000 - 700 - 420 = **ETB 4,880**.
- Employer pension: 6,000 x 11% = **ETB 660**.
- Employer total cost = 6,000 + 660 = **ETB 6,660**.

Bank lines:
- `AWASH BANK PAYROLL CR - NETSALARY - 4,880.00` -> Net salary.
- `MOR PAYE REMIT FORM17 - 700.00` -> PAYE to Ministry of Revenue.
- `POESSA PENSION 18% - 1,080.00` -> Pension remittance (420 + 660).

### Example 3 -- Allowances split (taxable allowance, pension on basic only)

- Basic salary = **ETB 10,000**; taxable transport allowance = **ETB 2,000**. Gross taxable = **ETB 12,000**.
- PAYE on 12,000: in 10,001--14,000 band -> 12,000 x 30% - 1,350 = 3,600 - 1,350 = **ETB 2,250**.
  - Bracket cross-check: 300 + 600 + 750 + (12,000-10,000)x30% = 300+600+750+600 = 2,250. Reconciles.
- Employee pension on **basic only** (10,000): 10,000 x 7% = **ETB 700**.
- Net pay = 12,000 - 2,250 - 700 = **ETB 9,050**.
- Employer pension on basic only: 10,000 x 11% = **ETB 1,100**.
- Employer total cost = 12,000 + 1,100 = **ETB 13,100**.

Note: pension is on basic salary (10,000), NOT on the 2,000 allowance.

### Example 4 -- High earner, top 35% band

- Basic salary = gross taxable = **ETB 30,000/month**.
- PAYE: over 14,000 -> 30,000 x 35% - 2,050 = 10,500 - 2,050 = **ETB 8,450**.
  - Bracket cross-check: cumulative tax at 14,000 = 2,850; plus (30,000-14,000)x35% = 5,600; total = **8,450**. Reconciles.
- Employee pension (no ceiling, PwC): 30,000 x 7% = **ETB 2,100**.
- Net pay = 30,000 - 8,450 - 2,100 = **ETB 19,450**.
- Employer pension: 30,000 x 11% = **ETB 3,300**.
- Employer total cost = 30,000 + 3,300 = **ETB 33,300**.

**[RESEARCH GAP]** If a confirmed ETB 15,000 insurable-earnings ceiling existed, employee pension would cap at 15,000 x 7% = 1,050 and employer at 15,000 x 11% = 1,650 (combined 2,700). This skill does **not** apply that cap by default (PwC says no ceiling).

### Example 5 -- Boundary at exactly ETB 7,000 (band edge)

- Gross taxable = **ETB 7,000** (top of the 20% band).
- PAYE: 7,000 x 20% - 500 = 1,400 - 500 = **ETB 900**.
  - Bracket cross-check: 300 + (7,000-4,000)x20% = 300 + 600 = 900. Reconciles.
- Employee pension: 7,000 x 7% = **ETB 490**.
- Net pay = 7,000 - 900 - 490 = **ETB 5,610**.
- Employer pension: 7,000 x 11% = **ETB 770**.

## Section 8 -- Filing and Remittance Obligations

| Item | Detail | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly declaration (Form 17) | Gross salaries, employer + employee pension, income tax withheld, net paid | Monthly |
| PAYE remittance to Ministry of Revenue | Withheld employment income tax | **End of the month following** the month income was earned (PwC) |
| Pension remittance to POESSA | Combined 18% (7% employee + 11% employer) | **Within 30 days** of deduction |
| Personal annual return | **Not required** for employees with only employment income -- employer withholding is final | N/A |

**[RESEARCH GAP -- remittance-day discrepancy]:** PwC states PAYE is due by **the end of the following month**. Several secondary guides cite the **8th day** (or last day) of the following month. This skill defaults to **end of the following month** (PwC) but the reviewer must confirm the exact statutory day against the Federal Tax Administration Proclamation No. 983/2016.

**Calendar note:** Ethiopia uses the Ethiopian calendar (~7--8 day lag from Gregorian); confirm the effective Gregorian due date when scheduling payments.

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Ethiopia, Tax administration; Rivermate -- Employment taxes in Ethiopia (Form 17).

---

## Section 9 -- Employer Registration

- Employers -- including **foreign companies employing staff in Ethiopia even without a permanent establishment** -- must register with the Ministry of Revenue as an employer to withhold and remit PAYE (Rivermate; PwC).
- **No published de-minimis revenue/headcount threshold** for PAYE -- the obligation arises on employing staff. **[RESEARCH GAP -- no authoritative threshold located.]**

---

## Section 10 -- Penalties

Governed by the **Federal Tax Administration Proclamation No. 983/2016** (still in force):

| Article | Subject | Classification |
|---|---|---|
| Art. 104 | Late filing of returns | High-level penalty |
| Art. 105 | Late payment of tax | Medium-level penalty |
| Art. 109 | Understatement of tax | Low-level penalty |

- **New cash-transaction penalty (Proc. 1395/2025):** cash payments over **ETB 50,000** made outside electronic/cheque channels attract a penalty equal to **twice the amount paid** (PwC, Significant developments).
- **Statute of limitations:** the tax authority may pursue unpaid tax for **5 years** from the filing date (PwC).

**[RESEARCH GAP -- exact penalty amounts]:** The specific ETB-per-month late-filing figures, late-payment percentages, and interest rates under Articles 104/105 could not be extracted from a primary source (the Proc. 983/2016 PDF was unparseable; PwC does not state the rates). Reviewer must read the gazetted text of Arts. 104/105/110.

Source: PwC -- Significant developments; Proclamation 983/2016 (gazetted text, not machine-readable via fetch).

---

## Section 11 -- Minimum Wage

- **No national / private-sector statutory minimum wage** exists in Ethiopia (RemotePeople; WageIndicator).
- A **Wage Board** (government, employers, unions) is provided for under the Labour Proclamation to set/revise minimum wages periodically; **not yet operational for the private sector**.
- **Public sector only** (does NOT apply to private payroll): a long-standing federal reference of **ETB 420/month** (unchanged since ~2012); some sources report a civil-servant minimum raised toward the **ETB ~4,800/month** range. **[RESEARCH GAP -- the current civil-servant figure varies by source; not applicable to private employers regardless.]**

Source: RemotePeople -- Minimum wage Ethiopia; WageIndicator -- Ethiopia; Capital Ethiopia (July 2025).

---

## Section 12 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic -- always apply)

1. Apply the **post-7-July-2025** Schedule A brackets (lowest taxable rate 15%, top 35% above ETB 14,000). NEVER use the pre-reform 10% lowest band.
2. PAYE is computed **per month, standalone** -- not cumulative across the year.
3. Pension is **employee 7% / employer 11%** on **basic salary only** (exclude allowances/overtime).
4. The **employer remits both** the 7% and 11% pension portions (combined 18%).
5. Net pay = gross taxable salary - PAYE - employee pension (7% of basic).
6. Apply **no pension ceiling** by default (PwC); only apply a ceiling if the reviewer confirms one.
7. All amounts in **ETB**.
8. Employees with only employment income do **not** file a personal return.

---

## Section 13 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

| Question | Why it needs a reviewer |
|---|---|
| Is a particular allowance (transport, housing, per-diem) taxable or exempt? | Exemption treatment varies; not exhaustively published here. |
| Does an ETB 15,000 pension ceiling apply? | Unconfirmed; reviewer to check POESSA directive. |
| Exact PAYE remittance day (end of month vs 8th)? | Source discrepancy; reviewer to confirm statute. |
| Quick-deduction constants vs gazetted text | Constants are derived, not statutory; reviewer to confirm. |
| Pension treatment for foreign nationals of Ethiopian origin | Optional scheme; case-specific. |
| Exact penalty / interest figures | Not in available primary sources. |
| Annual-equivalent bracket table | Not published; do not fabricate. |

---

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client cannot provide a clean basic-vs-allowance split or pension-eligibility confirmation:
1. Request the **employment contract** (states basic salary) and the latest **Form 17** if one exists.
2. Confirm **citizenship/residency** for pension eligibility.
3. In the interim, compute PAYE on the stated gross taxable figure and **flag** that pension may be mis-stated until the basic-salary split is confirmed.
4. Do not finalise or file until the reviewer signs off.

## Section 18 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputes end-to-end. PAYE per Section 2; pension per Section 3 (no ceiling); net = gross taxable - PAYE - employee pension (7% of basic). Where gross = basic, pension base = gross.

1. **Gross taxable ETB 2,000, basic 2,000.** PAYE = 0 (exempt band). Employee pension = 140. Net = 2,000 - 0 - 140 = **1,860**. Employer pension = 220.
2. **Gross taxable ETB 4,000, basic 4,000.** PAYE = 4,000 x 15% - 300 = 600 - 300 = **300**. Pension (emp) = 280. Net = 4,000 - 300 - 280 = **3,420**. Employer pension = 440.
3. **Gross taxable ETB 6,000, basic 6,000.** PAYE = 6,000 x 20% - 500 = **700**. Pension = 420. Net = 6,000 - 700 - 420 = **4,880**. Employer pension = 660.
4. **Gross taxable ETB 7,000, basic 7,000.** PAYE = 7,000 x 20% - 500 = **900**. Pension = 490. Net = 7,000 - 900 - 490 = **5,610**.
5. **Gross taxable ETB 10,000, basic 10,000.** PAYE = 10,000 x 25% - 850 = 2,500 - 850 = **1,650**. Pension = 700. Net = 10,000 - 1,650 - 700 = **7,650**. Employer pension = 1,100.
6. **Gross taxable ETB 12,000, basic 10,000 (allowance 2,000).** PAYE = 12,000 x 30% - 1,350 = **2,250**. Pension on basic = 10,000 x 7% = 700. Net = 12,000 - 2,250 - 700 = **9,050**. Employer pension = 1,100.
7. **Gross taxable ETB 14,000, basic 14,000.** PAYE = 14,000 x 30% - 1,350 = 4,200 - 1,350 = **2,850**. Pension = 980. Net = 14,000 - 2,850 - 980 = **10,170**.
8. **Gross taxable ETB 30,000, basic 30,000.** PAYE = 30,000 x 35% - 2,050 = **8,450**. Pension = 2,100. Net = 30,000 - 8,450 - 2,100 = **19,450**. Employer pension = 3,300.
9. **Cumulative-tax consistency check:** cumulative tax at each band edge = 0 (2,000), 300 (4,000), 900 (7,000), 1,650 (10,000), 2,850 (14,000). Each equals `edge x rate - constant` for its band. Confirmed.
10. **Pension combined check:** for any basic B, employee 0.07B + employer 0.11B = 0.18B. Confirmed.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER use the pre-reform 10% lowest band -- the lowest taxable rate is 15% (effective 7 July 2025).
- NEVER compute pension on gross/allowances -- use **basic salary only**.
- NEVER omit the employer's 11% pension portion -- the employer remits both 7% and 11%.
- NEVER silently apply an ETB 15,000 pension ceiling -- it is unconfirmed; PwC says no ceiling.
- NEVER treat PAYE as cumulative across the year -- it is computed standalone each month.
- NEVER deduct pension for a non-Ethiopian expat without confirming eligibility.
- NEVER present the quick-deduction constants as statutory -- they are derived.
- NEVER invent exact penalty amounts or the annual bracket table -- mark as research gaps.
- NEVER state a single remittance day as certain -- flag the end-of-month vs 8th discrepancy.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Ethiopian accountant.
