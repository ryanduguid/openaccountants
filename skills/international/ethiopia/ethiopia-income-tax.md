## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Ethiopia (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia) |
| Tax | Income Tax (PAYE on employment; Schedule B/C/D on other income) |
| Currency | Ethiopian Birr (ETB) only |
| Tax year (fiscal) | 8 July -- 7 July (Hamle 1 -- Sene 30, Ethiopian calendar) |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Proclamation No. 979/2016, as amended by Income Tax (Amendment) Proclamation No. 1395/2025 (effective 8 July 2025) |
| Supporting legislation | Tax Administration Proclamation No. 983/2016; VAT Proclamation No. 1341/2024 + Regulation 570/2025; Private Organizations Employees' Pension law (POESSA) |
| Tax authority | Ministry of Revenues (MOR), `mor.gov.et` (formerly ERCA) |

**Calendar caution.** The Ethiopian calendar runs ~7–8 days behind the Gregorian calendar. Statutory "month-end" deadlines therefore tend to land around the 7th–8th of the following Gregorian month. Always confirm the exact Gregorian date against the Ethiopian month boundary.

### PAYE — Monthly Employment Income Brackets (effective 8 July 2025)

Source: PwC *Taxes on personal income* (Ethiopia); MyWorkpay; PaySpace; EY tax alert 2025-2542. Brackets/rates are authoritative.

| Monthly taxable income (ETB) | Marginal rate | Quick-calc deduction (ETB) | Cumulative tax at band ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,000 | 0% (exempt) | — | 0 |
| 2,001 – 4,000 | 15% | 300 | 300 |
| 4,001 – 7,000 | 20% | 500 | 900 |
| 7,001 – 10,000 | 25% | 850 | 1,650 |
| 10,001 – 14,000 | 30% | 1,350 | 2,850 |
| Over 14,000 | 35% | 2,050 | — |

**PAYE formula:** `Monthly tax = (Gross monthly taxable salary × band rate) − quick-calc deduction`.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The quick-calc deduction column (300 / 500 / 850 / 1,350 / 2,050) is **derived by computation** from the published cumulative-tax figures (0 / 300 / 900 / 1,650 / 2,850), using the standard progressive identity. The math reconciles exactly, but the deduction constants were **not found stated verbatim** in an authoritative source. The brackets and marginal rates themselves ARE authoritative. The OLD pre-2025 deductions (60 / 142.50 / 302.50 / 565 / 955 / 1,500) are obsolete — do not use them.

**Changes vs. prior law (Proclamation 1395/2025):** tax-free threshold raised ETB 600 → ETB 2,000/month; lowest positive rate raised 10% → 15%; brackets cut 7 → 6; the 35% top rate now applies above ETB 14,000 (previously above 10,900). Source: MyWorkpay; PaySpace.

**Residence/scope:** Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Ethiopian-source income; the same rate schedule applies (PwC, *Taxes on personal income*).

### Business / Self-Employed (Schedule C) — Annual Progressive Rates

Source: YSA Law Office (Proclamation 1395/2025 overview); PwC *Significant developments*. Annual thresholds = monthly employment bands × 12.

| Annual taxable business income (ETB) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 24,000 | 0% |
| 24,001 – 48,000 | 15% |
| 48,001 – 84,000 | 20% |
| 84,001 – 120,000 | 25% |
| 120,001 – 168,000 | 30% |
| Over 168,000 | 30% (REDUCED from 35% by 1395/2025) |

### Rental Income (Schedule B) — Annual Progressive Rates

Source: EY tax alert 2025-2542; YSA Law Office.

| Annual taxable rental income (ETB) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 24,000 | 0% |
| 24,001 – 48,000 | 15% |
| 48,001 – 84,000 | 20% |
| 84,001 – 120,000 | 25% |
| 120,001 – 168,000 | 30% |
| Over 168,000 | 30% (reduced from 35%) |

### Category B — Turnover / Gross-Sales Tax (presumptive)

Applies to non-professional, non-VAT-registered Category B individuals (turnover below ETB 2,000,000). Source: EY tax alert 2025-2542.

| Annual gross sales (ETB) | Rate on turnover |
|---|---|
| 0 – 100,000 | 2% |
| 100,001 – 500,000 | 3% |
| 500,001 – 1,000,000 | 5% |
| 1,000,001 – 1,500,000 | 7% |
| 1,500,001 – 2,000,000 | 9% |

### Pension Contributions (Private Organizations Employees' Pension)

Source: PwC *Other taxes*; 2merkato; countrytaxcalc.

| Party | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 7% | basic/gross salary, normal working hours |
| Employer | 11% | same base |
| **Total** | **18%** | |

Arithmetic check: 7% + 11% = **18%**. ✓ Mandatory for Ethiopian citizens; foreign nationals are NOT required to contribute (optional for foreigners of Ethiopian origin only).

### Other Headline Rates

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Capital gains tax | 15% on disposal of assets (unchanged by 1395/2025) | EY tax alert 2025-2542 |
| Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT) | 2.5% of annual turnover if computed income tax is lower | MyWorkpay; EY alert |

| Statute of limitations (assessment) | 5 years from declaration filing | PwC *Tax administration* |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residence status | STOP — confirm resident vs non-resident before applying scope |
| Unknown citizenship (for pension) | STOP — pension obligation depends on Ethiopian citizenship |
| Unknown taxpayer category (A vs B) | Treat as Category A (full books) unless turnover confirmed < ETB 2,000,000 |
| Unknown whether individual is a "listed professional" | Treat as Category A (professionals are always Category A) |
| Unknown pension salary base | Use basic/gross salary; flag the ceiling question (see RESEARCH GAP) |
| Unknown income schedule (employment/business/rental) | STOP — schedule determines the rate table and periodicity |
| Unknown expense business-purpose | Not deductible |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — for employment: monthly gross salary (basic + taxable allowances), citizenship (for pension), residence status. For business/rental: the relevant statements/ledgers for the full fiscal year, plus taxpayer category and turnover.

**Recommended** — payslips, employment contract, pension remittance records, prior-year tax declaration, VAT registration status, breakdown of allowances (which are taxable vs exempt).

**Ideal** — full income and expenditure account, asset register, advance-tax payment confirmations, audited financials (Category A).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No salary/income figures at all = hard stop. Salary without an allowance breakdown = proceed with reviewer warning: "PAYE was computed treating all stated pay as taxable. The reviewer must confirm which allowances are statutorily exempt before filing."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-ET-1 — Residence status unknown.** "Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Ethiopian-source income. This skill cannot scope income without confirmed residence status. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-ET-2 — Companies / legal persons.** "This skill covers individuals (employees, sole proprietors, landlords). Corporate income tax (30% on companies) and Category A legal-person filings require separate analysis. Escalate to an Ethiopian tax practitioner."

**R-ET-3 — Schedule D investment income.** "Dividend, interest, and royalty withholding (Schedule D) rates were not re-verified in this build and must be confirmed against Proclamation 979/2016 / MOR before computing. Escalate or confirm the rate first."

**R-ET-4 — Penalties / enforcement / arrears.** "Late-filing, late-payment interest, and under-declaration penalty figures are not confirmed in this skill. Do not state penalty numbers. Escalate to an Ethiopian tax practitioner."

**R-ET-5 — VAT return requested.** "This skill covers income tax only. VAT (15%, Proclamation 1341/2024) is out of scope here."

**R-ET-6 — Pension ceiling-dependent computation.** "Several sources report an ETB 15,000/month pension salary cap, but it is not confirmed against POESSA/the proclamation. For high earners where the cap changes the result, flag the figure for reviewer confirmation rather than asserting it."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in ETB. PAYE computed as `(gross taxable salary × band rate) − quick-calc deduction`. Employee pension = 7% of basic/gross salary, deducted in addition to PAYE to reach net pay.

### Example 1 — Low earner (15% band)

**Input line:**
`Hamle 2018 ; PAYROLL ; DEMOZ ; gross salary ; +3,000.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
Gross taxable salary 3,000 falls in the 2,001–4,000 band (15%, deduction 300).
PAYE = 3,000 × 0.15 − 300 = 450 − 300 = **150**.
Employee pension = 3,000 × 7% = **210**.
Net pay = 3,000 − 150 − 210 = **2,640**.

**Classification:** PAYE 150; pension 210; net 2,640.

### Example 2 — Mid earner (20% band)

**Input line:**
`Nehase 2018 ; PAYROLL ; DEMOZ ; gross salary ; +6,000.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
6,000 is in the 4,001–7,000 band (20%, deduction 500).
PAYE = 6,000 × 0.20 − 500 = 1,200 − 500 = **700**.
Pension = 6,000 × 7% = **420**.
Net pay = 6,000 − 700 − 420 = **4,880**.

**Classification:** PAYE 700; pension 420; net 4,880.

### Example 3 — Upper-mid earner (30% band)

**Input line:**
`Meskerem 2018 ; PAYROLL ; DEMOZ ; gross salary ; +12,000.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
12,000 is in the 10,001–14,000 band (30%, deduction 1,350).
PAYE = 12,000 × 0.30 − 1,350 = 3,600 − 1,350 = **2,250**.
Pension = 12,000 × 7% = **840**.
Net pay = 12,000 − 2,250 − 840 = **8,910**.

**Classification:** PAYE 2,250; pension 840; net 8,910.

### Example 4 — High earner (35% top band; pension ceiling flagged)

**Input line:**
`Tikimt 2018 ; PAYROLL ; DEMOZ ; gross salary ; +20,000.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
20,000 is over 14,000 (35%, deduction 2,050).
PAYE = 20,000 × 0.35 − 2,050 = 7,000 − 2,050 = **4,950**.
Pension: if NO ceiling, 20,000 × 7% = 1,400 → net = 20,000 − 4,950 − 1,400 = **13,650**.
Pension: if the widely-reported ETB 15,000 ceiling applies, 15,000 × 7% = 1,050 → net = 20,000 − 4,950 − 1,050 = **14,000**.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The pension salary ceiling (reported as ETB 15,000/month) is not verified against POESSA/the proclamation. For earners above the cap this changes net pay. Present both figures and flag for reviewer.

**Classification:** PAYE 4,950; pension 1,050–1,400 (ceiling-dependent); net 13,650–14,000.

### Example 5 — Exempt earner (below threshold)

**Input line:**
`Hidar 2018 ; PAYROLL ; DEMOZ ; gross salary ; +2,000.00 ; ETB`

**Reasoning:**
2,000 is within the 0% band (0–2,000), so PAYE = **0**.
Pension still applies: 2,000 × 7% = **140**.
Net pay = 2,000 − 0 − 140 = **1,860**.

**Classification:** PAYE 0; pension 140; net 1,860.

### Example 6 — Sole proprietor (Schedule C annual)

**Input:** Category A individual consultant, annual taxable business income ETB 200,000 (turnover ETB 600,000).

**Reasoning:**
Schedule C is progressive on annual taxable income. Over 168,000 → top rate 30% (reduced from 35%).
Tax via the same progressive identity, top band: 200,000 falls over 168,000.
Cumulative tax to 168,000 = (24k@0) + (24k@15%=3,600) + (36k@20%=7,200) + (36k@25%=9,000) + (48k@30%=14,400) = 34,200.
Excess 200,000 − 168,000 = 32,000 × 30% = 9,600.
Income tax = 34,200 + 9,600 = **43,800**.
MAT check: 2.5% × turnover 600,000 = 15,000. Income tax 43,800 > 15,000, so MAT does not bite.

**Classification:** Schedule C income tax = 43,800 (MAT not triggered).

> Cumulative-tax arithmetic verified: 3,600 + 7,200 + 9,000 + 14,400 = 34,200 at ETB 168,000. ✓

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 PAYE Computation (Employment)

`Monthly PAYE = (gross monthly taxable salary × band rate) − quick-calc deduction`. The 0–2,000 band is exempt. Employer is responsible for withholding and monthly remittance. Source: PwC *Taxes on personal income*.

### 5.2 Taxable vs Exempt Allowances

Not all allowances are taxable. Some (e.g. certain transport, hardship, or per-diem allowances within statutory limits) are exempt. Treat all stated pay as taxable by default, and flag the exempt-allowance question for reviewer confirmation against Proclamation 979/2016. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact exempt-allowance limits.]**

### 5.3 Schedule Selection

| Income type | Schedule | Periodicity | Rate table |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employment | "A" (PAYE) | Monthly | Section 1 monthly bands |
| Rental | "B" | Annual | Section 1 rental table |
| Business (individual, keeping books) | "C" | Annual | Section 1 business table |
| Investment (dividend/interest/royalty) | "D" | Withholding | [RESEARCH GAP — confirm Schedule D rates] |

### 5.4 Taxpayer Categories (Proclamation 1395/2025)

- **Category A:** all legal persons (companies) regardless of turnover; any individual/business with annual turnover **> ETB 2,000,000**; and **all listed professionals** (accountants, lawyers, engineers, etc.) regardless of turnover. Full books required. Source: EY alert 2025-2542; apexfinancials.et.
- **Category B:** unincorporated individuals with annual turnover **below ETB 2,000,000**, excluding listed professionals and VAT-registered persons.
- **Category C** (old presumptive small-trader category) was **abolished** by 1395/2025.

### 5.5 Category B Turnover Tax

Non-professional, non-VAT-registered Category B individuals pay a presumptive turnover tax on gross sales per the Section 1 turnover table (2% → 9%). Source: EY alert 2025-2542.

### 5.6 Minimum Alternative Tax (MAT)

If income tax computed on business income is below **2.5% of annual turnover**, the taxpayer pays **2.5% of turnover** instead. Applies even where incentives/exemptions exist, and extends to rental and digital side income. Source: MyWorkpay; EY alert.

### 5.7 Pension Contributions

Employee 7% / employer 11% (total 18%) of basic/gross salary for Ethiopian citizens. The employee 7% is withheld and is not part of taxable employment income (deducted before arriving at net pay). Foreign nationals are not required to contribute. Vesting requires a minimum of 10 years' contributions. Remittance is due within 30 days of the relevant month-end. Source: PwC *Other taxes*; 2merkato.

### 5.8 Capital Gains

Disposal of assets is taxed at **15%** (unchanged by 1395/2025). Source: EY alert 2025-2542.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Low earner PAYE.**
Input: gross taxable salary 3,000/month.
Expected: PAYE = 3,000×0.15 − 300 = 150. Pension 210. Net 2,640.

**Test 2 — Mid earner PAYE.**
Input: 6,000/month.
Expected: PAYE = 6,000×0.20 − 500 = 700. Pension 420. Net 4,880.

**Test 3 — Upper-mid PAYE.**
Input: 12,000/month.
Expected: PAYE = 12,000×0.30 − 1,350 = 2,250. Pension 840. Net 8,910.

**Test 4 — Top-band PAYE (no ceiling).**
Input: 20,000/month, no pension cap.
Expected: PAYE = 20,000×0.35 − 2,050 = 4,950. Pension 1,400. Net 13,650.

**Test 5 — Exempt earner.**
Input: 2,000/month.
Expected: PAYE = 0. Pension 140. Net 1,860.

**Test 6 — Schedule C with MAT check.**
Input: annual taxable business income 200,000, turnover 600,000.
Expected: income tax = 34,200 + (32,000×0.30=9,600) = 43,800. MAT = 2.5%×600,000 = 15,000. Tax due = max(43,800, 15,000) = 43,800.

**Test 7 — Category B turnover tax.**
Input: non-professional, non-VAT, annual gross sales 400,000.
Expected: 400,000 falls in 100,001–500,000 band → 3% × 400,000 = 12,000.
