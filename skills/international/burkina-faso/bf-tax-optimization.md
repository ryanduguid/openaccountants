| Regime RNI | >= 50,000,000 FCFA — full accounting, must/may invoice TVA |

## Section 2 -- Regime choice by turnover

**Regime choice by turnover**  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_

| Turnover HT | Regime | Tax basis | TVA |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| < 15,000,000 FCFA | CME | Flat lump sum (class × zone) | No |
| 15,000,000 to < 50,000,000 | RSI | Net profit, brackets 10/20/27.5%; MFP floor 300,000 | No |
| >= 50,000,000 | RNI | Net profit, brackets 10/20/27.5%; MFP floor 1,000,000 | Yes |

- **CME for smallest businesses** — CME for the smallest businesses is usually the lowest-admin, lowest-cost option below 15M FCFA — but it cannot recover input TVA or invoice TVA (a disadvantage when selling to TVA-registered customers who want recoverable input).  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
- **Crossing 50M FCFA threshold** — Crossing 50M FCFA brings TVA obligations — model the cash-flow and pricing impact before growing past the threshold.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
- **Regime change timing** — A taxpayer only drops to a lower regime after staying below the threshold for 3 consecutive years; opting up is by election before 1 February, irrevocable 3 years.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_

## Section 3 -- Centre de Gestion Agréé (CGA)

- **CGA reductions** — Joining an approved management centre yields statutory reductions: 30% off IBICA/IBNC, 50% off the MFP, 25% off the CME, and a 20% abatement on the TPA base. For profitable RNI/RSI businesses the 30% bénéfices reduction is typically the single largest legal lever.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_

## Section 4 -- New-business and other levers

- **New-business MFP exemption** — New-business MFP exemption for the first financial year (CGI Art. 27) — time start-up investment accordingly.  _(CGI Art. 27)_
- **TVA-registration management** — TVA-registration management: only RNI invoices TVA; staying RSI/CME avoids TVA admin but blocks input recovery — choose based on customer mix (B2B TVA-registered vs B2C).  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
- **Profession libérale regime** — Profession libérale → IBNC under RSI/RNI (excluded from CME).  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_

## Section 5 -- Prohibitions

- **No evasion advice** — NEVER advise evasion, under-declaration, or artificial turnover-splitting to stay under a threshold.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
- **No blind CME assumption** — NEVER assume CME is best without checking input-TVA recovery and customer mix.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
- **Prohibition: engine computing numbers** — NEVER compute numbers — the engine handles arithmetic.
- **Confirm current sources** — Confirm thresholds, reductions and option deadlines against current DGI sources.  _(CGI (Loi 058-2017/AN) Art. 13–27, 197, 527–538)_
