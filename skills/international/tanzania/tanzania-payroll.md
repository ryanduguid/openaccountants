## Tanzania Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified) — NOT yet accountant-verified.** A small number of figures carry `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` markers (notably the full sectoral minimum-wage schedule, the floating late-payment interest rate, and any NSSF wage ceiling). A licensed Tanzanian tax practitioner / accountant must reconcile those before any output is presented as final.

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (PAYE — Pay-As-You-Earn)

Tanzania **does** levy personal income tax on employees. The employer is the **withholding agent**: it deducts PAYE monthly from payroll and remits it to TRA by the **7th of the following month** using form **ITX 300.01.E** (TRA — SDL/PAYE). The brackets below are expressed on **MONTHLY taxable employment income in TZS**.

### PAYE Progressive Table — Monthly Taxable Income (resident, CONFIRMED)

**PAYE Progressive Table — Monthly Taxable Income (resident, CONFIRMED)**  _(TRA — Income tax for individuals (`tra.go.tz/page/income-tax-for-individuals`); PwC — Taxes on personal income)_

| Monthly taxable income (TZS) | Marginal rate | Tax (cumulative at top of band) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 – 270,000 | **NIL** | TZS 0 |
| 270,001 – 520,000 | **8%** of excess over 270,000 | TZS 20,000 |
| 520,001 – 760,000 | **20%** of excess over 520,000 | 20,000 + 48,000 = TZS 68,000 |
| 760,001 – 1,000,000 | **25%** of excess over 760,000 | 68,000 + 60,000 = TZS 128,000 |
| Over 1,000,000 | **30%** of excess over 1,000,000 | — |

Note: the lowest taxed band is **8%** (a secondary calculator source that stated 9% is incorrect; TRA and PwC both confirm 8%).

- **Annual tax-free threshold** — TZS 3,240,000 (= 270,000 × 12)  _(TRA)_
- **Top marginal rate** — 30%  _(TRA; PwC)_
- **Zanzibar PAYE rates** — Zanzibar PAYE rates are identical to Mainland  _(PwC)_

**Subtract-method constants (resident)**

| Band (TZS) | Rate | Subtract (TZS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 270,001 – 520,000 | 8% | 21,600 |
| 520,001 – 760,000 | 20% | 84,000 |
| 760,001 – 1,000,000 | 25% | 122,000 |
| 1,000,001+ | 30% | 172,000 |

*Continuity check (subtract constants tie out to the cumulative column):*
- At 520,000 → 0.08 × 520,000 − 21,600 = 41,600 − 21,600 = **TZS 20,000**. Tie out.
- At 760,000 → 0.20 × 760,000 − 84,000 = 152,000 − 84,000 = **TZS 68,000**. Tie out.
- At 1,000,000 → 0.25 × 1,000,000 − 122,000 = 250,000 − 122,000 = **TZS 128,000**. Tie out.
- Band entry 1,000,001 → 0.30 × 1,000,001 − 172,000 = **TZS 128,000.30** ≈ continuous with 128,000. Tie out.

### Non-resident employment income

**Non-resident employment income table**

| Item | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Non-resident PAYE | Flat **15%** on Tanzania-source employment income | PwC — Taxes on personal income |
| Nature | **Final tax** — no further individual return required | PwC |

### Withholding mechanism

- PAYE is **withheld monthly by the employer** from payroll and remitted to TRA by the **7th** of the following month on form **ITX 300.01.E** via the TRA online portal (TRA — SDL/PAYE).
- Annual: final individual return due within **6 months of year-end**; a statement of estimated tax is due within **3 months of the start of the year of income** (relevant for individuals with non-employment income) (PwC — Tax administration).

## Section 3 -- NSSF Social Security (Private Sector — Employee + Employer)

Private-sector employees contribute to the **National Social Security Fund (NSSF)**. The employer deducts, schedules and pays both the employer and employee shares (NSSF — Rate of contributions).

### NSSF Contribution (basis: gross monthly salary)

**NSSF Contribution (basis: gross monthly salary)**  _(NSSF — Rate of contributions; PwC — Other taxes)_

| Item | Total | Employer | Employee | Basis | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NSSF | **20%** | **10%** (≥ 10%) | **10%** (≤ 10%) | Gross monthly salary | NSSF — Rate of contributions; PwC — Other taxes |

- **Total contribution basis** — Total contribution is 20% of the employee's gross monthly salary, a joint employer/employee contribution  _(NSSF)_
- **Employee share cap and splits** — The employee's share must not exceed 10%; the employer covers at least 10%. The common arrangement is 10% / 10%. The employer may also pay the full 20%, or other splits (e.g. 15% employer / 5% employee) are permitted provided the employee share ≤ 10%  _(NSSF)_
- **No statutory wage ceiling/floor** — No statutory wage ceiling/floor is stated on the NSSF rate page — the contribution is a straight percentage of gross salary. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm absence of an NSSF contribution ceiling with NSSF]
- **Filing form** — NSSF/CON.5 (schedule of contributing employees)  _(NSSF)_
- **NSSF deadline** — Remit within one month from the month of salary payment (i.e. by the end of the following month)  _(NSSF)_

*Column check (default split):* employer 10% + employee 10% = **20%** total. Tie out.

### PSSSF (Public Sector)

**PSSSF (Public Sector) table**  _(PwC — Other taxes)_

| Item | Total | Employer (typical) | Employee (typical) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PSSSF | **20%** | 15% | 5% | PwC — Other taxes |

- **PSSSF applicability** — The Public Service Social Security Fund (PSSSF) applies to public-sector employees, not the typical private employer. Same total 20%; the employer recovers up to 5% from the employee (i.e. employee 5% / employer 15% typical)  _(PwC)_

*Column check:* employer 15% + employee 5% = **20%** total. Tie out.

## Section 4 -- SDL — Skills Development Levy (Employer-only)

**SDL table**  _(TRA — Skills Development Levy; PwC — Other taxes)_

| Item | Rate | Who pays | Basis | Threshold | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDL | **3.5%** | Employer only | Total gross cash emoluments for the month | Employers with **≥ 10 employees** | TRA — Skills Development Levy; PwC — Other taxes |

- **SDL basis clarification** — 3.5% of total gross cash emoluments paid to all employees in the month. (The authoritative TRA figure is 3.5%; some secondary sources stated 4% — TRA and PwC both confirm 3.5%.)  _(TRA)_
- **SDL headcount threshold** — Only employers with 10 or more employees are liable for SDL  _(TRA)_
- **SDL collection and form** — Collected by TRA; same payment form ITX 300.01.E  _(TRA)_
- **SDL deadline** — 7th day of the month following the payroll month (same as PAYE)  _(TRA)_

## Section 5 -- WCF — Workers Compensation Fund (Employer-only)

**WCF table**  _(WCF (`wcf.go.tz`); PwC — Other taxes)_

| Item | Rate | Who pays | Basis | Sector | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| WCF | **0.5%** | Employer only | Monthly wage bill (gross employee earnings) | Private **and** public | WCF (`wcf.go.tz`); PwC — Other taxes |

- **WCF rate harmonisation** — 0.5% of the employer's monthly wage bill — the same rate now applies to both private and public sector (the previously differentiated 1% private / 0.5% public rates have been harmonised to 0.5%)  _(WCF)_
- **WCF filing** — Filed/paid online at www.wcf.go.tz  _(WCF)_
- **WCF deadline** — Monthly, payable within the month or the following month (e.g. July contributions by 31 August). Quarterly/semi-annual/annual schedules are possible with Director-General approval  _(WCF)_

## Section 6 -- Combined Employer / Employee Payroll Burden

For a **private employer with ≥ 10 employees** (so SDL applies), on a resident employee using the default NSSF 10%/10% split:

**Combined Employer / Employee Payroll Burden table**

| Item | Employee | Employer | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PAYE | 0–30% progressive (withheld) | (withholding agent) | monthly taxable income |
| NSSF | 10% | 10% | gross |
| SDL | — | 3.5% | total gross emoluments (≥ 10 staff) |
| WCF | — | 0.5% | gross wage bill |

- **Employer on-cost above gross salary** — 10% (NSSF) + 3.5% (SDL) + 0.5% (WCF) = 14% of gross for employers with ≥ 10 staff
- **Fewer than 10 employees on-cost** — If the employer has fewer than 10 employees, SDL does not apply. The employer on-cost is then NSSF 10% + WCF 0.5% = 10.5% of gross. PAYE and NSSF still apply in full.

## Section 7 -- Minimum Wage (Private Sector)

Tanzania has **no single national minimum wage** — minimum wages are **sectoral**.

**Minimum wage instrument/structure table**  _(TanzLII (GN 605A/2025); PKF; VELMA Law)_

| Item | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current order | **Labour Institutions (Minimum Wage for Private Sector) Order, 2025 (GN 605A/2025)**, in force **from 1 January 2026**; replaces the 2022 order | TanzLII (GN 605A/2025); PKF; VELMA Law |
| Structure | **16 sectors / 46 sub-sectors** regulated; average increase 33.4% vs the 2022 order | PKF; VELMA Law |

### Representative sectoral minimum wages (TZS/month)

**Representative sectoral minimum wages (TZS/month)**  _(PKF; VELMA Law)_

| Sector (example) | Monthly minimum (TZS) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Default / unspecified sectors | 175,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| Agriculture (crop / animal) | 175,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| Domestic workers | 80,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| Fishing / aquaculture | 300,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| 4-/5-star hotels | 375,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| Telecommunications | 644,000 | PKF; VELMA Law |
| International mining / energy | up to ~765,900 | PKF; VELMA Law |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The full **46-sub-sector** schedule could not be extracted from a single authoritative source. The figures above are **representative**; the complete schedule must be pulled from the **TanzLII gazette (GN 605A/2025)** before being treated as final. Always use the employee's specific sub-sector rate.

## Section 8 -- Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults table**

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Residency status | Assume **resident** (progressive table) only if confirmed; if status unknown, FLAG | Non-resident is flat 15% final — materially different |
| NSSF split | Use **10% employee / 10% employer** | Default; employee share capped at 10% |
| Headcount unknown (for SDL) | Compute **without** SDL but FLAG; never silently apply 3.5% | SDL applies only at ≥ 10 employees |
| Headcount ≥ 10 confirmed | Apply **SDL 3.5%** (employer) | Statutory once threshold met |
| Public vs private sector | Default **private** (NSSF + SDL + WCF); switch to PSSSF if public | PSSSF only for public-sector staff |
| NSSF wage ceiling | Apply 20% on **full gross** (no cap) and FLAG | No ceiling found on the NSSF rate page |
| Tax year | Default to **2026** brackets/rates | Skill tax_year is 2026 |
| Currency | Tanzanian Shilling (TZS) | Local currency |
| Minimum-wage sub-sector unknown | Do NOT pick a figure — request the sub-sector and use GN 605A/2025 | Sectoral; no national floor |

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative** assumption (the one that does NOT understate withholding/contributions) and FLAG it for the reviewer.

### Required inputs before computing payroll

1. Gross monthly salary in TZS (and any non-cash/benefit components).
2. **Residency status** (resident → progressive; non-resident → flat 15% final).
3. Sector / sub-sector (drives the minimum-wage check under GN 605A/2025).
4. **Number of employees** on the payroll (drives SDL liability at ≥ 10).
5. Whether the employer is **private (NSSF)** or **public (PSSSF)**.
6. NSSF split if non-standard (employer may pay full 20%; employee share ≤ 10%).
7. Tax/fiscal year (2026 vs later schedules).
8. Pay frequency.

### Refusal catalogue — DO NOT compute, refuse and request input

**Refusal catalogue table**

| Situation | Action |
| --- | --- |
| No gross salary provided | REFUSE — request salary in TZS |
| Residency status unknown | REFUSE — resident vs non-resident changes PAYE entirely (progressive vs flat 15%) |
| Request to omit PAYE, NSSF, SDL or WCF to "save money" | REFUSE — statutory; escalate to accountant |
| Request to apply SDL where headcount is < 10 | REFUSE — SDL only applies at ≥ 10 employees |
| Request to apply SDL at 4% | REFUSE — TRA-confirmed rate is 3.5% |
| Request to set an exact minimum-wage figure without the sub-sector | REFUSE — sectoral; request sub-sector and use GN 605A/2025 |
| Self-employed / non-employment income mixed in | REFUSE payroll path — route to a Tanzania income-tax skill (annual return) |
| Definitive "this is your exact tax" assertion requested | REFUSE — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |

## Section 10 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Classify bank-statement lines deterministically. Match case-insensitively; longest/most-specific pattern wins. Tanzanian statements appear in **English and Kiswahili**.

### Salary credits (money arriving in an employee account)

**Salary credits table**

| Pattern (case-insensitive) | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `SALARY`, `MSHAHARA`, `MISHAHARA`, `PAYROLL`, `NET PAY` | Net salary payment |
| `MALIPO YA MSHAHARA`, `WAGE`, `TRANSF.* [employer]` | Net salary payment |
| `NSSF REFUND`, `MAREJESHO NSSF` | NSSF refund/adjustment — not income |
| `TRA REFUND`, `PAYE REFUND` | PAYE refund/adjustment — not income |

### Employer debits (money leaving the employer account)

**Employer debits table**

| Pattern | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| `TRA`, `PAYE`, `ITX 300`, `KODI`, `WITHHOLDING TAX` | PAYE withholding remitted to TRA (ITX 300.01.E) |
| `SDL`, `SKILLS DEVELOPMENT LEVY`, `TOZO YA UJUZI` | Skills Development Levy remitted to TRA (3.5%, ≥ 10 staff) |
| `NSSF`, `MICHANGO NSSF`, `CON.5`, `PENSION` | NSSF contribution (employer + employee shares) |
| `PSSSF` | PSSSF contribution (public-sector) |
| `WCF`, `FIDIA YA WAFANYAKAZI`, `WORKERS COMPENSATION` | Workers Compensation Fund (0.5%, employer-only) |
| `NET WAGES`, `MALIPO YA MISHAHARA`, `SALARY RUN`, `DISBURSEMENT` | Net wages disbursed to employees |

## Section 11 -- Worked Examples

> All figures use the **2026** resident PAYE table and 2026 contribution rates. Default NSSF split is 10% employee / 10% employer. SDL (3.5%) is shown only where the employer has ≥ 10 staff. WCF (0.5%) and SDL are employer-only and do **not** reduce employee net pay. Amounts rounded to the shilling.

### Example 1 — Low earner below the PAYE threshold

**Inputs:** Gross salary TZS 250,000/month. Resident. NSSF 10%/10%.

- PAYE: 250,000 ≤ 270,000 → **TZS 0**.
- NSSF employee 10% × 250,000 = **TZS 25,000**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 0 + 25,000 = **TZS 25,000**.
- **Net pay** = 250,000 − 25,000 = **TZS 225,000**.

*Bank line example:* `MSHAHARA — JANUARY` credit **TZS 225,000**.

### Example 2 — Earner in the 8% PAYE band

**Inputs:** Gross salary TZS 400,000/month. Resident. NSSF 10%/10%.

- PAYE: 400,000 in 8% band → 0.08 × 400,000 − 21,600 = 32,000 − 21,600 = **TZS 10,400**.
  - Verify by band: 0.08 × (400,000 − 270,000) = 0.08 × 130,000 = **10,400**. Tie out.
- NSSF employee 10% × 400,000 = **TZS 40,000**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 10,400 + 40,000 = **TZS 50,400**.
- **Net pay** = 400,000 − 50,400 = **TZS 349,600**.

### Example 3 — Mid earner in the 20% PAYE band

**Inputs:** Gross salary TZS 700,000/month. Resident. NSSF 10%/10%.

- PAYE: 700,000 in 20% band → 0.20 × 700,000 − 84,000 = 140,000 − 84,000 = **TZS 56,000**.
  - Verify by bands: 20,000 (up to 520k) + 0.20 × (700,000 − 520,000) = 20,000 + 36,000 = **56,000**. Tie out.
- NSSF employee 10% × 700,000 = **TZS 70,000**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 56,000 + 70,000 = **TZS 126,000**.
- **Net pay** = 700,000 − 126,000 = **TZS 574,000**.

### Example 4 — Higher earner in the 30% PAYE band

**Inputs:** Gross salary TZS 1,500,000/month. Resident. NSSF 10%/10%.

- PAYE: 1,500,000 in 30% band → 0.30 × 1,500,000 − 172,000 = 450,000 − 172,000 = **TZS 278,000**.
  - Verify by bands: 128,000 (up to 1,000k) + 0.30 × (1,500,000 − 1,000,000) = 128,000 + 150,000 = **278,000**. Tie out.
- NSSF employee 10% × 1,500,000 = **TZS 150,000**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 278,000 + 150,000 = **TZS 428,000**.
- **Net pay** = 1,500,000 − 428,000 = **TZS 1,072,000**.

### Example 5 — Employer total cost of the mid earner (TZS 700,000, ≥ 10 staff)

Building on Example 3 (gross TZS 700,000), private employer with ≥ 10 employees:

**Employer cost table**

| Employer cost item | Computation | Amount (TZS) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gross salary | — | 700,000 |
| NSSF employer 10% | 10% × 700,000 | 70,000 |
| SDL 3.5% | 3.5% × 700,000 | 24,500 |
| WCF 0.5% | 0.5% × 700,000 | 3,500 |
| **Total employer cost** | sum | **798,000** |

*Check:* 700,000 + 70,000 + 24,500 + 3,500 = **798,000**. Tie out.
(Employer-on-top burden = TZS 98,000 = **14%** of gross.)

### Example 6 — Non-resident employee (flat 15% final)

**Inputs:** Non-resident, Tanzania-source employment income TZS 700,000/month.

- PAYE = flat **15% × 700,000 = TZS 105,000** (final tax; no further return).
- Net of PAYE = 700,000 − 105,000 = **TZS 595,000**.

> NSSF may still apply to a non-resident working in Tanzania depending on the engagement; the **15% PAYE is a final income-tax**, separate from any social-security liability. Confirm NSSF applicability for the specific contract with the reviewer.

## Section 12 -- Tier 1 Rules (hard, non-negotiable)

- **Rule 1** — PAYE is employer-withheld monthly and remitted to TRA by the 7th of the following month on ITX 300.01.E; never skip it for salaried staff  _(TRA)_
- **Rule 2** — Use the monthly resident taxable-income table and apply the subtract-method constants exactly (21,600 / 84,000 / 122,000 / 172,000). The lowest taxed band is 8%, not 9%.
- **Rule 3** — Non-residents pay a flat 15% final tax on Tanzania-source employment income — never apply the progressive table to a confirmed non-resident  _(PwC)_
- **Rule 4** — NSSF is 20% total (default 10%/10%); the employee share must not exceed 10%  _(NSSF)_
- **Rule 5** — SDL (3.5%) is employer-only and applies only at ≥ 10 employees; the rate is 3.5%, not 4%  _(TRA)_
- **Rule 6** — WCF (0.5%) is employer-only and applies to both private and public sector  _(WCF)_
- **Rule 7** — PAYE + SDL share the 7th-of-next-month deadline; NSSF and WCF are due within the following month  _(TRA; NSSF; WCF)_
- **Rule 8** — Minimum wage is sectoral under GN 605A/2025 (in force 1 Jan 2026) — there is no national floor; use the employee's sub-sector rate
- **Rule 9** — Every output is an estimate pending licensed-accountant sign-off

## Section 13 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

**Tier 2 Catalogue table**

| Question | Why it needs a reviewer |
| --- | --- |
| Full 46-sub-sector minimum-wage schedule (GN 605A/2025) | Only representative figures extracted; full list needs the gazette text |
| Existence of an NSSF contribution ceiling | None found on the NSSF rate page; confirm explicitly with NSSF |
| Late-payment interest rate | Floats with the Bank of Tanzania discount rate (compounded); no fixed % published |
| Non-resident NSSF liability | Depends on the specific contract / secondment arrangement |
| Non-standard NSSF splits (e.g. 15%/5%, employer pays full 20%) | Permitted provided employee share ≤ 10%; depends on employer policy |
| Treatment of benefits in kind / allowances in the PAYE and NSSF base | Edge cases not fully nailed from primary sources |

## Section 14 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested layout (one row per employee per month):

**Excel Working Paper Template table**

| Col | Header | Formula / source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A | Employee name | input |
| B | Gross monthly salary (TZS) | input |
| C | Resident? (Y/N) | input |
| D | Headcount ≥ 10? (Y/N) | input (drives SDL) |
| E | PAYE (monthly) | resident: nested IF on B (subtract constants); non-resident: `=B*15%` |
| F | NSSF employee | `=B*10%` |
| G | Employee deductions | `=E+F` |

| K | WCF (employer) | `=B*0.5%` |
| L | Total employer cost | `=B+I+J+K` |

- **Resident PAYE formula for column E (2026, monthly)** — =IF(B<=270000,0, IF(B<=520000, B*0.08-21600, IF(B<=760000, B*0.20-84000, IF(B<=1000000, B*0.25-122000, B*0.30-172000))))
- **Non-resident PAYE formula** — =B*0.15 (flat, final)

| Mkazi / Asiye mkazi | Resident / non-resident (15% flat final PAYE) |

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data:

1. **No prior payroll register available** → request the last 3 months of payroll and TRA/NSSF/WCF receipts to back-solve the rates actually applied.
2. **Unknown residency** → do not compute PAYE; confirm resident vs non-resident first (progressive vs flat 15% final).
3. **Unknown headcount** → default SDL OFF, FLAG; confirm before the first remittance (SDL at ≥ 10).
4. **Unknown sector** → do not assert a minimum wage; request the sub-sector and check GN 605A/2025.
5. **Year ambiguity** → default 2026 table/rates; switch only for periods in a later year of income.
6. **Public vs private** → confirm; PSSSF (public) vs NSSF (private) change the contribution path.

## Section 20 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputes end-to-end. Expected values use the 2026 resident PAYE table and 2026 rates
(NSSF 10%/10%).

- **Test 1 - Sub-threshold earner** — Gross TZS 250,000/mo, resident. Expected: PAYE = TZS 0; NSSF employee TZS 25,000; net TZS 225,000.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 2 - 8% band** — Gross TZS 400,000/mo, resident. PAYE TZS 10,400; NSSF employee TZS 40,000; net TZS 349,600.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 3 - 20% band** — Gross TZS 700,000/mo, resident. PAYE TZS 56,000; NSSF employee TZS 70,000; net TZS 574,000.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 4 - 30% band** — Gross TZS 1,500,000/mo, resident. PAYE TZS 278,000; NSSF employee TZS 150,000; net TZS 1,072,000.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 5 - Employer cost** — Gross TZS 700,000/mo, ≥ 10 staff. NSSF employer TZS 70,000; SDL TZS 24,500; WCF TZS 3,500; total employer cost TZS 798,000 (burden 14% of gross).  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 6 - Non-resident** — TZS 700,000/mo Tanzania-source. PAYE = TZS 105,000 (15% flat, final); net of PAYE TZS 595,000.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 7 - Bracket continuity** — At monthly 520,000 → PAYE TZS 20,000; at 760,000 → PAYE TZS 68,000; at 1,000,000 → PAYE TZS 128,000 (subtract constants 21,600 / 84,000 / 122,000 / 172,000 tie out).  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 8 - SDL threshold guard** — An employer with 9 employees computing SDL is WRONG — SDL applies only at ≥ 10. With ≥ 10 it is 3.5%, never 4%.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 9 - Rate guard** — Applying 9% as the lowest taxed band is WRONG — the lowest taxed band is 8%.  _(Section 20 -- Test Suite)_
- **Test 10 - Minimum-wage refusal** — Asserting a single national minimum wage → REFUSE; minimum wage is sectoral (GN 605A/2025) — request the sub-sector.  _(GN 605A/2025)_

## PROHIBITIONS

- **PAYE withholding obligation** — NEVER skip PAYE withholding for salaried employees — the employer is the legal withholding agent.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Lowest band rate guard** — NEVER apply the 9% lowest band — the TRA-confirmed lowest taxed band is 8%.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Non-resident flat rate rule** — NEVER apply the resident progressive table to a confirmed non-resident — they pay a flat 15% final.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **SDL applicability and rate** — NEVER apply SDL where the employer has fewer than 10 employees, and NEVER use 4% — SDL is 3.5%.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **NSSF employee share cap** — NEVER let the employee NSSF share exceed 10% — the employee share is capped at 10% (total 20%).  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **WCF/SDL employer-only** — NEVER treat WCF or SDL as employee deductions — both are employer-only.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **NSSF wage ceiling assumption** — NEVER assume an NSSF wage ceiling without confirming one exists — none was found in the sources.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Minimum wage sectoral rule** — NEVER assert a single national minimum wage — it is sectoral under GN 605A/2025; use the sub-sector rate.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Late-payment interest floating rate** — NEVER quote a fixed late-payment interest percentage — it floats with the Bank of Tanzania discount rate.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Estimated computation disclaimer requirement** — NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Tanzanian accountant.  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
