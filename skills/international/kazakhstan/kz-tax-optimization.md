# Kazakhstan Tax Optimization (Self-Employed) — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Scope | LEGAL tax planning only |
| Currency | KZT; MRP (МРП) ₸4,325, min wage ₸85,000 for 2026 (verify) |
| Main levers | Regime choice · VAT threshold · Astana Hub (IT) · contribution minimums |
| Tax authority | State Revenue Committee (КГД) |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

> **2026 Tax Code context:** the patent and retail-tax special regimes were abolished and the special-regime menu cut to three; the simplified declaration is now a single **4%** rate (maslikhat-adjustable 2–6%). VAT rate and registration threshold changed — verify the current figures.

## Section 2 — Choosing the regime (Tier 1)

| Regime | Tax | Best when |
|---|---|---|
| Simplified declaration (Форма 910) | 4% of turnover (no expense deduction) | Service/low-cost businesses under the turnover ceiling |
| General regime | ИПН 10% on **net profit** | High documented expenses (low margin), or over the simplified ceiling |
| Astana Hub (IT) | Major relief on qualifying IT income | Software/IT activity that qualifies for accreditation |

**Break-even logic:** simplified (4% of turnover) beats general (10% of profit) whenever your net margin is **above 40%** (4% of turnover = 10% of profit at a 40% margin). Below ~40% margin with documented costs, the general regime is usually cheaper.

## Section 3 — The VAT threshold lever
Staying below the VAT registration threshold avoids charging VAT and the compliance burden. The 2026 Tax Code **lowered** the threshold (verify), so more small businesses now cross it — plan turnover timing and watch the rolling test. Once over, registration is mandatory.

## Section 4 — Astana Hub (IT)
For software/IT freelancers, **Astana Hub** accreditation can deliver the single biggest legal saving (historically CIT/IIT, VAT and payroll social-tax relief on qualifying IT income). Verify current eligibility and relief.

## Section 5 — Worked personas
- **Designer, ₸15m turnover, 80% margin:** simplified 4% = ₸600,000. General 10% on ₸12m profit = ₸1.2m. **Simplified wins.**
- **Reseller, ₸40m turnover, 15% margin:** simplified 4% = ₸1.6m. General 10% on ₸6m profit = ₸600,000. **General wins** (and watch the VAT threshold).
- **IT contractor:** check **Astana Hub** first — can beat both.

## Section 6 — Risks & red flags
- **Disguised employment:** a company replacing employees with ИП contractors to cut social/payroll tax is an anti-avoidance target — flag, don't advise.
- **Artificial splitting** of turnover across multiple ИП to stay under thresholds is an evasion scheme — prohibited.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER advise disguised employment or turnover-splitting to dodge thresholds.
- NEVER claim Astana Hub relief without confirming accreditation + current rules.
- NEVER state VAT threshold / rates without verifying the 2026 Tax Code.
