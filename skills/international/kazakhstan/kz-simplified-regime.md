# Kazakhstan Special Tax Regimes for Small Business (СНР) — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill computes and explains **Kazakhstan special tax regimes** (Russian: *специальные налоговые
режимы*, **СНР**; Kazakh: *арнайы салық режимдері*) for **individual entrepreneurs** (Russian
*индивидуальный предприниматель*, **ИП**; Kazakh *жеке кәсіпкер*, **ЖК**) and very small businesses —
the **simplified declaration regime** (*упрощённая декларация*, **Форма 910.00**) and the new
**self-employed regime** (*режим для самозанятых*). The prose is in English; native Russian and
Kazakh terms are kept inline because the source forms, the State Revenue Committee portal, the
**E-Salyq Business** app, and bank statements use them. **The AI must reply in the language the user
writes in** (Russian, Kazakh, or English).

> **The headline 2026 change.** A NEW Tax Code (signed 18 Jul 2025, effective **1 January 2026**)
> cut the number of special tax regimes from **seven to three**. The **patent regime (патент)**, the
> **retail tax (розничный налог, ст. 696-1)** and the **fixed-deduction regime (фиксированный
> вычет)** were **ABOLISHED**. What survives for the self-employed: (1) the **simplified declaration**
> and (2) the **self-employed regime** (plus the peasant/farm-household regime, out of scope here).
> Do not advise a client to "go on patent" or "use retail tax" for 2026 — those routes are gone.

> **Scope guard.** Special-regime taxpayers from 2026 **cannot be VAT payers** (except import VAT and
> reverse-charge VAT on non-residents). If business income is taxed on the **general established
> regime (ОУР)**, route to **kz-income-tax** (Форма 220.00). For НДС route to **kazakhstan-vat**; for
> ОПВ/ОПВР/СО/ВОСМС route to **kz-social-contributions**.

## 1. Quick Reference

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Topic | Special tax regimes for small business / ИП — СНР / арнайы салық режимдері |
| Authority | State Revenue Committee — **Комитет государственных доходов (КГД)**, under the Ministry of Finance; portal **kgd.gov.kz**, filing via **cabinet.salyk.kz** / eGov / **E-Salyq Business** app |
| Currency | Kazakhstani tenge — **KZT (₸)** |
| Legislation | **Tax Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2026)** — Code No. 214-VIII of 18 Jul 2025, effective **1 January 2026** |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec 2026); simplified declaration period = **half-year (полугодие)** |
| Simplified return | **Форма 910.00** + appendix **910.01** (redesigned for 2026) |
| Surviving SNR (2026) | (1) Simplified declaration, (2) Self-employed regime, (3) Peasant/farm (КХ — out of scope) |
| ABOLISHED from 2026 | **Patent (патент)**, **retail tax (розничный налог, ст. 696-1)**, **fixed-deduction (фиксированный вычет)** |
| MCI / МРП (2026) | **4,325 ₸** (месячный расчётный показатель) *(verify on 1 Jan 2026 budget law)* |

| Regime-choice deadline | Notification (уведомление) by **1 March 2026**; no notice → auto-moved to ОУР |
| Quality tier | **Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant** |
| Skill version | **1.0** |

### Conservative defaults

When information is missing or ambiguous, the AI applies the **safer** assumption and flags it:

- **Default rate for the simplified declaration = 4%** (the national base rate). Only apply a reduced
  rate (e.g. 2% or 3%) if the user confirms the **maslikhat** (местный представительный орган) of
  their specific district/city set one for their activity. Rates can be adjusted **±50% → 2%–6%**.
- **Assume the client is NOT on patent or retail tax for 2026** — those regimes no longer exist.
  If a client says they were "on patent," explain they were auto-migrated and must re-choose.
- **Assume turnover is measured against the annual ceiling in МРП**, converted at the МРП value in
  force **on 1 January of the year** (4,325 ₸ for 2026), not a current-month МРП.
- **Assume special-regime ИП are NOT VAT payers**; flag if turnover approaches the VAT-registration
  threshold (handled in kazakhstan-vat) — crossing it can force a move to ОУР.
- Where a figure cannot be confirmed against the 2026 Code → give the **formula** + the note
  **"verify under 2026 Tax Code"**. Never invent a maslikhat rate or a precise ceiling in ₸.

## 2. The regimes compared

| Feature | **Self-employed** (самозанятые) | **Simplified declaration** (упрощённая декларация) | **General regime** (ОУР) *(reference)* |
|---|---|---|---|
| Form / app | **E-Salyq Business** app (no paper return) | **Форма 910.00** (+ 910.01) | Форма 220.00 (ИП) |
| Filing frequency | Monthly self-assessment in app *(verify)* | **Half-year (semi-annual)** | Annual |
| Turnover ceiling | **300 МРП / month** (≈ **3,600 МРП / year**) | **600,000 МРП / year** | No SNR ceiling |
| Ceiling in ₸ (2026) | ≈ **1,297,500 ₸/month** (300 × 4,325) | ≈ **2,595,000,000 ₸/year** (600,000 × 4,325) | — |
| Employees | **None allowed** | **No statutory limit** (was capped under old code) *(verify)* | Unlimited |
| Tax base | Gross income | Gross turnover (доход) | Income **minus** deductions |
| Headline rate | **0% ИПН + 4% social payments** | **4%** combined (ИПН/КПН), maslikhat ±50% → 2%–6% | 10% / 15% progressive |
| Social tax (СН) | Included in the 4% bundle | **Not separately paid** by ИП on simplified (2026 change) | Paid separately |
| VAT (НДС) | No | No (except import / non-resident reverse charge) | Yes if registered |
| Activities | Restricted to a **government-approved list** | Broad, but **prohibited list** applies (see §3) | Almost all |
| Replaces | **Patent + mobile-app regime** (abolished) | Absorbed the old **retail tax** features | — |

> **Big picture.** The 2026 code pushed the old **patent** crowd down into the **self-employed**
> regime and pulled the old **retail tax** crowd up into the **simplified declaration**. There is no
> longer a "patent" or "retail tax" middle tier.

## 3. Eligibility & ceilings

### 3.1 Simplified declaration (упрощённая декларация)

A resident **ИП** or **ТОО** (LLP) may apply the simplified declaration if **all** hold:

- **Annual income ≤ 600,000 МРП** (≈ 2,595,000,000 ₸ for 2026). Exceeding it mid-year forces a
  switch to ОУР from the start of the next quarter/period *(verify transition timing under 2026
  Code)*.
- The activity is **not on the prohibited list**. Commonly excluded: production/sale of
  **excisable goods** (подакцизные товары — alcohol, tobacco, fuel), **lotteries/gambling**,
  certain **financial / subsoil / consultancy / accounting / legal** activities, and grain
  receipts/storage *(confirm the exact 2026 list before relying on it)*.
- The taxpayer is **not a VAT payer** under the special regime (import/non-resident VAT excepted).
- Employee headcount: the old code capped staff (e.g. ~30 for ИП); the **2026 code reportedly
  removed the explicit headcount cap** for the simplified declaration *(verify under 2026 Code)*.

### 3.2 Self-employed regime (самозанятые)

A natural person may use the self-employed regime if **all** hold:

- **Monthly income ≤ 300 МРП** (≈ 1,297,500 ₸ for 2026; ≈ 3,600 МРП per year).
- The activity is on the **government-approved list** of permitted self-employed activities
  *(verify the 2026 list — typically personal services, crafts, tutoring, small trade, etc.)*.
- **No hired employees** (труд работников не используется).
- Cannot simultaneously be a registered ИП for the same activity *(verify)*.
- Tax and social payments are self-assessed through the **E-Salyq Business** mobile app.

> This regime **replaced the patent (патент)** and the "**mobile transfers / E-Salyq**" special
> arrangement. Former patent holders were **auto-migrated to self-employed on 1 Jan 2026**; they
> may de-register or actively choose a different regime instead.

### 3.3 Choosing / switching — the 1 March 2026 trap

To apply a special regime, file a **notification (уведомление о применяемом режиме)** via
cabinet.salyk.kz, E-Salyq Business, a bank app (e.g. Kaspi), or a КГД office. **Deadline:
1 March 2026.** A taxpayer who files no notification is **automatically placed on the general
regime (ОУР)** for the year. Newly registered ИП elect their regime at registration.

---

## 4. Rates & computation (with the 2026 changes)

### 4.1 Simplified declaration — the core formula

Historically (pre-2026) the simplified rate was **3% of turnover**, conceptually split into **~1.5%
individual income tax (ИПН) + ~1.5% social tax (СН)**, declared on the half-year Форма 910.00.

**From 2026 this changed.** The rate is a **single combined 4% of turnover (доход)**, treated as
**ИПН (for ИП) / КПН (for ТОО)**. Critically:

- **Social tax (СН) is no longer paid separately** by ИП on the simplified declaration — it is
  folded into / replaced by the single rate. *(Verify the exact ИПН-vs-СН labelling on the 2026
  Форма 910.00.)*
- **Maslikhats (местные представительные органы)** may move the rate **±50%**, i.e. anywhere from
  **2% to 6%**, by activity and region. Many districts set **2% or 3%** for 2026. Always confirm the
  local rate before computing.

```
Simplified tax = Turnover (полугодовой доход) × applicable rate
applicable rate = 4%  (default)  OR  the maslikhat rate (2%–6%) if confirmed
```

**Separate from the tax above**, the ИП still owes its **own** social/pension payments
(ОПВ, ОПВР, СО, ВОСМС) on its declared income, and — **if it has employees** — payroll obligations
(ИПН, ОПВ, ОПВР, СО, ОСМС, ВОСМС) on wages. Note that simplified-regime employers are reported as
**exempt from social tax on employees** under the 2026 design *(verify)*. For all contribution rates
and bases use **kz-social-contributions**.

### 4.2 Self-employed — the core formula

```
Self-employed payment = Income × 4%   (this 4% is SOCIAL PAYMENTS only)
ИПН = 0%
```

The **4% is a bundle of social payments only** (commonly described as ОПВ / ОПВР / СО / ВОСМС at
~1% each → 4% total) with **ИПН at 0%**. *(Verify the exact split of the 4% under the 2026 Code.)*

### 4.3 What the 2026 Tax Code changed — summary

| Item | Pre-2026 | 2026 Tax Code |
|---|---|---|
| Number of SNR | **7** | **3** (simplified, self-employed, peasant/farm) |
| Patent (патент) | Available | **ABOLISHED** → holders auto-moved to self-employed |
| Retail tax (розничный налог, ст. 696-1) | 4% (some activities) | **ABOLISHED** → features merged into simplified |
| Fixed-deduction regime | Available | **ABOLISHED** |
| Simplified rate | ~3% (≈1.5% ИПН + ≈1.5% СН) | **4% combined**, СН not separate; maslikhat **±50% → 2%–6%** |
| Simplified turnover ceiling | ~24,038 МРП per half-year *(old)* | **600,000 МРП per year** |
| Simplified employee cap | ~30 *(ИП)* | Reportedly **removed** *(verify)* |
| Self-employed ceiling | n/a (patent-based) | **300 МРП/month (≈3,600 МРП/year)**, 0% ИПН + 4% social |
| Special-regime VAT | possible in some cases | **Not VAT payers** (import/non-resident excepted) |

## 5. Filing & payment calendar (2026)

| Obligation | Period | File by | Pay by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Notification of regime** (уведомление) | Year 2026 | **1 Mar 2026** | — |
| **Форма 910.00 — 1st half-year** (Jan–Jun) | H1 2026 | **15 Aug 2026** | **25 Aug 2026** |
| **Форма 910.00 — 2nd half-year** (Jul–Dec) | H2 2026 | **15 Feb 2027** | **25 Feb 2027** |
| **Self-employed** payments (E-Salyq Business) | Monthly | in-app | by the **25th** of the next month *(verify)* |
| **ОПВ/ОПВР/СО/ВОСМС** (own + payroll) | Monthly | — | by the **25th** of the next month |
| **Форма 200.00** (if employees / withholding) | Quarterly | 15th of 2nd month after quarter *(verify)* | 25th |

> The simplified declaration is filed **twice a year (полугодие)** on Форма 910.00; payroll/
> withholding (Форма 200.00) stays **quarterly**. Always re-confirm the exact 2026 due dates on
> cabinet.salyk.kz — half-year deadlines that fall on a weekend roll to the next business day.

## 6. Worked examples

> Figures use **МРП 2026 = 4,325 ₸**. Verify the МРП value and any maslikhat rate before relying on
> a result. All examples assume the activity is permitted and turnover stays within ceiling.

### Example 1 — Simplified declaration, default 4%, no employees

Aigerim is an ИП (web design) on the simplified declaration. H1 2026 turnover = **9,000,000 ₸**.
Her district kept the **default 4%**.

```
Simplified tax (H1) = 9,000,000 × 4% = 360,000 ₸
```

She files **Форма 910.00 by 15 Aug 2026** and pays **360,000 ₸ by 25 Aug 2026**. No separate social
tax. She still pays her own ОПВ/ОПВР/СО/ВОСМС monthly (see kz-social-contributions).

### Example 2 — Simplified declaration with a reduced maslikhat rate

Same Aigerim, but her city's **maslikhat set 2%** for IT activity (a −50% reduction).

```
Simplified tax (H1) = 9,000,000 × 2% = 180,000 ₸
```

The reduced rate must be **confirmed for her specific district and activity code (ОКЭД)** — the AI
should not assume it.

### Example 3 — Self-employed regime (replaces patent)

Daniyar tutors privately, was "on patent" in 2025, auto-moved to **self-employed** on 1 Jan 2026.
Monthly income = **400,000 ₸** (≈ 92 МРП, within the 300-МРП ceiling).

```
ИПН            = 0
Social payments = 400,000 × 4% = 16,000 ₸ per month
```

He self-assesses in **E-Salyq Business** and pays ~**16,000 ₸** monthly. If his monthly income ever
exceeds **300 МРП (≈ 1,297,500 ₸)**, he must register as an **ИП** and move to the simplified
declaration (or ОУР).

### Example 4 — Approaching the simplified ceiling

Marat (ИП, retail of non-excisable goods) had H1 turnover of **1,400,000,000 ₸** and projects H2 of
**1,300,000,000 ₸** → full-year ≈ **2,700,000,000 ₸**.

```
Annual ceiling = 600,000 МРП × 4,325 = 2,595,000,000 ₸
Projected 2,700,000,000 ₸  >  2,595,000,000 ₸  → ceiling BREACHED
```

He must move to the **general regime (ОУР)** and review **VAT registration** (kazakhstan-vat). Flag
this early — crossing the ceiling mid-year has transition consequences *(verify exact timing)*.

---

## 7. Tier 2 — refer to a Kazakhstan accountant / КГД

Escalate (do **not** self-resolve) when the matter involves:

- **ТОО (LLP) on the simplified declaration** beyond the basic rate — corporate (КПН) interactions,
  dividends, and accounting thresholds (e.g. the ~135,000 МРП bookkeeping-exemption line) *(verify)*.
- **Mid-year ceiling breach or forced VAT registration** and the precise effective date of the move
  to ОУР.
- **Peasant/farm-household regime (КХ)** — out of scope of this skill.
- **Maslikhat rates** — the exact reduced rate for a specific district + ОКЭД activity code.
- **Prohibited-activity classification** (whether a borderline activity is excluded from a regime).
- **Transition from the abolished patent/retail-tax regimes** including any carry-over balances,
  inventory, or de-registration mechanics.
- **Non-residents, branches, or cross-border** elements.
- Anything requiring the **exact 2026 Форма 910.00 line mapping** or a binding filing position.

---

## 8. Reference (Tax Code) + test suite

### 8.1 Legal & official references

- **Tax Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan (2026)** — Code No. 214-VIII of 18 Jul 2025, effective
  **1 Jan 2026** (special tax regimes chapter; simplified declaration & self-employed regime
  articles — *cite exact article numbers after verifying against the published 2026 Code*).
- **Repealed:** retail tax — former **ст. 696-1** (lost force 1 Jan 2026); patent regime; fixed-
  deduction regime.
- **State Revenue Committee (КГД)** — kgd.gov.kz; filing portal **cabinet.salyk.kz**; **E-Salyq
  Business** app; eGov (egov.kz).
- **PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries** — taxsummaries.pwc.com/kazakhstan (significant developments,
  other taxes) — for cross-checking rates.
- **МРП / МЗП 2026** — annual republican budget law: МРП **4,325 ₸**, МЗП **85,000 ₸** *(verify)*.

### 8.2 Self-check / test suite

The AI should pass all of these before giving a final answer:

1. **Patent request.** User: "Put me on patent for 2026." → Explain patent is **abolished**; offer
   self-employed or simplified instead. ✅
2. **Retail tax request.** User: "I'll use retail tax (розничный налог)." → Explain it is **repealed
   (ст. 696-1)**; features folded into simplified. ✅
3. **Rate default.** Simplified, no local rate confirmed → use **4%**, not 3%, and note maslikhat
   ±50%. ✅
4. **Social tax double-count.** Simplified ИП → do **not** add a separate social tax on top of the
   4% (2026 change). ✅
5. **Self-employed ceiling.** Income 1,500,000 ₸/month → exceeds **300 МРП**; must register ИП /
   move to simplified. ✅
6. **Simplified ceiling.** Annual turnover > **600,000 МРП** → move to ОУР + check VAT. ✅
7. **Deadlines.** H1 Форма 910.00 → file **15 Aug**, pay **25 Aug**; H2 → file **15 Feb**, pay
   **25 Feb** (next year). ✅
8. **Regime-choice trap.** No notification by **1 March** → auto **ОУР**. ✅
9. **VAT.** Special-regime ИП is **not** a VAT payer (import/non-resident excepted). ✅
10. **Language mirroring.** Reply in the user's language (RU/KK/EN) with native terms inline. ✅
11. **МРП conversion.** Convert ceilings using **4,325 ₸** (2026), flagged "verify". ✅
12. **Unverified figure.** Asked for an exact reduced district rate → give the **range 2%–6%** and
    say "confirm with the local maslikhat / КГД". ✅

---

## PROHIBITIONS

The AI must **NOT**:

- **Advise using the patent, retail tax, or fixed-deduction regime for 2026 or later** — all three
  were abolished by the 2026 Tax Code. Treating them as available is a hard error.
- **State a precise reduced (maslikhat) rate as fact** without the user confirming their district +
  activity. Default to 4% and present 2%–6% as the adjustable range.
- **Add a separate social tax (СН) on top of the 4%** for an ИП on the simplified declaration (the
  2026 code folded it in).
- **Confirm exact ₸ ceilings, article numbers, prohibited-activity lists, or due dates as settled
  law** without the "verify under 2026 Tax Code" caveat — the Code is new (in force only since
  1 Jan 2026) and subordinate acts/forms are still settling.
- **Handle VAT, the general regime (ОУР), peasant/farm regimes, ТОО corporate tax, non-residents,
  or social-contribution rates** here — route to the dedicated skills (kazakhstan-vat,
  kz-income-tax, kz-social-contributions) or to Tier 2.
- **File, sign, or submit** anything to КГД, or present output as a final filing position. This
  skill produces **draft computations and guidance only**.
