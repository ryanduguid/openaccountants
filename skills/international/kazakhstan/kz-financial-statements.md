# Kazakhstan Financial Statements & Reporting — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| ИП (sole proprietor) | Generally **no** formal financial statements — keeps tax records and files the tax return (see kz-bookkeeping, kz-simplified-regime) |
| Small entities (ТОО) | National Financial Reporting Standard (НСФО / NFRS) — simplified |
| Medium/large & public-interest entities | IFRS (МСФО) |
| Filing | Depository of Financial Statements (web portal of the Ministry of Finance) for entities required to publish |
| Standards body | Ministry of Finance; Tax authority КГД for tax filings |
| Currency | KZT |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| ИП asking about "financial statements" | Explain ИП files tax forms, not statutory statements |
| Entity size unknown | Default ТОО to NFRS (small) until size confirmed |

## Section 2 — Who prepares what (Tier 1)
- **ИП / self-employed:** no statutory financial statements. Obligations are the **tax return** (Form 910.00 simplified or 220.00 general) plus the tax registers in kz-bookkeeping. This is the key point for most freelancers.
- **Small ТОО:** the **National Financial Reporting Standard (НСФО)** — a simplified balance sheet + income statement.
- **Medium / large / public-interest entities (banks, listed, large):** **IFRS (МСФО)**, audited.

## Section 3 — Filing & audit
- Entities meeting the public-interest / size criteria submit financial statements to the **Depository of Financial Statements** and may require a **statutory audit** — verify the size thresholds for the obligation.
- Tax reporting (to the КГД) is separate from financial-statement publication.

## Section 4 — Worked example
A solo IT freelancer registered as an ИП on the simplified regime: prepares **no** financial statements — files **Form 910.00** half-yearly plus social payments. If they later incorporate a ТОО, NFRS statements begin.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER tell an ИП they must file statutory financial statements (they file tax forms).
- NEVER apply IFRS to a small ТОО by default — NFRS unless size requires IFRS.
- NEVER state audit/size thresholds without verifying current law.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify entity-size thresholds, standard choice, and audit/filing obligations with the Ministry of Finance / КГД. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Kazakhstan accountant. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
