# Kazakhstan Cryptocurrency & Digital Mining Tax — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Kazakhstan |
| Topic | Digital mining + digital-asset taxation |
| Currency | KZT (₸); many amounts indexed to MRP (МРП) = ₸4,325 for 2026 (verify against the 2026 budget law) |
| Individual income tax (ИПН) | Flat 10% |
| Mining electricity fee | Plata za tsifrovoy mayning (плата за цифровой майнинг) — a per-kWh charge on power used for mining, banded by the electricity price (verify current ₸/kWh band table) |
| Regulated trading | Only via exchanges licensed in the Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC / МФЦА); trading outside the AIFC is restricted |
| Tax authority | State Revenue Committee (КГД, kgd.gov.kz); AIFC for licensing |
| Legislation | Tax Code of Kazakhstan (2026); Law "On Digital Assets in the Republic of Kazakhstan" |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Whether the user is a licensed miner | Assume unlicensed → flag licensing requirement |
| Trading venue unknown | Assume non-AIFC → flag the restriction |
| Cost basis of disposed crypto unknown | Cannot compute gain — request acquisition records |
| Mining electricity band unknown | Flag for reviewer; do not guess the ₸/kWh fee |

## Section 2 — Legal & Regulatory Status

- **Two categories of digital assets:** *secured* (backed/tokenised real assets) and *unsecured* (e.g. Bitcoin). Issuance and "white-listed" trading are channelled through the **AIFC**.
- **Mining is legal but licensed.** Miners must be registered/licensed and buy power within the regulated framework; a dedicated **digital-mining fee** applies to the electricity consumed.
- **Exchange/trading** of unsecured digital assets by residents is intended to run through **AIFC-licensed exchanges**; peer-to-peer/offshore trading sits in a grey/restricted zone — flag it.

## Section 3 — Taxation (Tier 1)

### Mining income
- Income from mining (whether realised in crypto or fiat) is **business income** → corporate income tax (КПН, 20%) for entities or individual income tax (ИПН, 10%) for individuals, on the net result.
- The **digital-mining fee** on electricity is a **separate** charge on top of income tax, scaled to the price paid per kWh (cheaper power → higher fee). Verify the current band table.

### Individuals' gains on digital assets
- A gain on **disposal** of a digital asset (sale proceeds − documented acquisition cost) is **taxable income** for an individual at **ИПН 10%**, declared in the annual individual declaration. Losses and undocumented cost basis → flag.
- Crypto-to-crypto and timing rules under the 2026 Tax Code: **verify** (treat disposal-for-value as the taxable event by default).

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

**Example 1 — Individual sells BTC.** Buys BTC for ₸4,000,000, sells for ₸6,000,000. Gain ₸2,000,000 × 10% ИПН = **₸200,000**, declared in the annual return. (Requires acquisition proof.)

**Example 2 — Home miner.** Mines and sells coins for ₸3,000,000 in the year; documented costs ₸1,200,000. Net ₸1,800,000 taxed at ИПН 10% = ₸180,000, **plus** the digital-mining fee on the electricity consumed (separate). Licensing required.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER assert that offshore/P2P crypto trading by residents is unrestricted — it is channelled through the AIFC.
- NEVER compute a gain without documented acquisition cost.
- NEVER omit the digital-mining fee for miners — it is separate from income tax.
- NEVER state a specific ₸/kWh mining fee or VAT treatment without verifying the current 2026 figures.
- NEVER present a figure as final — direct the client to a Kazakhstan accountant.

## Disclaimer
This skill is informational only and not tax, legal, or financial advice. Kazakhstan's digital-asset and mining rules are evolving (new Tax Code 2026, AIFC rules) — verify current rates, the digital-mining fee bands, and licensing status with the КГД and AIFC. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Kazakhstan accountant before filing. The most up-to-date version is maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
