# Kazakhstan Business Formation (ИП / ТОО) — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Self-employed vehicle | Individual entrepreneur — ИП (индивидуальный предприниматель) |
| Company alternative | Limited liability partnership — ТОО (товарищество с ограниченной ответственностью) |
| Registration channel | eGov.kz / e-Salyq Business app / КГД; near-instant for ИП |
| Cost | ИП registration is free (state duty waived); ТОО has minimal cost |
| Tax regime chosen at registration | Simplified declaration (4%) vs general regime — see kz-simplified-regime |
| IT incentive | Astana Hub (astanahub.com) — participants get major tax relief on IT income (verify current relief) |
| VAT registration threshold | Mandatory once turnover exceeds the threshold (verify the 2026 figure — lowered under the new Tax Code); voluntary below |
| Tax authority | State Revenue Committee (КГД) |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Vehicle unknown | ИП for a solo freelancer; ТОО if liability protection / investors needed |
| Regime unknown | Simplified declaration (4%) for small turnover |
| IT activity | Check Astana Hub eligibility — large savings |

## Section 2 — Registering as an ИП (Tier 1)
1. Have an IIN (ИИН individual identification number) and an EDS (digital signature) or Biometric login.
2. Register via **eGov / e-Salyq Business** — notification-based, effectively same-day.
3. Choose the **tax regime** (simplified declaration / general) and pick **OKED activity codes**.
4. Decide on **VAT registration** (mandatory above the threshold; voluntary below).
5. Open a business bank account; set up e-invoicing (ЭСФ) if required (see kz-einvoice).

## Section 3 — ТОО vs ИП
| Factor | ИП | ТОО |
|---|---|---|
| Liability | Personal | Limited to the company |
| Setup | Instant, free | Charter + registration |
| Tax | Simplified/general personal | CIT 20% (or simplified for small ТОО) |
| Best for | Solo freelancers | Teams, investors, higher risk |

## Section 4 — Astana Hub (IT)
IT companies/entrepreneurs accredited by **Astana Hub** receive substantial tax relief on qualifying IT income (historically exemption from CIT/IIT, VAT, and social tax on payroll for participants). Verify the current 2026 relief and eligibility — significant for software/IT freelancers.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER advise skipping VAT registration once over the threshold.
- NEVER assume Astana Hub relief without confirming accreditation + current rules.
- NEVER state the VAT threshold or Astana Hub benefits without verifying the 2026 figures.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify registration steps, the VAT threshold, and Astana Hub relief with the КГД / Astana Hub. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Kazakhstan accountant before relying on them. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
