# Kazakhstan Payroll & Salary Taxes — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Item | Who pays | Rate (verify under 2026 Tax Code) |
|---|---|---|
| Individual income tax (ИПН) | Employee (withheld) | 10% |
| Mandatory pension (ОПВ) | Employee | 10% of salary |
| Employer pension contribution (ОПВР) | Employer | ~2.5% in 2025, scheduled to rise (verify 2026) |
| Social contributions (СО) | Employer | ~3.5% |
| Mandatory medical — employee (ВОСМС) | Employee | 2% |
| Mandatory medical — employer (ОСМС) | Employer | 3% |
| Social tax (СН) | Employer | ~9.5%, reduced by СО paid (verify) |
| Currency / indexation | — | KZT; MRP (МРП) ₸4,325, min wage (МЗП) ₸85,000 for 2026 (verify) |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tax authority | State Revenue Committee (КГД, kgd.gov.kz) |
| Reporting | Form 200.00 (quarterly) |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Kazakhstan accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Standard ИПН deduction (1 MZP) applicability | Apply the 14 MRP / 1 MZP monthly deduction only on the employee's main place of work |
| Contribution caps | Apply the statutory upper income cap (e.g. 50× min wage) per contribution — verify the 2026 cap |
| Employee vs ИП contractor | If the worker is a registered ИП invoicing the company, payroll does NOT apply — flag misclassification risk |

## Section 2 — Computation order (Tier 1)
1. **ОПВ 10%** is withheld from gross and is **deductible before ИПН**.
2. **ВОСМС 2%** withheld; also reduces the ИПН base.
3. Apply the **standard deduction** (1 minimum wage / 14 MRP per month, main job only).
4. **ИПН 10%** on the remaining base, withheld.
5. Employer pays, on top: **ОПВР, СО, ОСМС 3%, social tax** (social tax reduced by СО).

## Section 3 — Worked Example
Gross ₸500,000/month, main job:
- ОПВ 10% = ₸50,000; ВОСМС 2% = ₸10,000.
- Base after ОПВ + ВОСМС + 1 MZP deduction (₸85,000) = 500,000 − 50,000 − 10,000 − 85,000 = ₸355,000.
- ИПН 10% = ₸35,500. **Net to employee ≈ ₸404,500.**
- Employer on top: ОПВР, СО, ОСМС 3%, social tax (verify exact rates).

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER apply the 1 MZP standard deduction to a second job.
- NEVER skip ОПВ-before-ИПН ordering.
- NEVER treat a registered ИП contractor as payroll — but flag disguised employment.
- NEVER state employer rates as final without verifying the 2026 Tax Code values.
