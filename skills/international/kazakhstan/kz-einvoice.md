| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Whether ЭСФ is mandatory | If VAT-registered or dealing in tracked/imported goods → assume mandatory |
| Cash/card retail sales | Assume an online ККМ + fiscal receipt is required (narrow exemptions) |

## Section 2 — Electronic invoices (ЭСФ)
- Issued and stored in the **ИС ЭСФ** portal; deadlines run from the date of turnover (commonly within 15 calendar days — verify).
- **Mandatory** for VAT payers, for traceable/imported goods, and for certain government-supply and traceability cases. A non-VAT small ИП on the simplified regime generally is **not** required to issue ЭСФ for ordinary services — verify against current КГД rules.
- A correctly issued ЭСФ is the basis for the buyer's VAT offset.

## Section 3 — Online cash registers (ККМ) & ОФД
- Businesses making cash/card sales to the public must use an **online ККМ** that transmits fiscal data to an **ОФД** in real time and issue a fiscal receipt (incl. QR).
- Narrow exemptions exist (e.g. certain remote-area or activity exemptions) — verify.

## Section 4 — E-waybill (СНТ)
For goods subject to traceability (imports, excisable, virtual-warehouse items), a **СНТ** must accompany movement and be registered electronically.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER tell a VAT payer they can skip ЭСФ.
- NEVER assume cash retail is exempt from online ККМ without checking the exemption list.
- NEVER state ЭСФ deadlines or scope without verifying current КГД rules.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify ЭСФ scope, deadlines, and ККМ rules with the КГД. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Kazakhstan accountant before relying on them. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
