### Tax Rate Brackets (2025; rates unchanged into 2026 per PwC review 27 March 2026)

**IMPORTANT — two different bases.** Employment (salary) brackets are applied **per MONTH on gross salary**. Self-employment / business (entrepreneur) brackets are applied **per YEAR on annual income**. Do not mix the two thresholds. (PwC.)

**Employment Income — MONTHLY gross salary** (PwC, reviewed 27 Mar 2026)

| Monthly Gross (EUR) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 700.00 | 0% | EUR 0.00 |
| 700.01 -- 1,000.00 | 9% | EUR 27.00 |
| 1,000.01+ | 15% | -- |

> Check: at EUR 1,000 gross, PIT = (1,000 − 700) × 9% = EUR 27.00. At EUR 1,500 gross, PIT = 27.00 + (1,500 − 1,000) × 15% = 27.00 + 75.00 = **EUR 102.00**.

**Self-Employment / Business (Entrepreneur) Income — ANNUAL** (PwC, reviewed 27 Mar 2026)

| Annual Income (EUR) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 8,400.00 | 0% | EUR 0.00 |
| 8,400.01 -- 12,000.00 | 9% | EUR 324.00 |
| 12,000.01+ | 15% | -- |

> Check: at EUR 12,000 annual, PIT = (12,000 − 8,400) × 9% = EUR 324.00. At EUR 20,000 annual, PIT = 324.00 + (20,000 − 12,000) × 15% = 324.00 + 1,200.00 = **EUR 1,524.00**.

**Other Income — flat 15%** (PwC, reviewed 27 Mar 2026)

| Income Type | Rate |
|---|---|
| Rental (property) income | 15% flat |
| Dividends | 15% flat |
| Interest | 15% flat |
| Royalties | 15% flat |
| Capital gains | 15% flat |

**Gaming / Gambling Winnings — progressive** (PwC, reviewed 27 Mar 2026)

| Winnings (EUR) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 50.00 | 0% | EUR 0.00 |
| 50.01 -- 1,500.00 | 10% | EUR 145.00 |
| 1,500.01+ | 15% | -- |

> Check: at EUR 1,500 winnings, tax = (1,500 − 50) × 10% = EUR 145.00.

### Municipal Surtax (Prirez)

The municipal surtax is levied **ON the PIT amount assessed**, NOT on income. It is a tax-on-tax. (PwC.)

| Municipality | Surtax Rate (of PIT due) |
|---|---|
| Podgorica | 15% |
| Cetinje | 15% |
| All other municipalities | 13% |

> Effective top marginal rate in Podgorica/Cetinje = 15% PIT × 1.15 = **17.25%**. In other municipalities = 15% × 1.13 = **16.95%**.

### Social Contributions (post-Europe-Now-2, effective 1 October 2024) (PwC)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pension & disability insurance (PIO) | 10.0% | 0.0% | 10.0% |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.5% | 0.5% | 1.0% |
| Health insurance | 0.0% (abolished 1 Jan 2022) | 0.0% (abolished 1 Jan 2022) | 0.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **10.5%** | **0.5%** | **11.0%** |

> Column check — Employee: 10.0 + 0.5 + 0.0 = **10.5%**. Employer: 0.0 + 0.5 + 0.0 = **0.5%**. Total: 10.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 = **11.0%** (= 10.5 + 0.5). Confirmed.

- Employer share of pension/disability was **abolished from 1 October 2024** under Europe Now 2 (PwC).
- Compulsory **health insurance contributions were abolished from 1 January 2022** under Europe Now 1 (previously 8.5% employee + 2.3% employer = 10.8%); health is now funded from general taxation (Orbitax/KPMG).
- Pension/disability contributions are capped at an **annual contribution base of EUR 68,765** (2024 figure cited by PwC; indexed by the PIO Fund). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2025/2026 indexed ceiling with the PIO Fund.]

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown contribution structure / vintage | Use post-Europe-Now-2 (Oct 2024): employee 10.5%, employer 0.5%, no health contribution |
| Surtax basis | Apply surtax to the PIT amount, never to income |
| Unknown municipality | 13% surtax (the most common rate); flag for reviewer |
| Salary vs self-employment band confusion | Salary = monthly bands; self-employment = annual bands |
| Unknown residency | STOP — do not determine worldwide vs source taxation without residency |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Pre-reform contribution rates seen in a source | Treat as STALE — do not use |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- for an employee: monthly gross salary and the municipality of employment. For a sole proprietor (preduzetnik): bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text) plus the municipality and confirmation of residency.

**Recommended** -- all sales/purchase invoices, IOPPD monthly reports filed during the year, prior-year GPP-FL return, VAT registration status, confirmation of which Europe-Now contribution vintage applies to the period.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, contribution-base records (for the EUR 68,765 ceiling check), proof of any other income (rental, dividends, interest), and confirmation of centre-of-interests for residency.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement (for a sole proprietor) at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the business-purpose test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-ME-1 -- Municipality unknown.** "The municipal surtax (prirez) is 13% in most municipalities but 15% in Podgorica and Cetinje. This skill will default to 13% and flag it, but please confirm the municipality before finalising."

**R-ME-2 -- Companies / corporate income tax.** "This skill covers personal income tax for individuals and sole proprietors only. Corporate income tax (porez na dobit) on companies (d.o.o., a.d.) is a separate regime. Escalate to a Montenegrin licensed accountant."

**R-ME-3 -- Non-resident / cross-border income.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation, treaty relief, and foreign-source income require specialised analysis. Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Montenegro-source income only. Out of scope. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-ME-4 -- Pension/disability ceiling cases.** "Income above the annual contribution base ceiling (EUR 68,765, 2024 figure) requires the indexed current-year ceiling, which must be confirmed with the PIO Fund. Escalate to a licensed accountant before relying on a capped figure."

**R-ME-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax/contribution arrears or is subject to Revenue and Customs Administration enforcement. Default interest and misdemeanor fines apply and exact amounts could not be confirmed in research. Do not advise. Escalate to a licensed accountant immediately."

**R-ME-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax and payroll withholding only. Montenegro VAT (PDV, standard 21%) is a separate skill/regime."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for a sole proprietor (preduzetnik) bank statement. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. Montenegrin (Crna Gora) statement text mixes Montenegrin/Serbian and English. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Employee Monthly Salary, Podgorica (above 0% band)

**Input line:**
`31/03/2025 ; CKB UPLATA ; POSLODAVAC DOO ; ZARADA MART 2025 ; +1,200.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Employment income, EUR 1,200 gross/month, employed in Podgorica (15% surtax).

- PIT: 0% on first 700 = 0.00; 9% on (1,000 − 700 = 300) = 27.00; 15% on (1,200 − 1,000 = 200) = 30.00. PIT = 27.00 + 30.00 = **EUR 57.00**.
- Surtax (Podgorica 15% of PIT): 57.00 × 15% = **EUR 8.55**.
- Employee social contributions: 1,200 × 10.5% = **EUR 126.00**.
- Net pay = 1,200.00 − 57.00 − 8.55 − 126.00 = **EUR 1,008.45**.

**Classification:** Employment income, monthly bands. Net pay EUR 1,008.45.

### Example 2 -- Employee at the 0% Threshold (minimum-wage band)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; NLB DOZNAKA ; POSLODAVAC DOO ; ZARADA APRIL ; +700.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Gross EUR 700/month falls entirely within the 0% PIT band (PwC: first EUR 700 taxed at 0%).

- PIT = **EUR 0.00**. Surtax = 0% of 0 = **EUR 0.00**.
- Employee social contributions: 700 × 10.5% = **EUR 73.50**.
- Net pay = 700.00 − 0.00 − 73.50 = **EUR 626.50**.

**Classification:** Employment income, fully within the 0% band. Only social contributions apply.

### Example 3 -- Sole Proprietor Annual Profit (other municipality, 13% surtax)

**Input:** Annual business income EUR 20,000; allowable expenses already netted; municipality with 13% surtax.

**Reasoning (self-employment ANNUAL bands):**
- PIT: 0% on first 8,400 = 0.00; 9% on (12,000 − 8,400 = 3,600) = 324.00; 15% on (20,000 − 12,000 = 8,000) = 1,200.00. PIT = 324.00 + 1,200.00 = **EUR 1,524.00**.
- Surtax (13% of PIT): 1,524.00 × 13% = **EUR 198.12**.
- Total PIT + surtax = 1,524.00 + 198.12 = **EUR 1,722.12**.

**Classification:** Self-employment income, annual bands. Total PIT + surtax EUR 1,722.12 (contributions computed separately — see Tier 1).

### Example 4 -- Rental Income (flat 15%)

**Input line:**
`05/02/2025 ; ERSTE PRENOS ; ZAKUPAC ; ZAKUP STANA FEB ; +500.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Rental income is taxed at a flat 15% (PwC), not on the progressive SE bands. (Any statutory standardised cost deduction against rental income is a reviewer item.)

- PIT on gross 500: 500 × 15% = **EUR 75.00** (before any allowable cost deduction — flag for reviewer).

**Classification:** Other income, flat 15%. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] whether a standardised expense allowance reduces the rental base.

### Example 5 -- Software Subscription (Deductible)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2025 ; CKB KARTICA ; ADOBE SYSTEMS IRELAND ; CREATIVE CLOUD APR ; -29.99 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, business use. Fully deductible as an operating expense against business income. For VAT-registered sole proprietors, the net (excl. recoverable 21% VAT) is the expense.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense EUR 29.99 (or net of recoverable VAT if VAT-registered).

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; CKB INTERNI PRENOS ; SOPSTVENI RAČUN - ŠTEDNJA ; ; -2,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Employment Income — Monthly Progressive PIT

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax (Zakon o porezu na dohodak fizičkih lica).

Salary is taxed monthly: 0% on the first EUR 700 gross, 9% on EUR 700.01–1,000, 15% above EUR 1,000 (PwC, reviewed 27 Mar 2026). The employer withholds PIT and employee contributions and remits monthly (PAYE-style). The 0% band on the first EUR 700 means most minimum-wage and low earners pay no PIT.

### 5.2 Self-Employment / Business Income — Annual Progressive PIT

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax.

Entrepreneur (preduzetnik) income is taxed annually: 0% up to EUR 8,400, 9% on EUR 8,400.01–12,000, 15% above EUR 12,000 (PwC). Apply to net annual business income after allowable expenses.

> [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] Whether the EUR 700 monthly 0% band is also reflected proportionally in self-employment computations versus the EUR 8,400 annual band should be confirmed by the accountant reviewer.

### 5.3 Other Income — Flat 15%

Rental, dividend, interest, royalty, and capital-gains income are taxed at a flat 15% (PwC). These do not use the progressive bands.

### 5.4 Gaming / Gambling Winnings — Progressive

0% up to EUR 50, 10% on EUR 50.01–1,500, 15% above EUR 1,500 (PwC).

### 5.5 Municipal Surtax (Prirez)

**Legislation:** Law on Local Self-Government Financing.

Surtax is charged ON the PIT amount: 13% in most municipalities, 15% in Podgorica and Cetinje (PwC). It is a tax-on-tax — never add it to the income rate. Effective top marginal = 17.25% (Podgorica/Cetinje) or 16.95% (other municipalities).

### 5.6 Social Contributions

**Legislation:** Law on Contributions for Mandatory Social Insurance.

| Item | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| Pension & disability (PIO) | 10.0% | 0.0% (abolished Oct 2024) |
| Unemployment | 0.5% | 0.5% |
| Health | 0.0% (abolished Jan 2022) | 0.0% (abolished Jan 2022) |
| **Total** | **10.5%** | **0.5%** |

Pension/disability is capped at an annual contribution base of EUR 68,765 (2024 figure cited by PwC; indexed by the PIO Fund). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current-year indexed ceiling.]

> A possible employer "labor fund" / professional-rehabilitation-of-disabled-persons levy and chamber/union contributions appear in some guides but were NOT confirmed on PwC for the current period. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm with the Revenue and Customs Administration before relying on them.]

### 5.7 Payroll Burden Summary

- **Employer total payroll burden:** only 0.5% unemployment insurance on top of gross salary (pension/disability and health employer shares abolished) (PwC).
- **Employee total deductions:** 10.5% social contributions + progressive PIT (0/9/15%) + municipal surtax on the PIT amount (PwC).

### 5.8 Non-Deductible Expenses (Sole Proprietors)

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / owner withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Private-portion of mixed-use costs | Only business portion deductible |

### 5.9 VAT Interaction

**Standard VAT (PDV) rate: 21%** (PwC). Mandatory registration once taxable turnover exceeds **EUR 30,000** in the preceding 12 months (register within 10 days); voluntary registration allowed below (PwC).

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT collected on sales (registered) | NOT income — exclude |
| Input VAT recovered (registered) | NOT an expense — exclude |
| Not VAT-registered | Gross amount is the cost/income |

### 5.10 Residency

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax.

Resident if present at least 183 days in the tax year, OR has domicile / centre of personal and economic interests in Montenegro (PwC). Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Montenegro-source income only.

### 5.11 Filing Deadlines and Penalties

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Annual PIT return (GPP-FL) | 30 April of the following year (PwC/forms) |
| Monthly payroll report (IOPPD) + payment | 15th of the following month (Rivermate) |
| Late payment of tax/contributions | Statutory default interest accrues; fines and audit exposure. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact default-interest rate and fine amounts from the Tax Administration Law and Law on Contributions.] |
| Non-compliance / repeated | Intensified inspections, possible restrictions on business operations, misdemeanor fines for failure to file/register (Rivermate). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm fine amounts.] |

### 5.12 Minimum Wage (context, not a tax figure)

Dual-tier NET minimum wage since Sept 2024: EUR 670 net/month for jobs requiring up to a high-school diploma; EUR 800 net/month for jobs requiring a university degree / higher qualification; reviewed every 6 months by the Government (RemotePeople). Minimum wage is stated NET; the gross equivalent depends on the contribution gross-up and must be computed, not assumed.

- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the correct depreciation method/rate for each asset class before capitalising. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm.]

### 6.5 Rental-Income Standardised Cost Deduction

- Some regimes allow a standardised percentage deduction against gross rental income before the 15% flat tax.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm whether a standardised cost deduction applies and at what percentage. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm.]

### 6.6 Contribution Ceiling Application

- Pension/disability is capped at an annual base (EUR 68,765, 2024 figure).
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the current-year indexed ceiling and apply the cap for high earners. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm with PIO Fund.]

### 6.7 Europe-Now Vintage / Stale-Rate Risk

- Many EOR/payroll guides still publish PRE-REFORM contribution rates (employee 15% pension + 8.5% health; employer 5.5% + 2.3%). These are STALE.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the period falls under the post-1-Oct-2024 structure (employee 10.5%, employer 0.5%, no health). If the period straddles a reform date, escalate.

### Forms

| Form | Purpose | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| GPP-FL (Obrazac GPP-FL, Schedule A) | Annual PIT return for sole proprietors and individuals with reportable income | 30 April of the following year |
| IOPPD (Obrazac IOPPD) | Monthly report on calculated and paid PIT and social contributions (payroll/withholding) | 15th of the following month; contributions paid simultaneously |
| Annual income statement to employee | Employer summary of annual earnings and withheld taxes/contributions | Annual (end of tax year) |

### CRITICAL Stale-Data Warning

Many EOR/payroll secondary guides (e.g. Rivermate, some 2025/2026 guides) still list PRE-REFORM social contribution rates — employee 15% pension + 8.5% health, employer 5.5% pension + 2.3% health + labour-fund levy. **These are OUTDATED.** The Europe Now reforms abolished health contributions (1 Jan 2022) and the employer pension/disability share, and cut the employee pension rate to 10% (1 Oct 2024). PwC (reviewed 27 March 2026), KPMG Montenegro, and Orbitax confirm the current structure: **employee 10.5% total, employer 0.5% only, no health contribution.** Always use the post-reform figures.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee, Podgorica, EUR 1,200 gross/month.**
Input: monthly gross EUR 1,200; Podgorica (15% surtax).
Expected: PIT = 27.00 + 30.00 = EUR 57.00; surtax = 57.00 × 15% = EUR 8.55; contributions = 1,200 × 10.5% = EUR 126.00; **net pay = EUR 1,008.45**.

**Test 2 -- Employee at the 0% band, EUR 700 gross/month.**
Input: monthly gross EUR 700.
Expected: PIT = EUR 0.00; surtax = EUR 0.00; contributions = 700 × 10.5% = EUR 73.50; **net pay = EUR 626.50**.

**Test 3 -- Sole proprietor, EUR 20,000 annual profit, other municipality (13%).**
Input: annual net profit EUR 20,000; 13% surtax.

**Test 4 -- Sole proprietor at the SE 0% ceiling, EUR 8,400 annual.**
Input: annual net profit EUR 8,400.

**Test 5 -- Rental income, EUR 500/month, flat 15%.**
Input: gross rent EUR 500 (one month).
Expected: PIT = 500 × 15% = EUR 75.00 (before any standardised cost deduction — flag for reviewer).

**Test 6 -- Gaming winnings EUR 1,500.**
Input: winnings EUR 1,500.
Expected: tax = (1,500 − 50) × 10% = EUR 145.00.

**Test 7 -- Employer payroll burden, EUR 1,000 gross/month.**
Input: monthly gross EUR 1,000.
Expected: employer contributions = 1,000 × 0.5% = EUR 5.00 (unemployment only); no employer pension/health.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the salary monthly bands to self-employment income, or the annual SE bands to a salary — they are different bases
- NEVER add the municipal surtax to the income rate — it is a tax ON the PIT amount (13% / 15%)
- NEVER use pre-Europe-Now contribution rates (e.g. 15% employee pension, 8.5% health, employer 5.5%/2.3%) — they are STALE
- NEVER apply a health-insurance contribution — it was abolished 1 Jan 2022
- NEVER charge an employer pension/disability contribution for periods after 1 Oct 2024 — it was abolished
- NEVER determine worldwide vs source taxation without confirming residency
- NEVER apply an asset depreciation rate without reviewer confirmation (research gap)
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales as income for a VAT-registered client
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, income tax, or owner drawings as deductions
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated, pending professional review
