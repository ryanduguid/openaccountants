  Use this skill whenever asked about Ukrainian financial statements and financial reporting
  (фінансова звітність) for legal entities, or whether a self-employed person must prepare them.
  Trigger on phrases like "Ukraine financial statements", "фінансова звітність", "П(С)БО", "НП(С)БО",
  "IFRS Ukraine", "МСФЗ", "do I file accounts as a FOP", "balance sheet Ukraine", "звіт про
  фінансові результати", "Форма 1-м", "Форма 1-мс", "enterprise size category Ukraine", "micro small
  medium large enterprise Ukraine", "statutory audit Ukraine", "Держстат financial report",
  "ТОВ financial statements", or any question about who must prepare and file financial statements,
  which accounting standards apply, the simplified report forms, deadlines, or audit obligations.
  This skill is about FORMAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for legal entities. A FOP (sole proprietor) does
  NOT prepare these — defer FOP records to ua-bookkeeping and FOP tax to ua-single-tax / ua-income-tax.
  ALWAYS read this skill before any Ukrainian financial-statement or financial-reporting work.

# Ukraine Financial Statements & Financial Reporting — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill explains who in Ukraine must prepare **formal financial statements** (фінансова
звітність), which accounting standards apply (national П(С)БО / НП(С)БО vs international МСФЗ /
IFRS), the enterprise size categories that drive the report form, where statements are filed,
the deadlines, and statutory audit obligations.

**The headline for a self-employed reader:** a Ukrainian sole proprietor — **ФОП** (фізична
особа-підприємець) — does **NOT** prepare formal financial statements at all. A ФОП keeps
income / income-and-expense ledgers and files a single-tax or property-and-income (general-system)
declaration. Formal financial statements are an obligation of **legal entities** (юридичні особи)
— a **ТОВ** (товариство з обмеженою відповідальністю / limited liability company) and similar.
This skill tells the self-employed reader exactly where that line sits and what changes if they
incorporate a ТОВ.

For ФОП record-keeping read **ua-bookkeeping**; for single-tax groups, rates and limits read
**ua-single-tax**; for general-system personal income tax read **ua-income-tax**; for VAT read
**ukraine-vat**.

| Standards | **П(С)БО / НП(С)БО** (National Accounting Standards) for most companies; **МСФЗ / IFRS** mandatory for banks, public-interest entities (PIEs), large enterprises, securities issuers and mineral extractors — see Section 4 |
| Currency | UAH (₴) — statements are presented in thousands of hryvnia |
| Primary legislation | Law of Ukraine **№996-XIV** "On Accounting and Financial Reporting in Ukraine" (Про бухгалтерський облік та фінансову звітність в Україні); **НП(С)БО 1** (general-purpose statements); **НП(С)БО 25** (simplified statements for micro/small); Law **№2258-VIII** "On audit of financial statements and auditing activity" |

> **Reporting period.** The financial year in Ukraine is the **calendar year** (1 January –
> 31 December). Figures, forms and thresholds are stated as of **May 2026** for the 2025 reporting
> year filed in 2026.

> **Threshold currency caveat.** The size thresholds in this skill are expressed in **EUR** in
> §996-XIV. They are applied by converting the EUR figures to UAH at the **NBU rate at the balance
> sheet date** (31 December). Always recompute with the current rate.

### Conservative defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, default to the more cautious reporting posture:

1. **A ФОП files no financial statements — but confirm the legal form first.** If the client says
   "my company" or "ТОВ", they are a legal entity and this skill applies. If they are a ФОП,
   redirect to ua-bookkeeping / ua-single-tax and do not produce a balance sheet.
2. **Default a new/unknown legal entity to "small enterprise"** reporting (full НП(С)БО 1 set or
   simplified Форма 1-м/2-м) unless figures clearly place it in micro or in medium/large. Never
   default a company *down* into micro and skip required disclosures.
3. **When size sits near a threshold, classify by two-of-three over the prior year**, and treat the
   higher category as the safe assumption pending confirmed figures.
4. **Assume an audit may be required** for any medium or large entity, PIE or securities issuer
   until proven otherwise (Section 5). Do not state "no audit needed" without checking all criteria.
5. **Use only the IFRS Ukrainian translation published by the Ministry of Finance** where IFRS
   applies — statutory statements must rely on the official translation, not the IASB English text.
6. **Flag, don't guess.** If the legal form, prior-year size indicators, or PIE status are unknown,
   ask. State assumptions explicitly in any draft.

## Section 2 — FOP vs Legal Entity: What Each Files

This is the core distinction. Get it wrong and you either burden a sole proprietor with company
obligations they do not have, or you let a ТОВ skip statutory statements.

### A sole proprietor (ФОП / фізична особа-підприємець)

- **Does NOT prepare financial statements.** There is no balance sheet, no profit-and-loss
  statement, no Держстат financial report for a ФОП. The Law §996-XIV applies to *legal entities*,
  not to individuals registered as entrepreneurs.
- **Keeps simplified records instead:** an income ledger (Книга обліку доходів) or
  income-and-expense ledger, plus primary documents. See **ua-bookkeeping**.
- **Files a tax declaration, not accounts:**
  - **Single-tax groups 1–2:** annual single-tax declaration (декларація платника єдиного податку).
  - **Single-tax group 3:** quarterly single-tax declaration.
  - **General system:** annual property-and-income declaration (податкова декларація про майновий
    стан і доходи). See **ua-single-tax** and **ua-income-tax** for which regime and the figures.
- A ФОП may still owe **VAT returns** if VAT-registered (see ukraine-vat) and **ЄСВ / unified social
  contribution** — but these are tax filings, not financial statements.

### A legal entity (юридична особа — e.g. ТОВ)

- **MUST keep double-entry accounting and prepare financial statements** under §996-XIV from the
  date of state registration.
- A standard general-purpose set under **НП(С)БО 1** comprises:
  1. **Баланс (Звіт про фінансовий стан)** — Balance Sheet / Statement of Financial Position (Форма №1)
  2. **Звіт про фінансові результати (Звіт про сукупний дохід)** — Statement of Financial Results /
     Comprehensive Income (Форма №2)
  3. **Звіт про рух грошових коштів** — Statement of Cash Flows (Форма №3)
  4. **Звіт про власний капітал** — Statement of Changes in Equity (Форма №4)
  5. **Примітки до фінансової звітності** — Notes to the financial statements (Форма №5)
- **Micro and small enterprises file a reduced set** (see Section 3).
- **Medium and large enterprises** also prepare a **management report** (звіт про управління), and
  large enterprises/PIEs additional disclosures.
- Files annually with **ДПС** (usually together with the corporate income tax return / податок на
  прибуток) and with **Держстат**; medium/large/PIEs also **publish**.

> **"If I incorporate a ТОВ, what changes?"** Everything in the table above flips on. You move from
> a ledger + single-tax declaration to double-entry bookkeeping, a full or simplified set of
> financial statements under П(С)БО (or IFRS if you fall into a mandatory category), filing with
> both ДПС and Держстат, and — if you grow into the medium/large/PIE brackets — a statutory audit.
> Many small ТОВ keep simplified Форма 1-м/2-м statements and never need an audit; the burden scales
> with size.

---

## Section 3 — Enterprise Size Categories and Which Report Form

Under Article 2 of Law §996-XIV, every legal entity falls into one of four size categories. A
company belongs to a category if, **at the balance sheet date, it meets at least two of the three
criteria** for that category. Categories are re-tested each year using the prior year's indicators.

### Size criteria (§996-XIV, EUR thresholds applied at the NBU rate at 31 December)

| Category | Balance-sheet assets | Net revenue | Average headcount |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Micro** (мікропідприємство) | up to **€350,000** | up to **€700,000** | up to **10** |
| **Small** (мале) | up to **€4,000,000** | up to **€8,000,000** | up to **50** |
| **Medium** (середнє) | up to **€20,000,000** | up to **€40,000,000** | up to **250** |
| **Large** (велике) | over **€20,000,000** | over **€40,000,000** | over **250** |

> **⚠ UNCERTAIN — two competing threshold sets.** Law **№4196-IX (9 January 2025)** introduced
> **EU-aligned** size criteria (Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC): broadly micro ≈ ≤9 staff and
> ≤€2m, small ≈ ≤49 staff and ≤€10m, medium ≈ ≤249 staff and ≤€50m revenue / ≤€43m assets. There is
> genuine ambiguity in mid-2026 sources about which set governs the **accounting/financial-reporting
> form and audit** versus general SME-status classification. The €350k/€700k/€4m/€8m/€20m/€40m set
> above is the one historically embedded in §996-XIV for *financial-reporting* purposes; the
> №4196-IX set harmonises *enterprise classification* with EU law. **Verify the operative thresholds
> for the specific 2025 reporting year against the current consolidated text of §996-XIV before
> classifying — do not rely on these figures unchecked.** Flag this to the reviewer.

### Which report form by category

| Category | Standard | Statement set / form |
|---|---|---|
| **Micro** | НП(С)БО 25 | **Скорочена** (simplified): **Форма №1-мс** (Balance) + **Форма №2-мс** (Financial Results) — a single condensed Balance + Financial Results report. May voluntarily use Форма 1-м/2-м or the full set. |
| **Small** | НП(С)БО 25 | **Малий** simplified set: **Форма №1-м** (Balance) + **Форма №2-м** (Financial Results). |
| **Medium** | НП(С)БО 1 (or IFRS if a PIE/large) | **Full** set: Форми №1–№5 + **management report** (звіт про управління). |
| **Large** | **МСФЗ / IFRS (mandatory)** | **Full** set: Форми №1–№5 + management report + additional disclosures; PIEs add a payments-to-government / non-financial statement where applicable. |

Notes:
- **Форма 1-мс / 2-мс** (micro) and **Форма 1-м / 2-м** (small) are the simplified statements under
  **НП(С)БО 25**. Form 2-мс reports for the *reporting year* rather than at a *date*; Form 1-мс is
  the condensed Balance.
- Since 17 February 2023, certain single-tax group-3 *legal entities* on simplified accounting may
  **choose** between the 1-мс/2-мс and the 1-м/2-м forms.
- A micro or small company **may always voluntarily prepare a fuller set** (e.g. for lenders).
- Form selection follows the **size category**, not the tax regime, except where the simplified-
  accounting election expands the menu of permitted forms.

## Section 4 — П(С)БО / НП(С)БО vs IFRS (МСФЗ)

Ukraine runs two parallel reporting frameworks. The default is national standards; IFRS is
mandatory for a defined list of higher-stakes entities.

### National Accounting Standards — П(С)БО / НП(С)БО

- "**П(С)БО**" (Положення (стандарти) бухгалтерського обліку) is the long-standing label;
  newer/updated standards are issued as "**НП(С)БО**" (Національні положення (стандарти)
  бухгалтерського обліку). In practice the two terms are used interchangeably.
- Set and maintained by the **Ministry of Finance of Ukraine** (Мінфін).
- **НП(С)БО 1** governs the general-purpose statements (Forms 1–5); **НП(С)БО 25** governs the
  simplified micro/small statements (Forms 1-мс/2-мс and 1-м/2-м).
- The **default framework** for companies that are not in a mandatory-IFRS category.

### International Financial Reporting Standards — МСФЗ / IFRS

IFRS (Міжнародні стандарти фінансової звітності) is **mandatory** for the following entities under
§996-XIV:

- **Banks** (since 2011).
- **Public-interest entities (PIEs / підприємства, що становлять суспільний інтерес):** securities
  issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on a stock exchange; **banks**; **insurers**;
  **non-state pension funds**; **other financial institutions** (except those that are micro/small);
  and entities that qualify as **large enterprises**.
- **Public joint-stock companies** (публічні акціонерні товариства).
- **Large enterprises** (per the size criteria in Section 3).
- **Enterprises engaged in extraction of minerals of national importance.**
- **Securities issuers** and **parent companies of PIE groups** preparing consolidated statements.

Other companies — including most **ТОВ**, micro and small entities — use **П(С)БО**, but **any
company may voluntarily adopt IFRS**. Entities that fall into a mandatory-IFRS category and most
others file financial statements electronically in **XBRL/iXBRL** taxonomy format via the
single-window financial-reporting system.

> **Statutory translation rule.** Where IFRS applies, statutory statements must use the **Ukrainian
> translation of IFRS published by the Ministry of Finance**, not the IASB English original.

---

## Section 5 — Statutory Audit Requirements

Mandatory statutory audit (обов'язковий аудит фінансової звітності) is governed by Law **№2258-VIII**.
A statutory audit of the annual financial statements is required for:

- **Public-interest entities (PIEs)** — banks, insurers, non-state pension funds, other financial
  institutions (other than micro/small), exchange-traded securities issuers, and entities classified
  as large.
- **Large enterprises.**
- **Medium-sized enterprises.**
- **Public joint-stock companies.**
- **Securities issuers** whose securities are admitted to exchange trading or are publicly offered.
- **Subjects of natural monopolies** on the national market.
- **Enterprises engaged in extraction of minerals of national importance.**

**Micro and small enterprises are generally NOT subject to mandatory audit** (a financial
institution that is micro/small is treated as the relevant exception case — verify per entity).

Additional rules:
- For PIEs, the auditor must be on the relevant register and **PIE audits follow a public tender**
  with the auditor approved by the company's highest governing body; rotation rules apply.
- Audit must apply the **International Standards on Auditing (ISA / МСА)** in the Ukrainian
  translation published by the Ministry of Finance.

> **⚠ Verify the precise medium-enterprise audit trigger** against the current consolidated text of
> §2258-VIII for the 2025 reporting year, especially given the threshold changes flagged in
> Section 3. The category that triggers audit (medium/large) depends on which size-threshold set is
> operative. Flag to the reviewer.

## Section 6 — Worked Examples

These illustrate the decision flow. They are **method demonstrations**, not filed returns; every
output requires reviewer sign-off and confirmation of operative thresholds.

### Example 1 — A freelance developer asks "do I file accounts?"

**Facts.** Oksana is a **ФОП**, single-tax group 3, freelance software development, ~₴2.5m income in
2025, no employees.

**Analysis.**
- Oksana is an **individual entrepreneur (ФОП)**, not a legal entity. §996-XIV does not apply to her.
- **She prepares NO financial statements** — no Balance, no Звіт про фінансові результати, no
  Держстат financial report.
- Her obligations: keep an income ledger (ua-bookkeeping) and file the **quarterly single-tax
  declaration** (ua-single-tax). She also pays ЄСВ and the military levy.

**Result.** No financial statements. Redirect to ua-bookkeeping and ua-single-tax. (If she had been
asked whether to incorporate a ТОВ, Section 2's "what changes" note applies.)

### Example 2 — A small ТОВ's first year

**Facts.** A newly registered **ТОВ**, design agency, year-end 31 Dec 2025: assets ≈ €120,000,
net revenue ≈ €410,000, average headcount 6.

**Analysis.**
- A **legal entity** → §996-XIV applies; double-entry accounting and financial statements required.
- Size test (two-of-three): assets €120k ≤ €350k ✓, revenue €410k ≤ €700k ✓, headcount 6 ≤ 10 ✓ —
  meets **all three micro criteria** → **micro-enterprise** (under the §996-XIV set; re-check against
  the №4196-IX set per Section 3).
- Standard: **НП(С)БО 25** → simplified **Форма №1-мс + №2-мс**.
- Audit: micro → **no mandatory audit**.
- Standards framework: **П(С)БО** (not IFRS).

**Result.** Files condensed Форма 1-мс/2-мс with **ДПС by 1 March 2026** and **Держстат by
28 February 2026**. No audit. No publication requirement. *Flag the threshold uncertainty to the
reviewer.*

### Example 3 — A growing ТОВ crosses into "medium"

**Facts.** A logistics **ТОВ**, year-end 31 Dec 2025: assets ≈ €9m, net revenue ≈ €22m, average
headcount 180. Not a financial institution, not a securities issuer.

**Analysis.**
- Legal entity → statements required.
- Size test against §996-XIV: assets €9m (≤ €20m, > €4m), revenue €22m (≤ €40m, > €8m), headcount 180
  (≤ 250, > 50) — exceeds **small** on at least two criteria and sits within **medium** → **medium
  enterprise** (re-confirm under the operative threshold set — Section 3).
- Standard: **НП(С)БО 1** full set (Форми №1–№5) **plus a management report (звіт про управління)**.
  Not in a mandatory-IFRS category, so П(С)БО unless it elects IFRS.
- Audit: medium enterprise → **mandatory statutory audit** under §2258-VIII (subject to the Section 5
  verification note).

**Result.** Full НП(С)БО 1 statements + management report, **audited**, filed with ДПС by 1 March and
Держстат by 28 February, with **publication by 1 June 2026**. *Flag both the size-threshold and the
medium-audit-trigger uncertainty to the reviewer.*

---

## Section 7 — Tier 2 Notes & References

**Tier 2 — practitioner notes (require care and reviewer confirmation):**

- **Threshold conflict (highest priority).** The §996-XIV financial-reporting thresholds and the
  №4196-IX EU-aligned SME thresholds differ. Confirm which governs the report **form** and the
  **audit trigger** for the 2025 reporting year before classifying. This single point drives form
  choice and audit obligation.
- **EUR→UAH conversion.** Apply the **NBU rate at the balance sheet date (31 Dec)**. A company near a
  boundary can change category purely from FX movement — document the rate used.
- **Two-of-three, prior year.** Category is set by meeting two of three criteria, tested on the
  **prior** year's indicators; a company changes category only after the threshold is met, applied
  the following year.
- **Wartime / martial-law caveats.** Filing mechanics, publication, and some deadlines have been
  affected by martial-law measures since 2022. **Verify current-year deadlines and any extensions
  on the ДПС and Держстат portals** before relying on the dates in this skill.
- **XBRL.** PIEs and many entities file via the iXBRL single-window financial-reporting system;
  taxonomy versions change annually.
- **Consolidated statements** for groups and **PIE-specific disclosures** are out of scope here —
  escalate to a credentialed Ukrainian auditor.

## PROHIBITIONS

This skill must NOT be used to:

1. **Prepare or imply that a ФОП (sole proprietor) files formal financial statements.** A ФОП files
   tax declarations and keeps ledgers only. Never produce a Balance Sheet or Держстат financial
   report for an individual entrepreneur.
2. **Assert a definitive size category or audit conclusion without verifying the operative
   thresholds** for the reporting year, given the §996-XIV vs №4196-IX conflict (Sections 3 and 5).
3. **State "no audit required" for a medium, large, PIE or securities-issuer entity** without
   checking every criterion in Section 5.
4. **Apply IFRS to entities not in a mandatory-IFRS category as if compulsory**, or apply national
   П(С)БО to a bank, PIE, large enterprise or other mandatory-IFRS entity.
5. **Use the IASB English IFRS text for statutory statements** where the Ministry of Finance
   Ukrainian translation is required.
6. **Quote deadlines as fixed** without checking ДПС / Держстат for current-year and martial-law
   adjustments.
7. **Sign off, file, or submit** statements, or replace a credentialed Ukrainian accountant or
   auditor. This skill produces drafts and analysis for review only.
8. **Advise on consolidated statements, group reporting, PIE-specific or sector-specific (banking,
   insurance) disclosures** — escalate to a qualified Ukrainian auditor.

## Disclaimer

This skill is **research-verified** open-source content contributed by the Open Accountants
Community. It was prepared from public sources (Law of Ukraine №996-XIV and №2258-VIII, НП(С)БО 1
and 25, ДПС and Держстат guidance, and Big-4 / mid-tier commentary) as of **May 2026** for the 2026
filing of the 2025 reporting year. Several thresholds — in particular the enterprise size criteria
and the medium-enterprise audit trigger — are in transition between the §996-XIV figures and the
EU-aligned №4196-IX criteria and are explicitly flagged as uncertain.

It is **not legal, accounting or tax advice** and does **not** substitute for sign-off by a
**qualified Ukrainian accountant or auditor**. Ukrainian financial-reporting law, standards, forms,
deadlines and martial-law measures change; verify against the current consolidated legislation and
the ДПС / Держstat portals before relying on any figure. Every output produced with this skill must
be reviewed and signed off by a credentialed professional before filing.
