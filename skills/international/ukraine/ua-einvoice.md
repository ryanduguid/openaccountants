# Ukraine Electronic Invoicing & Digital Tax Reporting — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill explains how a Ukrainian self-employed person interacts with the State Tax
Service's digital machinery: issuing and registering the VAT tax invoice (**податкова
накладна**) in the Unified Register (**ЄРПН**), the risk engine that can freeze that
registration (**СМКОР**), the electronic VAT administration system (**СЕА ПДВ**) and its
VAT account, software fiscal receipts (**ПРРО**) for anyone taking money at retail,
qualified electronic signatures (**КЕП**), the taxpayer portal (**Електронний кабінет**),
and where SAF-T UA stands in 2026.

The single most important split: a **non-VAT ФОП** has *light* duties (keep primary
documents, run a ПРРО if they take cash/card retail payments) and **never touches ЄРПН**.
A **VAT-registered taxpayer** carries the *full* electronic burden — tax invoices, ЄРПН
registration deadlines, the СЕА ПДВ VAT account, and exposure to СМКОР blocking.

> **Wartime note.** Martial law has been in force since 24 Feb 2022 and remains in force in
> 2026. Several deadlines below run on the *special martial-law schedule*, which differs
> from the peacetime Tax Code baseline. When martial law ends the peacetime ЄРПН deadlines
> resume. Always confirm the current regime before quoting a date.

### Conservative defaults

When facts are missing, assume the position that **minimises filing risk and penalty
exposure**:

1. **If unsure whether the client is VAT-registered → treat them as a non-VAT ФОП** for
   invoicing (no ЄРПН, no tax invoice) but **flag that VAT status must be confirmed**, because
   if they *are* VAT-registered, missing ЄРПН registration is the costlier error.
2. **Register the tax invoice as early as possible** — never wait for the deadline; the ЄРПН
   penalty clock and the СМКОР blocking risk both grow with delay.
3. **Assume a ПРРО is required** for any cash or card retail settlement unless the client is
   clearly in an exempt category (e.g. Group 1 ФОП within its narrow exemption). Default to
   issuing a fiscal receipt.
4. **Assume the supplier registers the tax invoice**, not the buyer — only the seller can
   register a податкова накладна in ЄРПН.
5. **Treat any "blocked invoice" as urgent** — unblocking has its own deadlines; do not let
   it sit.
6. **Pin amounts and thresholds to 1 January 2026 values** and verify against tax.gov.ua
   before relying on a figure for a filing.

## Section 2 — Who must do what

### A. Non-VAT ФОП (single tax Group 1/2/3 non-VAT, or general-system non-VAT)

A sole proprietor **not registered for VAT** has **no податкова накладна and no ЄРПН
obligations whatsoever**. Their electronic duties are limited to:

- **Primary documents (первинні документи).** Issue and keep invoices/acts (рахунок,
  акт виконаних робіт), contracts, and bank records to substantiate income. A non-VAT
  ФОП's "invoice" is a *commercial* document (рахунок-фактура / invoice), **not** a VAT
  податкова накладна — these are different things and must not be confused.
- **ПРРО fiscal receipts** — required when the ФОП accepts cash or card payments at retail
  (see Section 4). Group 1 ФОП are largely exempt; Groups 2–3 generally must use a ПРРО.
- **Електронний кабінет** for filing the single-tax declaration and viewing obligations,
  accessed with a **КЕП**.

A non-VAT ФОП never registers anything in ЄРПН and is never blocked by СМКОР.

### B. VAT-registered taxpayer (ФОП or company)

A taxpayer registered for VAT (mandatory once taxable supplies exceed **₴1,000,000** over
12 months, or voluntary before that) carries the full electronic load:

- **Issue a податкова накладна** for each taxable supply (and розрахунок коригування /
  adjustment calculation for changes).
- **Register every податкова накладна in ЄРПН** within the statutory deadline (Section 3).
- **Operate within СЕА ПДВ** — the registration limit (∑Накл formula) and the VAT account
  (Section 3).
- **Survive СМКОР** — risk monitoring may suspend (block) registration of an invoice.
- **Run a ПРРО** if also doing retail settlements.
- Authenticate everything with a **КЕП**.

> A Group 3 ФОП may elect the **3% single-tax + VAT** path (vs the 5% non-VAT path). Electing
> VAT pulls the ФОП fully into ЄРПН / СЕА ПДВ / СМКОР. Defer the rate-vs-VAT decision to
> `ua-single-tax`; this skill handles the *mechanics* once VAT-registered.

## Section 3 — Tax invoice (податкова накладна) & ЄРПН registration

### What it is

The **податкова накладна (ПН)** is the VAT document a registered supplier issues for each
taxable supply. It is the buyer's basis for an input-VAT credit (податковий кредит) — but
**only once it is registered in ЄРПН**. An unregistered ПН gives the buyer no credit, so
timely registration is a commercial obligation as much as a tax one.

The **Єдиний реєстр податкових накладних (ЄРПН)** is the single State-Tax-Service register
through which all ПН and розрахунки коригування (РК / adjustment calculations) pass. Only
the **supplier** registers a ПН; the buyer cannot.

### When the ПН arises

By default a ПН is dated to the **first event** — the earlier of (a) payment received or
(b) goods/services supplied (Tax Code Art. 187). The registration deadline runs from that
ПН date.

### Registration deadlines

**Under martial law (the regime in force throughout 2026):**

| ПН/РК dated | Register in ЄРПН by |
|---|---|
| 1st – 15th of the month | **5th** calendar day of the following month |
| 16th – last day of month | **18th** calendar day of the following month |

Registration is temporarily permitted on weekends during martial law (so a deadline falling
on a weekend is *not* pushed forward, and you can register on the day). Verify the current
working/weekend rule before relying on a weekend submission.

**Peacetime Tax Code baseline (resumes when martial law ends):**

| ПН/РК dated | Register in ЄРПН by |
|---|---|
| 1st – 15th of the month | last day of the **same** month |
| 16th – last day of month | **15th** of the following month |

Outer backstop in either regime: ПН/РК cannot be registered later than the relevant maximum
window the Tax Code allows (commonly cited as up to ~365 days for late registration before
the right to register lapses) — *verify* the exact outer limit for the period in question.

### Late-registration penalties

Penalties scale with the length of the delay, broadly **2% up to 25%** of the VAT amount in
the invoice (graduated by days late), with separate (heavier) rules for invoices that are
never registered. Confirm the current banded percentages on tax.gov.ua before quoting them
to a client.

### СЕА ПДВ (electronic VAT administration) and the VAT account

Registration of a ПН in ЄРПН is gated by the **СЕА ПДВ** (Система електронного
адміністрування ПДВ). Each VAT payer has:

- A dedicated **electronic VAT account (електронний ПДВ-рахунок)** opened automatically in
  the Treasury. The payer tops it up; funds there are used to pay VAT liabilities.
- A **registration limit (∑Накл / реєстраційна сума)** — the maximum VAT amount of invoices
  the payer can register at any moment. Simplified, it is built up from the VAT on
  *received* registered invoices plus customs VAT paid plus money lodged on the VAT account,
  minus the VAT on *issued* registered invoices and VAT declared.

If the registration limit is **insufficient**, the system will **not let the supplier
register the ПН** until they top up the VAT account (or until incoming registered invoices
raise the limit). This is a cash-flow trap that catches growing businesses — flag it whenever
a client reports "the system won't register my invoice and it isn't blocked."

### СМКОР — blocking (зупинення реєстрації) of tax invoices

**СМКОР** (Система моніторингу відповідності ПН/РК критеріям оцінки ступеня ризиків;
risk-criteria monitoring system, under CMU Resolution No. 1165) automatically screens each
ПН/РК on submission. If it trips a risk criterion, registration is **suspended (заблокована
/ зупинена)** — the invoice is neither registered nor rejected; it is frozen pending
documentary justification.

Three layers the system checks:

1. **Unconditional-registration criteria** — small/low-risk invoices pass automatically.
2. **Risky-taxpayer status (ризиковий платник)** — if the payer is flagged as risky, its
   invoices block by default. Risk can be inherited (e.g. a new entity with the same
   director/founder/accountant as a flagged one is cross-matched and tagged) and must be
   actively contested.
3. **Risk criteria for the operation** — e.g. **mismatch of input vs output product/service
   codes (УКТ ЗЕД / ДКПП)**: "bought bricks, sold construction services" looks anomalous and
   blocks.

**Pre-empting blocks — the Data Table (Таблиця даних платника).** A payer can file a
**Таблиця даних** declaring its normal input and output codes. Once the tax commission
accepts it, future invoices with those codes are not suspended for that reason — the single
most effective protection against repeat blocking.

**When an invoice is blocked:** the payer files documentary explanations and supporting
documents through the Електронний кабінет; the regional commission decides to register or
refuse within the statutory window. A refusal can be appealed administratively to ДПС and
then in court. Treat every block as time-sensitive — there are deadlines to submit
documents and to appeal.

## Section 4 — ПРРО fiscal receipts (software RRO)

A **ПРРО (програмний реєстратор розрахункових операцій)** is the *software* fiscal cash
register — a free State-provided app (and third-party equivalents) that issues fiscal
receipts and reports settlements to ДПС in real time. It replaced/supplemented the old
hardware РРО.

### Who must use a ПРРО (or РРО)

| Taxpayer | ПРРО / РРО required? |
|---|---|
| **Group 1 ФОП** | **No** — broad exemption, *except* sales of technically complex goods under warranty, medicines/medical devices, jewellery & precious-metal goods |
| **Group 2 ФОП** | **Yes** for cash/card settlement transactions (obligation does not depend on turnover or activity in 2026 — *verify wording for the client's exact activity*) |
| **Group 3 ФОП** | **Yes** for cash/card settlements; also triggered once income passes the РРО threshold |
| **General-system FOP / companies** | **Yes** for cash/card settlements |

A common turnover trigger: a taxpayer must start using a ПРРО/РРО from the quarter after
income exceeds **~220 minimum wages** as of 1 January (≈ **₴1.9 m** for 2026 — *verify the
exact minimum wage and resulting figure*). Certain high-risk goods (jewellery, medicines,
technically complex goods, excisable goods) require a ПРРО **regardless of turnover or
group**.

### Fiscal receipt mechanics

- Issue a **fiscal receipt (фіскальний чек)** in paper or electronic form for every
  settlement. A non-fiscal "sales receipt" does not satisfy the obligation.
- Card payments: the fiscal receipt must follow the bank transaction promptly (commonly cited
  as within ~5–10 minutes). A large gap between the bank transaction and the ПРРО receipt is
  itself a flagged violation.
- Authenticate the ПРРО with a **КЕП**; receipts and the daily Z-report flow to ДПС.

### Penalties

Full (post-moratorium) fines apply in 2026: **100%** of the value of goods/services sold
with a fiscal violation for a first offence and **150%** for each subsequent one. Verify the
current banding before quoting.

> **Important distinction.** The **фіскальний чек** (ПРРО receipt, retail settlement
> evidence) and the **податкова накладна** (VAT document for ЄРПН) are entirely different
> documents serving different systems. A non-VAT ФОП issues fiscal receipts but never a ПН.

## Section 5 — КЕП & Електронний кабінет

### Qualified electronic signature (КЕП)

A **кваліфікований електронний підпис (КЕП)** is the legally binding e-signature used to
sign and submit *everything* electronic to the State — ПН, declarations, ПРРО receipts,
appeals. Options:

- **File-based КЕП** from an accredited provider (наприклад ПриватБанк, Дія, Вчасно, etc.).
- **Дія.Підпис** (Diia mobile signature) — issued free to individuals/ФОП.
- **Cloud КЕП** — stored with a provider, used without a hardware token.
- **BankID / MobileID** for identification (read-level access to some services).

КЕП for individuals/ФОП is commonly obtained **free** via Дія or bank apps (e.g. Privat24).

### Електронний кабінет

The **Електронний кабінет платника** (cabinet.tax.gov.ua) is the ДПС taxpayer portal. It has:

- A **public part** (no login) — registers, forms, calendars, validity checks.
- A **private part** — accessed with a **КЕП** (or Дія.Підпис / cloud КЕП / id.gov.ua),
  where the taxpayer files declarations, registers ПН/ЄРПН, monitors the СЕА ПДВ VAT account
  and registration limit, manages ПРРО, responds to СМКОР blocks, and views liabilities.

Most self-employed e-filing in this skill happens through the Електронний кабінет, signed
with a КЕП.

## Section 6 — SAF-T UA status

**SAF-T UA** (Standard Audit File for Tax — Ukrainian standardised XML accounting file) is
Ukraine's standardised audit-data format, built for the tax authority's e-audit
(електронний аудит) programme.

**Status as of May 2026 — verify before relying:**

- The **general mandatory periodic SAF-T filing rollout was formally withdrawn** (Ministry of
  Finance, mid-2025). The earlier phased plan (large taxpayers from 2025, *all* VAT payers by
  Jan 2027) is **no longer the active mandate**.
- SAF-T UA persists as an **on-demand obligation**: **large taxpayers** must produce the
  SAF-T UA XML file **on request during a tax audit**, not as routine periodic reporting.
- The **e-audit system launched 1 January 2026** uses the SAF-T UA format as its data
  backbone; the current schema is **SAF-T UA 2.0** (simplified structure published late 2024).
- For a **typical self-employed ФОП / small taxpayer, there is no routine SAF-T UA filing
  obligation in 2026.** Small/medium taxpayers were never the immediate target, and the
  blanket "all VAT payers by 2027" requirement has been withdrawn.

> **Flag for the reviewer.** The SAF-T timeline has changed repeatedly. Treat "small taxpayers
> have no SAF-T duty in 2026" as the working position but **confirm against tax.gov.ua / a
> Ukrainian accountant** for any client near the large-taxpayer threshold (₴500 m revenue
> over four quarters) or before advising on 2027.

## Section 7 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Non-VAT Group 3 freelancer (no ЄРПН at all)

*Olena is a Group 3 ФОП on the 5% (non-VAT) path, an IT consultant invoicing a foreign
client.*

- VAT-registered? **No.** → **No податкова накладна, no ЄРПН, no СЕА ПДВ, no СМКОР.**
- She issues a **commercial invoice (рахунок-фактура)** and signs an **акт** with the client;
  she keeps these as primary documents.
- No retail cash/card settlement → arguably **no ПРРО** for this work (bank-to-bank receipts
  for services to a business client). If she ever takes cash from individuals, the ПРРО
  question reopens.
- Files her single-tax declaration through the **Електронний кабінет**, signed with her **КЕП**
  (free via Дія).

**Outcome:** lightest digital footprint — primary documents + e-cabinet + КЕП only.

### Example 2 — VAT-registered Group 3 ФОП issuing and registering a ПН

*Petro is a Group 3 ФОП on the 3% + VAT path. He supplies services on 8 May 2026 for
₴120,000 incl. 20% VAT (₴20,000 VAT).*

- First event = supply on **8 May** → ПН dated 8 May.
- 8 May falls in the **1st–15th** band → register in ЄРПН **by 5 June 2026** (martial-law
  rule).
- Before registering, the system checks his **registration limit (∑Накл)** in СЕА ПДВ. If it
  is below ₴20,000, he must **top up his VAT account** to register.
- He registers via the Електронний кабінет, signed with his **КЕП**. Best practice: register
  the same week, not at the 5 June deadline.

**Outcome:** ПН registered on time; buyer gets input credit; no penalty.

### Example 3 — A blocked invoice (СМКОР)

*Same Petro registers a ПН where the output service code does not match his historical input
codes. СМКОР suspends registration (зупинення реєстрації).*

- The ПН is **frozen**, not rejected. The buyer cannot claim credit yet.
- Petro submits **explanations + supporting documents** through the Електронний кабінет within
  the statutory window; the regional commission decides.
- To prevent recurrence he files a **Таблиця даних платника** listing his normal input/output
  codes; once accepted, future invoices with those codes won't block for that reason.
- If refused, he **appeals** to ДПС and, if needed, to court.

**Outcome:** registration restored after documentary justification; Data Table filed to stop
repeat blocks.

### Example 4 — Group 2 ФОП taking card payments at retail (ПРРО)

*Mariya is a Group 2 ФОП running a small café, non-VAT.*

- Non-VAT → **no ЄРПН/ПН.**
- Cash/card retail settlements → she **must run a ПРРО** and issue a **фіскальний чек** for
  every sale; card receipts must follow the bank transaction promptly.
- ПРРО is signed/operated with her **КЕП**; daily Z-reports flow to ДПС.
- Failure to issue fiscal receipts → **100% / 150%** penalties.

**Outcome:** no VAT machinery, but full ПРРО/fiscal-receipt discipline.

## Section 8 — Tier 2 + Reference + Checklist

### Tier 2 ambiguities (escalate to a credentialed Ukrainian accountant)

- Whether a specific activity/group combination **triggers ПРРО** (the exemptions and
  thresholds have edge cases — high-risk goods override the group exemption).
- The **exact current ЄРПН outer registration window** and the **banded late-registration
  penalty** percentages for the period in question.
- **СМКОР unblocking strategy**, Data Table drafting, and removal from **ризиковий платник**
  status — these are advisory/contentious and often litigated.
- **SAF-T UA** applicability for any client near the large-taxpayer threshold or planning past
  2026.
- The **VAT-vs-non-VAT election** for a Group 3 ФОП (3% vs 5%) — defer to `ua-single-tax`.
- Anything during a **martial-law deadline change** — confirm the live regime.

### Reference

- Tax Code of Ukraine (Податковий кодекс) — Art. 187 (date of liability), Art. 201 (tax
  invoices & ЄРПН).
- CMU Resolution **No. 1165** — СМКОР risk criteria, blocking and Data Table procedure.
- Law **No. 265/95-ВР** on RRO/ПРРО and fiscal receipts.
- State Tax Service — **tax.gov.ua / dps.gov.ua**; portal **cabinet.tax.gov.ua**.
- PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Ukraine (VAT threshold ₴1 m, rate 20%, ЄРПН/СЕА overview).

### Self-employed e-invoicing checklist

- [ ] Confirm **VAT status** — VAT-registered or not? (Determines whether ЄРПН applies at all.)
- [ ] Obtain/renew a **КЕП** (free via Дія / bank) and access the **Електронний кабінет**.
- [ ] **Non-VAT:** issue/keep **primary documents** (рахунок, акт); confirm whether a **ПРРО**
      is required and issue **fiscal receipts** for retail settlements.
- [ ] **VAT-registered:** for each supply, date the **ПН** to the first event and **register
      in ЄРПН** by the deadline (martial-law: 5th / 18th).
- [ ] Monitor the **СЕА ПДВ registration limit (∑Накл)** and **top up the VAT account** before
      registering when needed.
- [ ] File a **Таблиця даних** to pre-empt **СМКОР** blocking; treat any blocked invoice as
      urgent.
- [ ] **Register invoices early**, never at the deadline.
- [ ] Confirm there is **no routine SAF-T UA filing** duty for the client (small taxpayer) —
      flag if near the large-taxpayer threshold.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** issue or "register" a податкова накладна for a **non-VAT** ФОП — they have no ПН
  and no ЄРПН access. Confusing a commercial рахунок-фактура with a VAT податкова накладна is
  a category error.
- **Do NOT** tell a buyer they can register a supplier's tax invoice — **only the supplier**
  registers in ЄРПН.
- **Do NOT** quote ЄРПН registration deadlines without stating which regime (**martial-law**
  vs **peacetime baseline**) applies — they differ and the wrong one causes penalties.
- **Do NOT** state exact late-registration or ПРРО penalty percentages, the ₴ ПРРО turnover
  trigger, or the SAF-T threshold as settled fact without verifying current figures on
  tax.gov.ua — they are pinned to the minimum wage and to changing law.
- **Do NOT** assert that SAF-T UA is mandatory periodic reporting for small taxpayers — as of
  May 2026 it is **on-demand for large taxpayers**; verify before advising past 2026.
- **Do NOT** advise on **СМКОР unblocking, Data Tables, or risky-status removal** as if
  routine — these are advisory/contentious matters for a credentialed practitioner.
- **Do NOT** finalise any filing without **КЕП**-signed submission through the official
  **Електронний кабінет**.
- **Do NOT** treat this skill as a substitute for credentialed review.
