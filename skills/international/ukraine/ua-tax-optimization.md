## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Ukraine (UA) |
| Scope | Legal tax planning / optimization for self-employed individuals |
| Currency | UAH (₴) |
| Taxpayer types | ФОП (фізична особа-підприємець / sole proprietor); Diia City gig-specialist; general-system entrepreneur |
| Key levers | (1) Regime choice — single tax (єдиний податок) Group 3 vs general system (загальна система); (2) ₴1,000,000 VAT threshold; (3) Diia City for IT; (4) ЄСВ at the minimum base; (5) documented expenses on the general system |
| Tax authority | Державна податкова служба (ДПС / State Tax Service) — tax.gov.ua |
| Filing portal | Електронний кабінет платника (cabinet.tax.gov.ua); Diia City portal (city.diia.gov.ua) |
| Contributor | Open Accountants Community |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Ukrainian accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Verified 2026 base figures (pin date: 1 January 2026)

| Figure | 2026 value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum wage (мінімальна зарплата) | ₴8,647/month | Drives ЄСВ and Diia City thresholds — **verify final 2026 minimum wage** in the State Budget law |
| ЄСВ minimum (єдиний соціальний внесок) | ₴1,902.34/month (22% × ₴8,647) | Per FOP and per Diia City specialist |
| Group 3 single tax (non-VAT) | 5% of turnover | |
| Group 3 single tax (VAT-registered) | 3% of turnover + VAT (ПДВ) | |
| Group 3 military levy (військовий збір) | 1% of turnover | In force under martial law; **verify still 1% for Group 3** |
| Group 3 annual income cap | ₴10,091,049 (1,167 × minimum wage) | Recalculated annually |
| General system | 18% PIT + 5% military levy + 22% ЄСВ — all on **net profit** | |
| VAT (ПДВ) registration threshold | ₴1,000,000 taxable supplies over rolling 12 months | See VAT-threshold change note below |
| Diia City gig-specialist | 5% PIT + 5% military levy + ЄСВ 22% of minimum wage | Gig income above €240,000/yr taxed at 18% |

> **Wartime note.** The military levy (військовий збір) rose to 5% for general individuals from
> Dec 2024 and remains in force throughout 2026 under martial law; Group 3 FOPs pay a separate
> fixed 1% military levy on turnover. Fixed amounts (ЄСВ, single tax) are pinned at their
> 1 January value for the whole year. **Verify all rates against tax.gov.ua before relying on them.**

### Conservative defaults

When a planning input is missing or ambiguous, assume the **higher-tax / lower-risk** outcome and
flag it for the reviewer. Specifically:

- Default to the regime the client is **already on** until a break-even analysis clearly favours switching.
- Assume an expense is **non-deductible** on the general system unless it is documented and business-related.
- Assume the client **must** register for VAT once the rolling 12-month figure approaches ₴1,000,000.
- Never assume a relationship qualifies as genuine self-employment if it looks like disguised employment — flag it (Section 7).
- Treat every Diia City figure and the VAT-threshold reform as "verify current value" — both are live policy areas in 2026.

## Section 2 — Choosing the regime (single tax vs general system)

The first and biggest lever for a Ukrainian freelancer is **regime choice**. Most freelancers and
IT contractors serving companies and foreign clients sit on **Group 3 of the single tax** because the
arithmetic is simple and the rate is low. But the general system can win when **documented expenses are
high relative to revenue**.

### The core comparison

| Lever | Group 3 single tax (non-VAT) | General system (загальна система) |
|---|---|---|
| Tax base | Gross **turnover** (revenue received) | **Net profit** (revenue − documented expenses) |
| Headline tax | 5% single tax + 1% military levy = **6% of turnover** | 18% PIT + 5% military levy = **23% of net profit** |
| ЄСВ | ₴1,902.34/month minimum (fixed) | 22% of net profit, but **not less than** ₴1,902.34/month |
| Bookkeeping | Light — income ledger only | Full — income **and** expense documentation |
| Income cap | ₴10,091,049/year | None |
| Activity restrictions | Several activities barred (see ua-single-tax) | None |
| Loss / no-income month | Still owe ЄСВ; single tax/levy track turnover | If no profit, **no PIT/levy** that period (ЄСВ minimum may still apply) |

### Break-even logic

Compare **6% of turnover** (Group 3) against **23% of net profit + ЄСВ delta** (general system).
Group 3's 6% effectively equals 23% of profit when **profit ≈ 26% of turnover** (since
0.06 ÷ 0.23 ≈ 0.26), ignoring the ЄСВ difference.

- **Profit margin above ~26% of turnover → Group 3 (6% of turnover) is cheaper.** This describes
  almost all software developers and freelancers selling labour with few costs — they should
  stay on Group 3.
- **Profit margin below ~26% of turnover → the general system may win**, because you are only
  taxed on the thin slice of profit, not the whole turnover. This describes resellers, agencies
  with large pass-through costs, or businesses with heavy documented purchases.
- **Add the ЄСВ effect.** On the general system ЄСВ is 22% of net profit (floored at the minimum),
  so high-profit businesses on the general system also carry a larger ЄСВ bill — this pushes the
  break-even slightly in Group 3's favour for high earners.

> **Rule of thumb for IT freelancers serving foreign/domestic companies:** Group 3 at 6% is almost
> always the optimum unless turnover is about to breach ₴10,091,049 or VAT/Diia City considerations
> change the picture. Run the actual numbers (Section 6) — never decide on the rule of thumb alone.

Cross-reference **ua-single-tax** for the full Group 1/2/3 rules and activity bars, and
**ua-income-tax** for general-system PIT mechanics and the deductible-expense list.

## Section 3 — The ₴1,000,000 VAT (ПДВ) threshold lever

VAT registration in Ukraine becomes **mandatory** once **taxable supplies exceed ₴1,000,000 over any
rolling 12 calendar months**. For a self-employed person this is a genuine planning lever, because
crossing it changes both the single-tax sub-rate and the compliance burden.

Key points:

- **Group 3 has two sub-rates:** 5% **without** VAT, or 3% **with** VAT registration. The 3% looks
  cheaper but only makes sense if you can reclaim meaningful input VAT (ПДВ кредит) or your clients
  require VAT invoices. A pure-labour freelancer with no input VAT usually keeps the **5% non-VAT**
  status and stays below ₴1,000,000.
- **Foreign-client services may be outside Ukrainian VAT.** Many B2B services exported to
  non-residents are treated as supplied outside Ukraine (place-of-supply rules) and so do **not**
  count toward the threshold and are not subject to Ukrainian VAT. **Verify the place-of-supply
  treatment per service type** — getting this wrong is a common error. See **ukraine-vat**.
- **Monitor the rolling figure**, not the calendar-year figure. Registration is triggered by any
  12-month window.

> **VAT-threshold reform — VERIFY.** Draft legislation in late 2025 proposed making VAT registration
> mandatory for single-tax payers (Groups 1–3) whose taxable operations exceed ₴1,000,000, with
> effect from **1 January 2027** (application by 10 January 2027 for those over the threshold in 2026).
> As of the latest research this was **not yet enacted** and the ₴1,000,000 general threshold remained
> in force for 2026, with a carve-out for single-tax payers. **This is a live policy area — verify
> the current enacted rule on tax.gov.ua before advising anyone, because it materially affects whether
> a Group 3 freelancer must register.**

**Legitimate planning, not avoidance:** managing the threshold means timing genuine business and
choosing the right sub-rate — *not* splitting one real business across multiple FOPs to stay under the
limit. Artificial fragmentation is a red flag (Section 7).

---

## Section 4 — Diia City for IT (eligibility, taxation, trade-offs)

**Diia City** (Дія.Сіті) is a special legal/tax regime for the IT sector. It is not a structure an
individual joins directly — it is a **regime that a resident company joins**, after which the company
can engage specialists as **gig-contract** specialists (ґіг-контракт) or employees with preferential
taxation. It is relevant to a self-employed developer mainly as an **alternative to the FOP model**
when working with (or founding) a Ukrainian IT company.

### Taxation of a Diia City gig-specialist (2026)

| Component | Rate / base |
|---|---|
| Personal income tax (PIT) | **5%** on gig remuneration (vs 18% standard) |
| Military levy (військовий збір) | 5% — applies from the month after the company gains resident status; **verify current rate** |
| ЄСВ | 22% of the **minimum wage** (≈ ₴1,902.34/month), paid by the resident company |
| Gig income cap | Up to **€240,000/year** at the 5% rate; any excess taxed at **18%** (FX rate fixed at 1 January) |

### Resident-company side (the entity, not the individual)

A Diia City resident company chooses between:

- **Corporate income tax (18%)** on net profit, **or**
- **Exit-capital tax (податок на виведений капітал) at 9%** — paid only when profit is *distributed*
  (e.g. dividends); reinvested profit is effectively taxed at 0%.

This makes Diia City attractive for founders who reinvest, and for teams who value the 5% PIT and the
legally-defined gig contract over the FOP model.

### Eligibility (resident company must satisfy all)

1. **≥ 90% of income** from qualified IT activities.
2. **≥ 9 specialists** on average (employees and/or gig-specialists).
3. **Average monthly remuneration ≥ €1,200** equivalent per specialist.

(There are also additional formal requirements and a clean-history test — confirm on city.diia.gov.ua.)

### Trade-offs vs the FOP / Group 3 model

| | Group 3 FOP | Diia City gig-specialist |
|---|---|---|
| Effective tax on labour income | ~6% of turnover (+ fixed ЄСВ) | 5% PIT + 5% levy + ЄSV — usually **higher** than 6% all-in for the individual |
| Who you are | Independent entrepreneur | Engaged by a resident company under a gig contract |
| Income cap | ₴10,091,049 | €240,000 gig (excess at 18%) |
| Setup | Register a FOP | Requires a qualifying resident company |
| Disguised-employment risk | Present if working like an employee for one client | **Lower** — the gig contract is a recognised legal form designed for this |
| Best for | Solo freelancers, multiple clients, low costs | IT teams/companies; founders reinvesting profit; reducing misclassification risk on a single-client relationship |

> **Planning insight.** For a *solo* freelancer with several clients, Group 3 at ~6% is usually
> cheaper than Diia City for the individual. Diia City wins when (a) you are building or joining a
> team/company, (b) you want to convert a single-client FOP relationship into a legally clean form to
> kill misclassification risk, or (c) you reinvest profit and want the 9% exit-capital regime at the
> company level. Compare the **total** burden, not just the headline PIT rate. Cross-read
> **ua-payroll** for the gig/employment payroll mechanics and **ua-formation** for setting up the
> resident company.

---

## Section 5 — ЄСВ and expense levers

### ЄСВ (єдиний соціальний внесок) at the minimum base

- A Group 3 FOP pays ЄСВ at the **minimum** — 22% of the minimum wage, ≈ **₴1,902.34/month** in 2026 —
  regardless of how much they earn. This is already the optimum: there is no legitimate way to pay less
  while remaining covered, and voluntarily paying *more* only raises future pension entitlement.
- **Do not over-pay ЄСВ** unless the client specifically wants higher social/pension cover.
- Certain exemptions exist (e.g. some pensioners, persons with disabilities, FOPs who are also
  employed and have ЄСВ paid by an employer at/above the minimum). **Verify eligibility** — see
  **ua-social-contributions**.
- On the **general system**, ЄСВ is 22% of net profit but **floored at the minimum** and capped at the
  maximum base — another reason high-profit businesses often prefer Group 3's fixed ЄСВ.

### Legitimate expense documentation (general system)

Expenses only reduce tax on the **general system** (Group 3 is taxed on turnover, so expenses are
irrelevant there). To be deductible, an expense must be:

1. **Business-related** (directly connected to the activity that earns the income).
2. **Documented** — primary documents (первинні документи): invoices, acts of acceptance (акти
   виконаних робіт), payment confirmations, contracts.
3. **Recorded** in the FOP's income-and-expense ledger.

Common legitimate deductions: goods/materials for resale, subcontractor and service costs, rent of
business premises, depreciation of business fixed assets, bank fees, software/licences used for the
business. **Personal expenses are never deductible.** Keep all primary documents — the burden of proof
is on the taxpayer at audit. See **ua-income-tax** for the deductible-expense catalogue.

## Section 6 — Worked examples

> Illustrative only, using verified 2026 figures. Round numbers; ignore minor timing. Always
> reproduce with the client's real data and have a Ukrainian accountant confirm.

### Example A — Solo IT freelancer, foreign clients, low costs (Group 3 wins clearly)

- Annual revenue: ₴3,000,000. Documented business expenses: ₴150,000 (≈5% of revenue).
- **Group 3 (non-VAT):** 6% × ₴3,000,000 = **₴180,000** + ЄСВ ₴22,828 = **≈ ₴202,828/year**.
- **General system:** profit = ₴2,850,000; 23% × ₴2,850,000 = ₴655,500 + ЄСВ 22% × ₴2,850,000 (above min)
  = ₴627,000 → **≈ ₴1,282,500/year**.
- **Conclusion:** Group 3 saves ~₴1.08m. Profit margin ~95% → far above the ~26% break-even. **Stay on Group 3.**

### Example B — Reseller / agency, heavy documented costs (general system can win)

- Annual revenue: ₴2,000,000. Documented business expenses: ₴1,700,000 (85% of revenue). Profit margin 15%.
- **Group 3 (non-VAT):** 6% × ₴2,000,000 = **₴120,000** + ЄСВ ₴22,828 = **≈ ₴142,828/year**.
- **General system:** profit = ₴300,000; 23% × ₴300,000 = ₴69,000 + ЄСВ 22% × ₴300,000 = ₴66,000
  → **≈ ₴135,000/year**.
- **Conclusion:** roughly break-even (margin 15% < ~26%); the general system edges ahead and gives
  no income cap. Decide on the **trustworthiness of the expense documentation** and audit risk.

### Example C — Approaching the Group 3 income cap

- Run-rate revenue: ₴11,000,000/year — **above** the ₴10,091,049 Group 3 cap.
- **Issue:** exceeding the cap triggers a penalty rate and forced transition off Group 3 (see ua-single-tax).
- **Legitimate options:** (a) move to the general system (no cap); (b) defer/decline genuine work to
  stay under the cap if commercially sensible; (c) consider a Diia City company structure if this is an
  IT team. **Not legitimate:** splitting one real business across several FOPs to multiply the cap (Section 7).

### Example D — IT founder choosing Diia City vs Group 3

- Developer earning ~₴3,000,000/year and building a small team.
- **As a solo Group 3 FOP:** ~6% (≈ ₴202,828 incl. ЄСВ) — cheapest for the *individual*.
- **As a Diia City gig-specialist:** 5% PIT + 5% military levy on remuneration + ЄСВ — all-in usually
  *higher* than 6% for the individual, **but** the company benefits from the 9% exit-capital regime on
  reinvested profit and the relationship is legally clean (no misclassification risk). **Conclusion:**
  choose Diia City for the *company/team and risk* reasons, not to cut the individual's headline rate.

---

## Section 7 — Risks & red flags (anti-avoidance)

The following are **risks to flag**, not techniques to recommend. If a client's situation matches any
of these, surface it plainly and recommend professional advice — do not design around it.

- **Fictitious / disguised-employment FOP (RISK).** The single most scrutinised arrangement: a company
  pays a worker as a Group 3 FOP to avoid 18% PIT + 5% levy + ~22% ЄСВ payroll cost, while the worker
  in substance functions as an employee (fixed hours, single client, employer's premises/equipment,
  subordination, paid leave). Ukrainian authorities can **reclassify** this, with back taxes, ЄСВ
  arrears, fines and penalties for both sides. **Flag, never advise.** The legitimate alternatives are
  genuine multi-client freelancing, employment, or a **Diia City gig contract** (which exists precisely
  to give a clean legal form for this kind of engagement).
- **Artificial business splitting (RISK).** Dividing one real business across multiple FOPs or family
  members to stay under the Group 3 income cap or the ₴1,000,000 VAT threshold. Treated as abusive.
- **Sham expenses (RISK).** Deducting personal or fabricated costs on the general system. The taxpayer
  bears the burden of proof; undocumented or non-business expenses are disallowed at audit.
- **Mischaracterising VATable supplies (RISK).** Wrongly treating Ukrainian-source supplies as
  out-of-scope to dodge the ₴1,000,000 threshold. Verify place-of-supply per service (ukraine-vat).
- **Ignoring the FX/currency rules (RISK).** Foreign-currency proceeds must be received and converted
  per National Bank of Ukraine (НБУ) currency-control rules; single-tax income is generally recognised
  on the date funds hit the account at the NBU rate. Late or off-channel receipt of foreign earnings
  creates currency-control and tax-timing problems. **Verify current НБУ rules.**
- **Missing the Diia City eligibility tests (RISK).** Falling below the 90%-qualified-income, 9-specialist,
  or €1,200-average thresholds can cost the resident status and the preferential rates.

### FX / foreign-client considerations (legitimate)

- Foreign-client revenue is fine on Group 3 — it counts toward the **₴10,091,049** annual cap at the
  NBU rate on the date received.
- Many exported B2B services fall **outside** Ukrainian VAT (place of supply), so they may not push you
  toward the ₴1,000,000 VAT threshold — **verify per service type**.
- Use proper FOP currency accounts and observe NBU currency-control and mandatory-sale rules where they
  apply. Document every inbound payment.

## Section 8 — Reference

- **Tax Code of Ukraine (Податковий кодекс)** — single tax (Chapter 1, Section XIV), PIT (Section IV),
  military levy, VAT (Section V).
- **State Tax Service of Ukraine (ДПС)** — tax.gov.ua; taxpayer cabinet cabinet.tax.gov.ua.
- **Diia City** — city.diia.gov.ua; the Diia City law and the Tax Code provisions on residents and
  gig contracts.
- **National Bank of Ukraine (НБУ)** — currency-control rules for foreign-currency receipts.
- **Big-4 / professional guidance** — PwC *Worldwide Tax Summaries* (Ukraine), EY, BDO and similar for
  Diia City and general-system mechanics.
- **Companion skills** — `ua-single-tax`, `ua-income-tax`, `ua-payroll`, `ua-formation`,
  `ua-social-contributions`, `ukraine-vat`.

> **Verify-before-advising checklist:** (1) 2026 minimum wage and the resulting ЄСВ figure; (2) whether
> the ₴1,000,000 VAT-threshold reform for single-tax payers has been enacted; (3) current military-levy
> rates for Group 3 and for Diia City specialists; (4) the Group 3 annual income cap; (5) Diia City
> eligibility thresholds and the €240,000 gig cap. All flagged "verify" above.

## PROHIBITIONS

This skill must **never**:

1. Advise, design, or facilitate **tax evasion** of any kind, or any arrangement that conceals income,
   falsifies documents, or misrepresents facts to the ДПС.
2. Recommend or help structure a **fictitious / disguised-employment FOP** relationship, or any sham
   contractor arrangement intended to dodge payroll taxes. Such situations are flagged as RISK only.
3. Recommend **artificial business splitting** across multiple FOPs or persons to defeat the income cap
   or the VAT threshold.
4. Suggest **deducting personal or fabricated expenses**, or backdating/fabricating primary documents.
5. Advise mischaracterising VATable supplies, mishandling foreign-currency receipts outside NBU rules,
   or any breach of currency control.
6. Present any figure as final without the "verify against tax.gov.ua / city.diia.gov.ua" caveat where
   this skill has flagged it.
7. Substitute for a **qualified Ukrainian accountant or tax lawyer**. Every plan requires professional
   sign-off before action.
