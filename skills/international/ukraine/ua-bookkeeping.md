# Ukraine FOP Record-Keeping & Bookkeeping — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill covers how a Ukrainian sole proprietor (ФОП / FOP — фізична особа-підприємець) keeps
records: the income ledger and the income-and-expense ledger, software cash registers (ПРРО /
PRRO), the primary documents that support income and expenses, and how long records must be kept.
It is a **process** skill. For tax groups, rates, income limits, ЄСВ and the military levy, read
**ua-single-tax**; for VAT records, read **ukraine-vat**.

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Ukraine |
| Scope | FOP (фізична особа-підприємець) record-keeping & fiscalisation — single tax & general system |
| Currency | UAH (₴) |
| Primary legislation | Tax Code of Ukraine (Податковий кодекс — ПКУ): Art. 44 (record-keeping & retention), Art. 296 (single-tax records), Art. 177 (general-system records); Law №265/95-ВР "On the use of RRO"; MoF Order №261 of 13.05.2021 (typical ledger form & order) |
| Authority | Державна податкова служба (ДПС / State Tax Service) |
| Portal | Електронний кабінет платника (cabinet.tax.gov.ua) |
| Retention period | Generally **1095 days (3 years)** from the deadline/date of the related filing; longer in defined cases — see Section 6 |
| Contributor | Open Accountants Community |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Ukrainian accountant |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

> **Wartime note:** Martial law suspends the running of statute-of-limitation periods for tax
> audits, which in practice **extends** how long documents should be kept (see Section 6). Treat
> all retention periods as *minimums*. Figures and form references are as of **May 2026**.

### Conservative defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, default to the more cautious record-keeping posture:

1. **Keep a ledger even if not registered.** Registration of ledgers was abolished from 01.01.2021,
   but the *obligation to keep records was not*. Default to maintaining one.
2. **Keep records electronically and back them up.** Default to the Електронний кабінет ledger or
   a structured spreadsheet plus scanned primary documents.
3. **Assume PRRO is required** for any cash or card-acquiring/payment-service sale unless a specific
   exemption clearly applies (Group 1; or genuinely IBAN-to-IBAN-only with no card/PSP).
4. **Keep every primary document**, even where the single tax does not require expense proof —
   income must still be substantiated, and audits are open-ended where none has occurred.
5. **Retain longer, not shorter** — when in doubt about the retention period, keep the document.
6. **Flag, don't guess.** If the FOP group, payment channel, or activity type is unknown, ask;
   the answer changes the PRRO obligation entirely.

## Section 2 — Records by FOP group and system

The record-keeping obligation differs by **system** (single tax vs general system) and, for the
single tax, by **VAT status**. Registration of any ledger with the ДПС is **no longer required**
(abolished 01.01.2021) — but keeping records remains mandatory under Art. 44 ПКУ.

| FOP type | Ledger to keep | What is recorded | Form / format |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Group 1 single tax** (non-VAT) | Книга обліку доходів (income ledger) | Income only | Free form (paper or electronic); typical MoF form optional |
| **Group 2 single tax** (non-VAT) | Книга обліку доходів (income ledger) | Income only | Free form (paper or electronic) |
| **Group 3 single tax, non-VAT** | Книга обліку доходів (income ledger) | Income only | Free form (paper or electronic) |
| **Group 3 single tax, VAT-registered (3% path)** | Книга обліку доходів і витрат (income & expense ledger) | Income **and** expenses | Free form; VAT records additionally per ukraine-vat |
| **General system FOP** | Книга обліку доходів і витрат (income & expense ledger) | Income, expenses, supporting primary documents | Typical form per **MoF Order №261 (13.05.2021)**; paper or electronic |
| **Independent professional activity** (незалежна професійна діяльність — not a FOP, but same regime) | Книга обліку доходів і витрат | Income & expenses | Typical form per MoF Order №261 |

Key distinctions:

- **Single tax (non-VAT) → income only.** Single-tax payers who are not VAT-registered record only
  *income*. They are **not** required to keep an expense ledger, because the single tax is charged
  on turnover, not profit. They must still hold primary documents proving the **origin of goods**
  where applicable and substantiating income.
- **VAT-registered single-tax payers (Group 3, 3% path) → income and expenses.** They keep the
  income-and-expense ledger and the VAT records described in **ukraine-vat**.
- **General system → full income and expenses.** Net taxable income (ПДФО base) is income minus
  documented business expenses, so the income-and-expense ledger and complete primary documents are
  essential. Undocumented expenses are simply disallowed.

> Registration of the ledger in the typical form with the ДПС was **abolished from 1 January 2021**
> for all FOPs. There is no "register the book" step in 2026. The MoF №261 *form* still exists and
> is mandatory in structure for general-system FOPs, but it is **self-maintained**, not filed.

## Section 3 — The income ledger (Книга обліку доходів)

**Who:** Single-tax FOPs (Groups 1–3) who are not VAT-registered.

**What to record (per Art. 296 ПКУ and the historic №261 structure):**

- Date of the entry / day of the transaction.
- Amount of income received that day (cash and non-cash), in UAH.
- For returns/refunds — the amount returned (reduces income).
- Total daily and period income.

**Format and electronic form (2026 position — verified):**

- The ledger may be kept in **paper or electronic** form, in **any convenient format**. There is no
  longer a mandatory standard form and **no registration** with the ДПС.
- Electronic options in practice: (a) the **Книга обліку** facility inside the **Електронний
  кабінет** (cabinet.tax.gov.ua); or (b) a self-built spreadsheet (Excel/Sheets).
- Whichever format is chosen, entries must be reconstructable on demand for an audit.

**When entries are made:**

- Income is recorded **on the day it is received** (cash basis — date funds hit the till or bank
  account). FOPs recognise income when *received*, not when invoiced.
- Foreign-currency income is converted to UAH at the **NBU rate on the date of receipt** (when funds
  are credited to the FOP's account). Keep the bank credit advice as evidence of the rate/date.

> **Verify per case:** the exact line structure depends on the FOP's group and whether they sell
> goods (origin-of-goods documents) versus pure services. The *obligation to record income daily*
> and to keep it electronically-or-on-paper is settled; the *layout* is at the FOP's discretion.

## Section 4 — ПРРО / cash registers (RRO / PRRO)

A **ПРРО (програмний реєстратор розрахункових операцій / software RRO)** is a free, software-based
fiscal cash register that issues fiscal receipts and transmits data to the ДПС in real time. It is
the modern alternative to a hardware RRO and is what almost all FOPs use. The state offers a free
PRRO app; common third-party PRROs include Checkbox, Vchasno.Kasa, and others.

### Who must use RRO/PRRO in 2026

| FOP type | RRO/PRRO obligation (2026) |
|---|---|
| **Group 1 single tax** | **Exempt** — may operate without RRO/PRRO, provided activity stays within "retail trade at markets / household (personal) services to the population." Online sales, delivery, or expanding channels can forfeit the exemption. |
| **Group 2 single tax** | **Mandatory** for settlement operations — cash, payment-card (POS), and payment services (NovaPay, LiqPay, WayForPay, Fondy, etc.). |
| **Group 3 single tax** | **Mandatory** when accepting cash, card or payment-service payments. |
| **General system FOP** | **Mandatory** — no group-based exemption. |

### The IBAN-to-IBAN (pure bank transfer) exemption

A settlement that the buyer makes **directly from their account to the FOP's IBAN** on the basis of
an invoice or contract, **without a payment card and without a payment service/intermediary**, is
**not** treated as a "settlement operation" requiring fiscalisation. Such IBAN→IBAN income needs no
PRRO receipt.

- This is the standard reason a remote/online service FOP (e.g. an IT freelancer paid by SWIFT/IBAN)
  may legitimately operate with **no PRRO**.
- The moment a card, acquiring terminal, or payment service (LiqPay, WayForPay, Fondy, NovaPay, etc.)
  is introduced, the IBAN exemption is **lost** and PRRO becomes required (for Groups 2/3 and general
  system).

### Activities/goods requiring RRO/PRRO regardless of group

Certain sales require RRO/PRRO **irrespective of single-tax group** (i.e. even some Group 1/low-turnover
arguments fail). Verify the current list against Art. 296.10 ПКУ and Law №265, but it generally
includes:

- **Technically complex household goods subject to warranty** (технічно складні побутові товари).
- **Medicines, medical products and medical devices.**
- **Jewellery and articles of precious metals / precious & semi-precious stones.**
- **Excisable goods** (alcohol, tobacco, fuel) where sold by the FOP.

### How a PRRO works (process)

1. FOP registers the PRRO (the cash register unit and its cashiers) in the **Електронний кабінет**.
2. At each cash/card/PSP sale, the FOP creates a **fiscal receipt** in the PRRO app.
3. The receipt is **transmitted to the ДПС fiscal server** in real time; offline mode is permitted
   for a limited time/number of receipts when connectivity fails, then synced.
4. A **Z-report** is generated at end of shift; the **X-report** shows current totals.
5. Fiscal receipts/Z-reports become part of the FOP's records and feed the income ledger.

> **Penalties (verify amounts):** failure to issue a fiscal receipt where required is penalised at
> **100% of the value** of the goods/service on first violation and **150%** on subsequent ones
> (regime effective from mid-2025). Flag exposure but do not state penalty figures as certain
> without confirming the current law.

## Section 5 — Primary documents (первинні документи)

Primary documents substantiate every figure in the ledgers. Even single-tax (non-VAT) FOPs, who
keep no expense ledger, must hold documents proving **income** and the **origin of goods** sold.

**Income-side documents:**

- **Invoice (рахунок-фактура / рахунок).** Can serve as a primary document at the moment of payment
  if it carries the required requisites.
- **Act of completed works/services (акт виконаних робіт / наданих послуг).** Confirms that work
  was completed and accepted by the client — the core service-FOP document.
- **Contract (договір)** with the client (especially for IBAN-to-IBAN income, to evidence the
  basis of payment and support the no-PRRO position).
- **Fiscal receipts / Z-reports** from the PRRO (for cash/card/PSP sales).
- **Bank statements (банківські виписки)** showing funds received — the primary evidence of income
  date and amount for non-cash receipts.

**Expense-side documents (general system, and VAT-registered Group 3):**

- Supplier invoices, **видаткові накладні** (delivery notes), acts of works/services received.
- Cash documents, bank payment confirmations.
- Documents must show a **direct link to obtaining business income** to be deductible (Art. 177 ПКУ).

**Cash vs bank receipts:**

- **Cash sales** → require a **PRRO fiscal receipt** (unless the FOP is a Group 1 exempt operator).
- **Bank/non-cash receipts** → evidenced by **bank statements**; PRRO required only if a card or
  payment service was involved (not pure IBAN→IBAN).

**FX / foreign-currency conversion evidence:**

- Foreign income (common for IT freelancers) is converted to UAH at the **NBU exchange rate on the
  date the funds are credited**.
- Keep the **bank credit advice / SWIFT confirmation** and the bank statement showing the conversion
  and crediting date. These evidence both the income amount and the applied rate.
- Note Ukraine's currency-control rules require export-service proceeds to be repatriated within the
  prescribed period (verify current NBU term) — keep the contract and inbound-payment evidence to
  satisfy the bank/NBU as well as the ДПС.

## Section 6 — Retention & audit readiness

**General rule (Art. 44.3 ПКУ):** keep primary documents, ledgers, and related records for **at
least 1095 days (3 years)**, counted from the **deadline for filing** the related tax report (or
from the date of actual filing if later) for which the documents were used.

**Longer in defined cases (verify the exact category):**

- **1825 days (5 years)** — e.g. documents relating to payments to non-residents with
  Ukrainian-source income (and certain simplified-system legal-entity records).
- **2555 days (7 years)** — transfer-pricing and controlled-foreign-company documentation.

**The "no audit yet" trap:** if the ДПС has **never conducted a documentary audit** of the FOP, the
taxpayer must, in practice, retain primary documents **until such an audit takes place** — even
beyond 1095 days. Do not advise destroying documents merely because three years have elapsed.

**Wartime extension:** under martial law the running of audit limitation periods is suspended, so the
effective retention horizon is **longer than 1095 days** for periods falling within the suspension.
Default to keeping everything.

**Audit-readiness checklist:**

- Ledger maintained and reconstructable (electronic copy + backup).
- Primary documents organised by period and matched to ledger entries.
- Bank statements reconciled to recorded income.
- PRRO Z-reports retained and tied to cash/card income.
- FX credit advices retained for foreign income.
- Origin-of-goods documents retained where goods are sold.

## Section 7 — Worked Examples

### Example A — Group 3 single-tax IT freelancer (non-VAT), paid by IBAN

- **Facts:** Develops software for foreign clients, paid in USD/EUR to the FOP's foreign-currency
  account, no card/PSP, no cash.
- **Ledger:** Книга обліку доходів (income ledger only) — non-VAT single tax.
- **PRRO:** **Not required** — payments are IBAN→IBAN with no card or payment service.
- **Records:** Service contract; act of completed works (or equivalent); bank statement + SWIFT/credit
  advice showing the UAH-converted amount and crediting date (NBU rate on receipt date).
- **Entry timing:** Record income in UAH on the date funds are credited.
- **Retention:** ≥ 1095 days from each annual declaration deadline; keep longer (no audit yet /
  wartime suspension).

### Example B — Group 2 single-tax with cash sales (small café/services to individuals)

- **Facts:** Accepts cash and POS-card payments from walk-in customers.
- **Ledger:** Книга обліку доходів (income ledger only) — non-VAT single tax.
- **PRRO:** **Mandatory** — cash and card settlement operations. Register a PRRO in the Електронний
  кабінет; issue a fiscal receipt for every sale; generate Z-reports per shift.
- **Records:** Daily Z-reports feed the income ledger; origin-of-goods documents for resold items;
  bank statements for card settlements.
- **Retention:** ≥ 1095 days; longer per Section 6.

### Example C — General-system FOP (consulting + resale of equipment)

- **Facts:** On the general system; income taxed on net profit; mix of bank and card income.
- **Ledger:** Книга обліку доходів і витрат (income-and-expense ledger) in the **MoF №261** typical
  form — paper or electronic; **not registered** with the ДПС.
- **PRRO:** **Mandatory** for cash/card/PSP sales; IBAN→IBAN-only receipts would be exempt.
- **Records:** Full expense documentation (supplier invoices, видаткові накладні, acts of services
  received), bank statements, PRRO receipts, contracts. Undocumented expenses are disallowed for
  ПДФО.
- **Retention:** ≥ 1095 days; resale/origin-of-goods and any non-resident-payment documents may need
  longer.

### Example D — Group 1 single-tax market trader

- **Facts:** Retail trade at a market; sales to individuals only; within Group 1 limits.
- **Ledger:** Книга обліку доходів (income ledger only).
- **PRRO:** **Exempt** while activity stays within "retail at markets / household services." Selling
  online or via delivery, or selling listed goods (technically complex goods, jewellery, medicines,
  excisable goods), would **trigger** a PRRO obligation.
- **Records:** Daily income recorded in the ledger; origin-of-goods documents where required.

## Section 8 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

Flag these to a credentialed Ukrainian accountant rather than deciding unilaterally:

1. **Whether a payment channel is "IBAN-to-IBAN".** Whether a specific PSP/marketplace flow counts
   as a card/payment-service settlement (PRRO required) or a pure bank transfer (exempt) is
   fact-specific; transfer codes (e.g. 2924, 2650, 2654) and intermediary involvement matter.
2. **Group 1 "format" boundary.** Whether a Group 1 trader's activity has strayed beyond "markets /
   household services" (e.g. social-media or delivery sales) and lost the PRRO exemption.
3. **Listed-goods triggers.** Whether goods sold fall within the technically-complex /
   jewellery / medicines / excisable categories that mandate PRRO regardless of group.
4. **Origin-of-goods documentation** sufficiency for goods-selling single-tax FOPs.
5. **Expense deductibility** on the general system — the "direct link to income" test under Art. 177.
6. **Retention beyond 1095 days** — non-resident payments, controlled transactions, depreciable
   assets, and the wartime suspension's effect on each period.
7. **FX recognition date and NBU rate** application where banking dates and value dates differ.
8. **Single-tax limit breach** consequences for records (re-classification, retroactive PRRO duty)
   — coordinate with **ua-single-tax**.

## Section 9 — Reference Material + checklist

**Legislation & sources (verify current text):**

- Tax Code of Ukraine (ПКУ): **Art. 44** (record-keeping, retention, 1095/1825/2555-day rules);
  **Art. 296** (single-tax records, 296.10 RRO exemption); **Art. 177** (general-system income/expense).
- **Law №265/95-ВР** "On the use of registrars of settlement operations" (RRO/PRRO).
- **MoF Order №261 of 13.05.2021** — typical form & order for the income-and-expense ledger
  (general system / independent professional activity); abolition of mandatory standard single-tax
  book and of ledger registration from 01.01.2021.
- Державна податкова служба — tax.gov.ua / dps.gov.ua; **Електронний кабінет** cabinet.tax.gov.ua.

**Quick checklist for a FOP's books:**

- [ ] Correct ledger for the system/group (income only vs income-and-expense).
- [ ] Ledger kept (paper or electronic) — backed up; **no registration needed**.
- [ ] Income recorded on the date of receipt; FX converted at NBU rate on credit date.
- [ ] PRRO registered and used for all cash/card/PSP sales (unless Group 1 exempt or pure IBAN→IBAN).
- [ ] Fiscal receipts issued; Z-reports retained.
- [ ] Primary documents on file: contracts, invoices, acts of works, bank statements, credit advices.
- [ ] Origin-of-goods documents where goods are sold.
- [ ] Documents retained ≥ 1095 days (longer where rules or wartime suspension apply).

## PROHIBITIONS

- Do **not** state that ledgers must be registered with the ДПС — registration was **abolished from
  01.01.2021**. Only assert the keeping obligation.
- Do **not** tell a FOP they need no PRRO without confirming the payment channel — only Group 1
  (within format) and genuinely card-/PSP-free IBAN→IBAN flows are exempt.
- Do **not** advise destroying documents at 1095 days where no audit has occurred or where the
  wartime suspension or a longer category applies.
- Do **not** treat a single-tax (non-VAT) FOP as needing an expense ledger — income only — but never
  imply they can discard income/origin-of-goods evidence.
- Do **not** quote penalty amounts or specific NBU repatriation terms as settled without verifying
  current law.
- Do **not** compute tax, rates, ЄСВ, the military levy, or VAT here — defer to **ua-single-tax**
  and **ukraine-vat**.
- Do **not** advise on company (TOV) accounting — this skill is FOP-only.
