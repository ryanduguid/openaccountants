  single tax. Trigger on phrases like "загальна система", "general system Ukraine",
  "18% income tax Ukraine self-employed", "ПДФО ФОП", "декларація про майновий стан і доходи",
  "FOP general taxation", "net profit tax Ukraine freelancer", "Ukraine self-employed expenses
  deduction", or any question where a Ukrainian FOP is taxed on net business profit at 18% PIT
  plus the 5% military levy and is allowed to deduct documented business expenses. For the
  simplified turnover-based regime use ua-single-tax instead; for ЄСВ use ua-social-contributions.

# Ukraine General-System Personal Income Tax (ПДФО for FOP / Загальна система) — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill covers a Ukrainian sole proprietor (ФОП / фізична особа-підприємець) taxed on the
**general system** — net business **profit** taxed at **18% personal income tax (ПДФО)** plus a
**5% military levy (військовий збір)**, with **documented business expenses deductible**. This is
fundamentally different from the simplified єдиний податок (turnover-based, no expense deduction)
— for that, use **ua-single-tax**. Unified social contribution (ЄСВ) is handled by
**ua-social-contributions** and only referenced here.

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Ukraine |
| Regime | Загальна система оподаткування (General taxation system) for ФОП |
| Tax | ПДФО (personal income tax) + військовий збір (military levy) on net business profit |
| Taxpayer | ФОП (фізична особа-підприємець) — self-employed sole proprietor, Ukrainian resident |
| Currency | UAH (₴) |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec) |
| Primary legislation | Tax Code of Ukraine (Податковий кодекс України) — Art. 177 (FOP general system), Section IV (ПДФО), Art. 16¹ subsection 10 of the Transitional Provisions (military levy) |

| Skill version | 1.0 |

> **Wartime note:** Under martial law the military levy rose from 1.5% to **5%** effective **1 Dec 2024** and remains 5% throughout **2026**. It reverts to 1.5% in the year **after** martial law ends — verify the current status with the ДПС before relying on the rate. Figures below are as of **1 January 2026**.

### Rate table (general system, 2026)

| Component | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| ПДФО (personal income tax) | **18%** | Net taxable profit = income − documented allowable expenses |
| Військовий збір (military levy) | **5%** | Same net profit base; computed under Art. 177 rules (Tax Code §16¹.10 Transitional Provisions) |
| **Combined income-tax burden** | **23%** | of net profit |
| ЄСВ (unified social contribution) | 22% of net profit, min 22% of min. wage | See **ua-social-contributions** |
| VAT (ПДВ) | 20% standard | Mandatory registration if 12-month turnover > ₴1,000,000 — see **ukraine-vat** |

### Key 2026 amounts (as of 1 Jan 2026; verify current values)

| Item | Value | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum wage (мінімальна зарплата) | ₴8,647 / month | Set 1 Jan 2026 |
| Living wage, working-age (прожитковий мінімум) | ₴3,328 / month | Set 1 Jan 2026 |
| ЄСВ minimum | ₴1,902.34 / month (22% × ₴8,647) | See ua-social-contributions |
| ЄСВ maximum monthly base | 20 × min. wage = ₴172,940 | Cap on the 22% base |
| Asset threshold for "fixed asset" (ОЗ) | > ₴20,000 and useful life ≥ 1 year | Art. 177.4.6 ПКУ; below = expensed immediately |
| VAT registration threshold | ₴1,000,000 turnover / 12 months | Art. 181 ПКУ |

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Regime not stated, but expenses are claimed / income exceeds single-tax cap | General system (this skill) |
| Regime not stated, freelancer with low costs | Likely single tax → route to ua-single-tax and confirm |
| Expense lacks a supporting document | NOT deductible — exclude and flag |
| Personal-vs-business split unclear | Treat as non-deductible (personal) unless a documented business apportionment exists |
| Fixed asset vs immediate expense unclear | If cost > ₴20,000 and life ≥ 1 yr → capitalise & depreciate (straight-line); else expense |
| Foreign-currency receipt date | NBU rate on the date funds are received (cash basis) |
| Military levy rate | 5% (martial law in force in 2026) — verify before filing |
| Whether ЄСВ applies | Assume YES; minimum ₴1,902.34/month even at a loss — confirm in ua-social-contributions |

---

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs
- **Minimum:** confirmation the FOP is on the **general system**; full-year bank statements for all business accounts (UAH and FX); list of business expenses **with supporting documents**.
- **Recommended:** Книга обліку доходів і витрат (income & expense ledger), registration extract (виписка з ЄДР) with КВЕД activity codes, prior-year declaration, ЄСВ payment history, fixed-asset register.
- **Ideal:** all primary documents (invoices/акти, видаткові накладні, bank confirmations, FX conversion records at NBU rate), depreciation schedule, evidence of advance payments made.

### Refusal catalogue
- **R-UA-1 — Company / legal entity (ТОВ, ПП).** This skill is for an individual ФОП on the general system only. A company pays corporate income tax (податок на прибуток підприємств, 18%) under different rules. Escalate / route to a corporate skill.
- **R-UA-2 — Non-resident.** General-system ФОП taxation here assumes a Ukrainian tax resident. Non-residents have different rules and registration constraints. Escalate.
- **R-UA-3 — Employment / civil-contract income only.** Salary, gig income paid by an employer/agent under PAYE-style withholding, and ordinary citizen income (not entrepreneurial) are taxed differently (withheld at source or via the personal declaration as non-business income). Out of scope for the FOP business-profit computation. Route to a personal-income skill.
- **R-UA-4 — Independent professional (особа, яка провадить незалежну професійну діяльність).** Notaries, lawyers, arbitration managers, etc. (Art. 178 ПКУ) are taxed similarly but under a separate article with their own nuances. Flag — do not silently apply Art. 177.
- **R-UA-5 — Single-tax (єдиний податок) payer.** Turnover-based, no expense deduction. Wrong skill → route to **ua-single-tax**.
- **R-UA-6 — Excisable / restricted activity questions, gambling, financial intermediation.** May require special licensing/excise treatment beyond ПДФО. Flag for a specialist.

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

Cash basis: income is recognised when funds are **received**; an expense is deductible only when **paid AND documented AND** the related income is received (matching under Art. 177.2/177.4). Ukrainian + English keywords below are indicative — confirm against the underlying document.

### Income patterns (taxable revenue)

| Bank-statement keyword (UA / EN) | Treatment |
|---|---|
| "оплата за послуги", "за виконані роботи", "payment for services", "invoice 123" | Business income — include in revenue |
| "аванс за товар/послуги", "advance / prepayment" | Income on receipt (cash basis) — include |
| "надходження від клієнта", "from client", PayPal/Wise/Payoneer settlement to FOP account | Business income — convert FX at NBU rate on receipt date |
| "експортна виручка", "export proceeds", USD/EUR inflow | Foreign business income — include at NBU rate on receipt |
| "повернення переплати від постачальника" (supplier refund of overpayment) | Reduces the related expense, not income — net off |

### Deductible expense patterns (documented business expenses — Art. 177.4)

| Bank-statement keyword (UA / EN) | Treatment |
|---|---|
| "закупівля товару/сировини", "за матеріали", "purchase of goods / raw materials" | Cost of goods/materials — deductible **only against income from their sale** (Art. 177.4.1) |
| "оренда офісу/приміщення", "rent", "оренда обладнання" | Rent of premises/equipment used in business — deductible |
| "комунальні послуги" (utilities, business premises) | Deductible to the business-use extent |
| "зарплата найманим", "ЄСВ за працівників", "wages / payroll / USC on employees" | Wages and the employer ЄСВ on employees — deductible (Art. 177.4.2) |
| "послуги зв'язку / інтернет", "telecom / internet" | Deductible if business-related |
| "банківські комісії", "РКО", "bank service fees" | Deductible bank charges |
| "транспортні / логістика / доставка", "freight / delivery" | Deductible if business-related |
| "придбання ОЗ" > ₴20,000 (fixed asset purchase) | **Capitalise & depreciate** straight-line (Art. 177.4.6–.7) — NOT a full immediate expense |
| "ремонт обладнання (поточний)", "current repair" | Current repairs deductible immediately; improvements/modernisation are capitalised |
| "обов'язкове страхування", "mandatory insurance" of business assets | Deductible (mandatory insurance only) |
| "сплата єдиного внеску ФОП за себе" (own ЄСВ) | Deductible as a business expense per Art. 177.4 sub-rules (own ЄСВ) — confirm current ДПС position |

### Non-deductible patterns (exclude from expenses)

| Pattern | Why |
|---|---|
| Expense with **no supporting document** (act/invoice/receipt) | Not deductible — documentation is mandatory (Art. 177.4) |
| Personal / household spending, family, groceries, personal car for private use | Not business-related |
| Purchase of land, residential real estate (Art. 177.4.5 exclusions) | Excluded from FOP expenses |
| ПДФО, military levy, and the FOP's own income tax payments | Taxes on profit are not deductible against profit |
| Fines, penalties, late-payment interest (penya) | Not deductible |
| Cost of goods still in inventory / not yet sold | Deductible only in the period the matching income is received |
| Dividends, gifts, charitable transfers (unless within allowed limits) | Not a business expense |

### Internal transfers / exclusions (not income, not expense)

| Pattern | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Transfer between the FOP's own accounts ("переказ між власними рахунками") | Internal — exclude both legs |
| Withdrawal of own funds for personal use ("на власні потреби", "self-transfer to personal card") | Not an expense — owner drawing; exclude |
| Loan principal received / repaid ("кредит", "позика", "тіло кредиту") | Financing, not income/expense — exclude principal (interest may be deductible if business) |
| FX conversion between own accounts | Exclude; record only the UAH value of the underlying receipt |
| VAT collected/paid (if VAT-registered) | Handled in the VAT return, not in the profit computation — see ukraine-vat |

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

**Example 1 — IT consultant, general system, foreign client.**
Receives USD 50,000 over the year (NBU rates on each receipt average ≈ ₴41.5 → ₴2,075,000 income).
Documented expenses: subcontractor акти ₴400,000, software subscriptions ₴60,000, rent ₴120,000, bank fees ₴15,000, own ЄСВ ₴22,828.
Net profit ≈ 2,075,000 − 617,828 = **₴1,457,172**.
ПДФО 18% = ₴262,291; military levy 5% = ₴72,859. Combined income tax ≈ **₴335,150** (plus ЄСВ separately).
Note: turnover ₴2.075m exceeds ₴1m → check mandatory VAT registration (ukraine-vat).

**Example 2 — Retailer, cost-of-goods matching.**
Buys goods for ₴300,000 in December 2025, sells half in 2025 and half in 2026.
Only the cost of goods **actually sold** in 2025 (₴150,000) is deductible against 2025 income; the remaining ₴150,000 is deductible in 2026 when the matching sale revenue is received (Art. 177.4.1 matching rule).

**Example 3 — Loss year.**
Income ₴200,000; documented expenses ₴260,000 → negative result. No ПДФО and no military levy on business profit (there is no positive base). **ЄСВ is still due** at the minimum ₴1,902.34/month (₴22,828.08/year) regardless of the loss (see ua-social-contributions). A negative result does not carry forward as a deduction to the next year for FOPs.

**Example 4 — Fixed asset purchase.**
Buys a laptop for ₴45,000 (> ₴20,000, useful life ≥ 1 yr). Not a full immediate expense. Capitalise and depreciate straight-line over its useful life (e.g. 2 years → ₴22,500/year) per Art. 177.4.6–.7. A ₴12,000 phone (< ₴20,000) is expensed immediately as a low-value item (МНМА).

**Example 5 — Advance payments vs final settlement.**
A FOP self-calculates PIT advances from actual H1 results: pays by 20 April (Q1), 20 July (Q2), 20 October (Q3). The military levy and the Q4 portion are settled in the annual declaration. Final reconciliation (top-up) is paid within 10 days after the 1 May filing deadline.

**Example 6 — Mixed personal/business car.**
Fuel and maintenance for a car used 70% business / 30% personal: only the business portion is deductible, and only with proper documentation and a defensible apportionment basis. Without documentation → exclude entirely (Tier 2 judgement — see Section 6).

---

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (clear rules with Tax Code references)

1. **Tax object = net profit.** Object of taxation is net taxable income = total income received in cash/in-kind minus documented business expenses (Art. 177.2 ПКУ).
2. **ПДФО rate 18%** on net profit (Art. 167.1 ПКУ).
3. **Military levy 5%** on the same net-profit base, computed under the Art. 177 procedure (Transitional Provisions §16¹.10; raised to 5% from 1 Dec 2024; reverts to 1.5% after martial law ends).
4. **Cash basis.** Income is recognised when received; expenses when paid and documented (Art. 177.2, 177.4).
5. **Documentation mandatory.** Only documented expenses directly related to the business are deductible; the list of allowable expenses is in Art. 177.4 ПКУ.
6. **Cost-of-goods matching.** Cost of goods/materials is deductible in the period the income from selling them is received (Art. 177.4.1).
7. **Fixed assets.** Items > ₴20,000 with life ≥ 1 year are capitalised and depreciated straight-line over their useful life (Art. 177.4.6–.7). Current repairs are expensed; modernisation/improvement is capitalised. Land and residential property are excluded (Art. 177.4.5).
8. **Quarterly PIT advances.** Self-calculated from actual income/expense records; due by **20 April, 20 July, 20 October**. No separate Q4 advance — Q4 is settled in the declaration (Art. 177.5.1).
9. **Annual declaration** "про майновий стан і доходи" filed by **1 May** of the following year (Art. 177.5, 49.18.5).
10. **Final payment** within **10 calendar days** after the filing deadline (Art. 177.5.1, 57.1).
11. **ЄСВ separate.** Unified social contribution (22% of net profit, min ₴1,902.34/month) is computed and paid separately — see **ua-social-contributions** and Law No. 2464-VII.
12. **VAT.** Mandatory registration once 12-month taxable turnover exceeds ₴1,000,000 (Art. 181 ПКУ); voluntary registration possible — see **ukraine-vat**.

---

## Section 6 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement)

- **Mixed-use assets (car, phone, home office):** apportionment between business and personal use requires a defensible basis and documentation. Conservative default = exclude the personal portion; if no basis exists, exclude entirely.
- **Own ЄСВ deductibility:** the FOP's own unified social contribution treatment in expenses has shifted with legislative amendments — confirm the current-year ДПС position before deducting.
- **Subcontractor payments to other FOPs/individuals:** deductible if documented (акт виконаних робіт), but verify withholding/ЄСВ obligations if the payee is an ordinary individual rather than a registered FOP.
- **Inventory at year-end:** the matching rule means unsold-goods cost is carried, not expensed. Requires a stock count and judgement.
- **Currency-conversion timing and rate:** which NBU rate (receipt date vs sale date) and treatment of FX gains/losses on business accounts — reviewer to confirm.
- **Depreciation useful lives:** the FOP chooses useful life within reason; document and apply consistently.
- **Transition between regimes** (single tax ↔ general system mid-year): pro-rating, double-counting risks, and treatment of assets bought under the prior regime — escalate.
- **Whether an item is a "current repair" or a capitalisable "improvement":** judgement call affecting timing of the deduction.

## Section 8 — Bank Statement Reading Guide (Ukrainian banks)

Most FOPs bank with **PrivatStudio/Privat24 для бізнесу (PrivatBank)**, **Monobank (sole-trader / "ФОП" account)**, **Oschadbank**, or **Raiffeisen Bank**. Export the business-account statement (виписка) for the full year; for FX accounts also export the conversion records.

| Ukrainian term | English | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Виписка по рахунку | Account statement | The primary source document |
| Надходження / Кредит | Credit / money in | Candidate income |
| Списання / Дебет | Debit / money out | Candidate expense |
| Призначення платежу | Payment purpose / narrative | Read this to classify |
| РКО / комісія банку | Account servicing / bank fee | Deductible |
| Поточний рахунок ФОП | FOP current account | Business account |
| Валютний рахунок | FX account | Convert at NBU rate on receipt |
| Переказ на власну картку | Transfer to own card | Owner drawing — exclude |
| Еквайринг / торговий POS | Acquiring / card-terminal settlement | Sales income (gross of acquiring fee) |
| Поповнення рахунку готівкою | Cash deposit | Verify source before treating as income |

Bank-specific notes:
- **Monobank ФОП:** statement downloadable as CSV/PDF in the app; "Покупки/Перекази" tags are not tax categories — reclassify by narrative.
- **PrivatBank (Privat24 Бізнес):** "виписка" with "Призначення платежу" column; acquiring settlements arrive net of fee — gross up the income and book the acquiring fee as an expense.
- **Oschadbank / Raiffeisen:** check whether VAT is shown separately on settlements if the FOP is VAT-registered.
- **Always reconcile** the bank total to the Книга обліку доходів і витрат (income & expense ledger); cash receipts not in the bank must still be declared.

## Section 9 — Onboarding Fallback (questions to ask)

1. Are you registered as a ФОП on the **general system**, or on the **single tax** (єдиний податок)? (If single tax → ua-single-tax.)
2. What are your КВЕД activity codes?
3. Are you **VAT-registered** (платник ПДВ)? Did 12-month turnover exceed ₴1,000,000?
4. Do you have **supporting documents** (акти, invoices, receipts) for the expenses you want to deduct?
5. Do you have employees? (Affects wages/ЄСВ deductions and reporting.)
6. Did you buy any **fixed assets** (> ₴20,000) this year? Do you keep a depreciation schedule?
7. Did you receive **foreign-currency** income? Do you have NBU conversion records?
8. Did you make the **quarterly PIT advances** (20 Apr / 20 Jul / 20 Oct)? How much?
9. Are you paying your own **ЄСВ**? (Confirm in ua-social-contributions.)
10. Any inventory unsold at year-end? (Affects cost-of-goods matching.)

## Section 10 — Reference Material

### Legislation
- **Tax Code of Ukraine (Податковий кодекс України)** — **Art. 177** (taxation of FOP income on the general system: object, expenses, advances, declaration), **Art. 178** (independent professional activity — out of scope), **Section IV / Art. 167.1** (18% PIT rate), **Art. 181** (VAT registration threshold), **Art. 49.18.5 & 57.1** (filing/payment deadlines), **Transitional Provisions §16¹.10** (military levy, 5% under martial law).
- **Law No. 2464-VI "Про збір та облік єдиного внеску…"** — ЄСВ (handled in ua-social-contributions).
- **Law No. 4015-IX / No. 4113-IX (2024)** — military-levy increase to 5% from 1 Dec 2024 and FOP application rules.
- State Tax Service: **tax.gov.ua / dps.gov.ua**; portal **cabinet.tax.gov.ua**.
- PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Ukraine (Individual).

### Short test suite
- *FOP on general system, income ₴1m, documented expenses ₴300k* → net profit ₴700k; ПДФО ₴126k + military levy ₴35k = ₴161k (+ ЄСВ separate). ✔
- *Expense with no document* → not deductible; exclude. ✔
- *Laptop ₴45,000* → capitalise & depreciate, not full expense. ✔
- *Loss year* → no PIT/military levy on profit; ЄСВ still ₴1,902.34/month. ✔
- *Single-tax payer asks to deduct expenses* → wrong skill; route to ua-single-tax. ✔
- *Turnover ₴1.5m* → flag mandatory VAT registration (> ₴1m). ✔
- *Transfer to own personal card* → owner drawing; exclude, not an expense. ✔

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER deduct an expense without a supporting document — documentation is mandatory under Art. 177.4.
- NEVER deduct the cost of goods still unsold at year-end — apply the cost-of-goods matching rule.
- NEVER expense a fixed asset (> ₴20,000, life ≥ 1 yr) in full — capitalise and depreciate straight-line.
- NEVER deduct personal/household spending, land, residential property, fines, penalties, or the FOP's own income tax.
- NEVER use the 1.5% military-levy rate for 2026 — it is **5%** under martial law (verify current status before filing).
- NEVER omit ЄСВ — it is due (min ₴1,902.34/month) even in a loss year; compute it via ua-social-contributions.
- NEVER apply single-tax (turnover-based) logic here — the general system taxes net profit; route turnover cases to ua-single-tax.
- NEVER treat owner drawings or transfers between the FOP's own accounts as income or expense.
- NEVER present a computed figure as final — every output must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Ukrainian accountant or auditor before filing.
