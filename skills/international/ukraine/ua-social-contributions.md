# Ukraine Unified Social Contribution (Єдиний соціальний внесок / ЄСВ / USC) — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

The Unified Social Contribution (ЄСВ) is Ukraine's single mandatory social-security
charge. It replaced four separate state social funds (pension, unemployment, temporary
disability/sickness, and accident-at-work insurance) with one consolidated contribution.
For self-employed people it is **separate from and on top of** income tax / the single
tax — see the companion skill `ua-single-tax` for the simplified-system tax itself.

> **Wartime note.** Figures below are pinned at their **1 January 2026** values.
> Ukraine is under martial law; the temporary wartime right to skip ЄСВ that existed
> in 2022–2024 was **abolished from 1 January 2025**. Several values depend on the
> statutory minimum wage (₴8,647 from 1 Jan 2026) — always **verify the current value**
> before relying on a number.

### Base and amount table (as of 1 Jan 2026; verify current minimum wage)

| Item | Basis | Indicative value (₴) |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum wage (мінімальна зарплата) | statutory, 1 Jan 2026 | 8,647 |
| ЄСВ rate | statutory | 22% |
| **Minimum** monthly contribution | 22% × 1 min. wage (₴8,647) | **1,902.34** |
| **Minimum** quarterly contribution | 1,902.34 × 3 | **5,707.02** |
| **Minimum** annual contribution | 1,902.34 × 12 | **22,828.08** |
| **Maximum** monthly base | 20 × min. wage | 172,940 *(verify)* |
| **Maximum** monthly contribution | 22% × ₴172,940 | 38,046.80 *(verify)* |
| Military/police-only cap (not for FOP) | 15 × min. wage = ₴129,705 → 22% | 28,535.10 |

### Conservative defaults

| Situation | Default assumption |
|---|---|
| Single-tax FOP (Groups 1–3) with any or no income | Owes the **minimum** ₴1,902.34/month unless a clear exemption is documented |
| FOP wants to pay below the minimum | **Not allowed** — minimum applies even at zero income |
| Income unknown for a general-system FOP | Assume profit ≥ minimum base → ₴1,902.34/month floor |
| Claimed exemption (pensioner, disability, mobilised) | Treat as **not exempt** until status and supporting documents are confirmed |
| Maximum cap multiplier in doubt | Cap at the lower (15×) base and flag for reviewer; never under-cap |
| Mid-year start/stop | Pro-rate by **months registered**, not by days |

## 2. Who Pays / Who Is Exempt

### Who pays ЄСВ "for themselves"

- **FOP (фізична особа-підприємець / sole proprietor)** on the **simplified system**
  (single-tax Groups 1, 2 and 3).
- **FOP on the general system** (загальна система) — pays 22% of **net taxable income
  (profit)**, but not less than the minimum and not more than the maximum base.
- **Independent professionals** ("особи, які провадять незалежну професійну
  діяльність") — e.g. private notaries, lawyers/advocates, arbitration managers,
  appraisers, and others registered as self-employed professionals.
- **Members of farming households** in some cases (out of scope here).

> **Single-tax payers owe ЄСВ even with zero income.** In 2026 a FOP on the simplified
> system must pay the minimum ₴1,902.34/month **regardless of whether any income or
> activity occurred**. The only way to avoid it is to fall into an exemption category
> (below) or to be officially deregistered.

### Difference: simplified vs general system at zero income

| System | No income / loss in the month |
|---|---|
| Simplified (Groups 1–3) | Still owes the **minimum** ₴1,902.34 |
| General system | **No ЄСВ** is due for a month with no net profit / a loss (ЄСВ = 22% of profit, minimum floor only applies in months with profit) |

### Who may legally NOT pay ЄСВ for themselves (exemptions)

The following FOP/self-employed categories are released from paying ЄСВ "for
themselves" — but the exemption must be supported by status and, where relevant, an
application/documents:

1. **Old-age (and certain length-of-service) pensioners** — FOP who already receive a
   pension by age are exempt; payment becomes voluntary.
2. **Persons with disabilities** who receive a pension or social assistance on the
   grounds of disability — exempt; payment becomes voluntary.
3. **FOP who are also employed** ("основне місце роботи") where the **employer pays
   ЄСВ for them at no less than the minimum** on the employment income — relief applies
   for the months the employer's contribution is at/above the minimum. The taxpayer
   should retain proof.
4. **Mobilised FOP** (called up for military service during martial law) — exempt for
   the period of service, on the basis of supporting documents (mobilisation order /
   demobilisation confirmation). The State Tax Service / Pension Fund records the period.

### Status of wartime / mobilisation reliefs in 2026

- **2022–2024 voluntary right to skip ЄСВ:** During the COVID period and then the
  full-scale-war period, single-tax FOP had a **temporary voluntary right not to pay
  ЄСВ for themselves**. This relief was **abolished from 1 January 2025.**
- **2026 position:** There is **no general wartime exemption** for ordinary FOP. Single-
  tax payers must pay the minimum even with zero income. The **mobilisation exemption**
  (item 4 above) for FOP actually called up to serve **remains** in force during martial
  law and is the main wartime relief still available.

### What ЄСВ funds

ЄСВ is the single contribution that finances the state social-insurance system:

- **State pension** (Pension Fund of Ukraine) — and it is what builds the FOP's
  **insurance length-of-service (страховий стаж)** toward a future pension; paying only
  the minimum earns roughly one month of stage per month paid.
- **Social insurance** — temporary incapacity / sickness, maternity, work-accident /
  occupational-disease, and unemployment cover.

## 3. Computation — Minimum, Voluntary Higher Base, Maximum Cap

**Core formula (per month):**

```
ЄСВ (month) = 22% × base
where  minimum base = 1 × minimum wage  (₴8,647 in 2026)
       maximum base = 20 × minimum wage (₴172,940 in 2026 — verify)
```

### Minimum (the usual case)

Almost all single-tax FOP pay on the minimum base because the law sets a **floor** of
one minimum wage regardless of actual income:

```
22% × ₴8,647 = ₴1,902.34 / month
× 3 = ₴5,707.02 / quarter
× 12 = ₴22,828.08 / year
```

### Voluntary higher base

A FOP **may choose** to pay ЄСВ on a **higher self-declared base** (anywhere between
one minimum wage and the maximum base). This is voluntary and is usually done to build
a larger future pension. Example: choosing a base of ₴20,000 → 22% × ₴20,000 =
₴4,400/month.

### Maximum cap

The base is **capped**. For 2026 the operative cap is **20 × minimum wage =
₴172,940**, giving a maximum monthly contribution of **22% × ₴172,940 = ₴38,046.80**.

> **Verify the maximum-base multiplier.** Sources conflict. The State Budget Law for
> 2026 (3 Dec 2025) and current specialist Ukrainian tax catalogues (dtkt.ua,
> Factor, Holovbukh) state the FOP maximum base is **20 × minimum wage (₴172,940)**.
> A separate **15 ×** cap (₴129,705 → ₴28,535.10) applies **only to military / police
> service members**, not to FOP. One international summary (PwC) described the 20×
> increase as "postponed," leaving 15× — this appears to be outdated for the FOP base.
> The cap only ever matters for a FOP paying voluntarily above the minimum, so the
> minimum-case figures above are unaffected. **A Ukrainian accountant must confirm the
> exact cap before relying on it.**

### Mid-year start / stop (pro-ration)

ЄСВ accrues per **month of registration**. A FOP registered on any day of a month owes
the full minimum for that month; a FOP deregistered owes for each month they were
registered. Pro-rate by **whole months**, not days.

---

## 4. Payment & Reporting Calendar

### Payment (quarterly)

Self-employed people pay ЄСВ **quarterly** by the **20th of the month following the end
of the calendar quarter**. A FOP may also pay monthly/in advance if they prefer, but
the legal deadline is quarterly.

| Period (2026) | Minimum amount | Pay by |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 (Jan–Mar 2026) | ₴5,707.02 | **20 April 2026** |
| Q2 (Apr–Jun 2026) | ₴5,707.02 | **20 July 2026** |
| Q3 (Jul–Sep 2026) | ₴5,707.02 | **20 October 2026** |
| Q4 (Oct–Dec 2026) | ₴5,707.02 | **20 January 2027** |

> If the 20th falls on a weekend/holiday the deadline is **not** automatically extended
> for ЄСВ — pay on or before the 20th. Verify against the current ДПС tax calendar.

### Reporting — 2026 changes

- **The separate ЄСВ report has been abolished as a standalone form.** Self-employed
  FOP no longer file a separate monthly or standalone annual ЄСВ report. ЄСВ data is
  reported **as part of the tax return** (in the unified single-tax declaration, via the
  ЄСВ appendix / "Додаток" / former Form D5 content folded in).
- From **2026** single-tax FOP move to **quarterly tax reporting** (for personal income
  tax, military levy and ЄСВ where relevant); FOP **without employees** generally report
  ЄСВ "for themselves" **once a year** together with the annual return.
- Indicative annual-return deadlines (verify against ДПС for the exact form/year):
  Groups 1–2 by **early March** after year-end; Group 3 quarterly returns plus the
  year-end ЄСВ appendix.

> **Reporting is mandatory even at zero income.** Missing the ЄСВ appendix is treated as
> failing to report for the whole year.

## 5. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Group 3 FOP (IT freelancer), normal year

Olena is a Group-3 single-tax FOP. She earns ₴80,000 some months, ₴0 in others.

- ЄСВ is **not** based on her income — she pays the **minimum**.
- Per month: **₴1,902.34**. Per quarter: **₴5,707.02**. Per year: **₴22,828.08**.
- This is **on top of** her single tax (5%) and military levy (1%) — see `ua-single-tax`.

### Example 2 — Group 2 FOP, no income for two months

Petro had ₴0 turnover in February and March (sick, no clients).

- As a **simplified-system** payer he **still owes** the minimum for those months.
- Q1 ЄСВ = 3 × ₴1,902.34 = **₴5,707.02**, due **20 April 2026**, despite zero income.

### Example 3 — Old-age pensioner FOP (exempt)

Maria is 63, receives an old-age pension, and runs a Group-1 FOP.

- As an **old-age pensioner** she is **exempt** from ЄСВ "for herself"; payment is
  **voluntary**.
- Default ЄСВ due: **₴0**. If she wants more pension stage she may pay voluntarily, on a
  base she chooses between ₴8,647 and ₴172,940.

### Example 4 — Employed + FOP (dual status)

Andriy works full-time for an employer who pays ЄСВ on his ₴30,000 salary, and also has
a Group-3 FOP on the side.

- The employer's ЄСВ (22% × ₴30,000 = ₴6,600/month) is **above the minimum**.
- For months where the employer's contribution ≥ the minimum, Andriy is **relieved** of
  paying ЄСВ on the FOP. He should keep proof (payslips / employer confirmation).
- Default FOP ЄСВ for those months: **₴0** (relief), but **confirm month-by-month**.

### Example 5 — Voluntary higher base for pension

Iryna (Group 3) wants a bigger future pension and elects a base of ₴25,000.

- ЄСВ = 22% × ₴25,000 = **₴5,500/month** (well below the ₴38,046.80 cap).
- She must declare the chosen higher base; it is voluntary and self-elected.

## 6. Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These situations are **not auto-decidable** — escalate to a credentialed Ukrainian
accountant / tax adviser:

| # | Situation | Why it needs judgement |
|---|---|---|
| T2-1 | **Claimed exemption** (pensioner / disability / mobilised) | Must confirm official status, dates, and supporting documents; partial-year exemptions are common. |
| T2-2 | **Mid-year registration or deregistration** | Determine exact months owed; first/last partial month rules; deregistration paperwork timing. |
| T2-3 | **Dual status (employee + FOP)** | Relief only for months the employer's ЄСВ ≥ minimum; verify each month and the employment income level. |
| T2-4 | **General-system FOP with fluctuating profit/loss** | ЄСВ = 22% of profit with a min/max collar; loss months differ from simplified-system months. |
| T2-5 | **Maximum-base cap** (paying voluntarily above the minimum) | Cap multiplier (15× vs 20×) must be confirmed for the year before applying. |
| T2-6 | **Mobilisation period overlapping a quarter** | Apportioning exempt vs non-exempt months; documentation from the military unit. |
| T2-7 | **Independent professional vs FOP classification** | Different registration and base rules for notaries/advocates/etc. |
| T2-8 | **Backdated arrears / penalties** | Penalty and late-interest computation, voluntary disclosure. |

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do not** tell a single-tax FOP they can skip ЄСВ in a zero-income month — they
  cannot (simplified system); they owe the minimum.
- **Do not** apply the 2022–2024 voluntary-non-payment relief to 2025 or 2026 — it was
  abolished from 1 Jan 2025.
- **Do not** assert an exemption (pensioner / disability / mobilised / dual-status)
  without confirmed status and supporting documents.
- **Do not** state the maximum-base cap as settled fact without a Ukrainian accountant
  confirming the multiplier for the year (15× vs 20×) — see §3.
- **Do not** quote ₴ figures without anchoring them to the **current minimum wage** and
  adding "verify current value."
- **Do not** conflate ЄСВ with the single tax or the military levy — they are separate
  charges (see `ua-single-tax`).
- **Do not** treat the quarterly **20th** deadline as auto-extended over weekends/
  holidays without checking the ДПС calendar.
