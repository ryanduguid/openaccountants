# Ukraine Business Formation (Реєстрація ФОП / ТОВ) — Self-Employed Skill v1.0

This skill covers **how a self-employed person sets up a business in Ukraine**: registering as
a **ФОП** (фізична особа-підприємець / sole proprietor), choosing **КВЕД** activity codes and
a tax system at registration, the **VAT (ПДВ)** threshold, **ЄСВ** registration, opening a
bank account, and the decision between a ФОП and a **ТОВ** (товариство з обмеженою
відповідальністю / LLC). It is the entry point. Once formed, route ongoing work to the
companion skills: `ua-single-tax`, `ua-income-tax`, `ua-social-contributions`,
`ua-bookkeeping`, and `ukraine-vat`.

> **Wartime note (martial law):** Figures below are as of **1 January 2026**. Single-tax fixed
> amounts and the ЄСВ minimum are pinned at their 1-Jan values for the whole year and do **not**
> change mid-year. The elevated 5% military levy (військовий збір) on wages and the 1% military
> levy on Group 3 income remain in force under martial law. *(Verify current procedure — wartime
> rules change frequently.)*

### Conservative defaults

When information is missing, default to the safer (more conservative) assumption and flag it:

1. **Default to Group 3 (5%)** for a freelancer / IT contractor / online business unless the
   client confirms they only serve Ukrainian consumers and want the lowest fixed cost. Group 3
   is the only group that may invoice **foreign clients** and **legal entities** without
   restriction. Do not assume Group 1 or 2 eligibility.
2. **Assume the single-tax election is NOT automatic.** A ФОП registered without a timely
   election lands on the **general system** (загальна система) by default. Always confirm the
   election was filed.
3. **Assume VAT registration is required** once taxable turnover crosses ₴1,000,000 in any
   rolling 12 months — even for a ФОП — unless the client is a single-tax payer for whom the
   threshold-based mandatory rule is disapplied (single-tax payers register for VAT only when
   they opt into the 3% Group 3 rate or voluntarily). *(Verify current procedure.)*
4. **Assume ЄСВ is due** at the minimum monthly amount unless a documented exemption applies
   (age/length-of-service pensioner, or person with disability receiving the corresponding
   pension/assistance).
5. **Never confirm a КВЕД code is "allowed on single tax" from memory** — check the barred-
   activities list (see `ua-single-tax`) and flag for reviewer confirmation.
6. Treat all amounts and deadlines as **"verify current value/procedure"** before relying on
   them for a filing. Defer the final call to a qualified Ukrainian accountant.

## Section 2 — ФОП registration, step by step

A ФОП is **not a separate legal entity** — it is an individual who has acquired the status of
entrepreneur. There is **no charter capital**, and the individual is **personally liable** for
business debts with their personal assets. State registration of a ФОП is **free of charge**.

### 2.1 Choose your registration channel

| Channel | How | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Diia portal / app** (recommended) | diia.gov.ua → "Реєстрація ФОП". Authenticate via **BankID**, **Diia.Signature (Дія.Підпис)**, or a **qualified electronic signature (КЕП/QES)**. | Fastest, free, fully online; can take ~5–10 minutes to submit. Registration is automatic with no registrar involvement. Result usually available within ~1 business day (statutory limit up to 24 hours / 1 business day). *(Verify current procedure.)* |
| **State registrar (ЦНАП)** | In person at a Центр надання адміністративних послуг (Administrative Services Centre). | Submit form **Form 1** (заява про державну реєстрацію ФОП) + ID. Useful if you have no QES. |
| **Notary** | A notary acting as a state registrar. | Convenient if you also need notarised documents; notary charges a fee. |

### 2.2 Documents / information needed

- **Ukrainian passport / ID card** (or a valid passport shown via the Diia app v2.0+); foreign
  nationals: passport with a notarised Ukrainian translation plus a residence document.
- **РНОКПП** (реєстраційний номер облікової картки платника податків — taxpayer ID number, the
  "tax number"), or **УНЗР** (the 13-digit unique record number on the ID card).
- **Registered address** (місце проживання) — used as the ФОП's address.
- **Chosen КВЕД codes** (see 2.3).
- **Chosen tax system** and, if simplified, the **single-tax group** (see Section 3).
- For Diia: an active **BankID**, **Diia.Signature**, or **QES (КЕП)**.

### 2.3 Choose КВЕД activity codes

- **КВЕД** = Класифікатор видів економічної діяльності (the activity classifier). The current
  edition is **КВЕД-2010 (ДК 009:2010)**. A migration to **NACE 2.1-UA** is planned for
  **1 January 2027** — until then КВЕД-2010 applies. *(Verify current value.)*
- You may register **as many codes as you like**, but exactly **one must be the primary (основний)**
  code — the one generating the most income. Practitioners typically register **5–7 codes**
  up front to avoid filing changes later.
- **Critical for single-tax eligibility:** your codes must not fall under the **barred
  activities** list for the simplified system (e.g. excise goods production/trade, gambling,
  currency exchange, mining of precious metals/stones, certain financial intermediation).
  See `ua-single-tax` for the full list. A barred КВЕД blocks single-tax registration.
- Common freelancer/IT examples *(verify the exact code matches the work)*: **62.01**
  Computer programming; **62.02** Computer consultancy; **63.11** Data processing/hosting;
  **70.22** Business and management consulting; **73.11** Advertising agencies.

### 2.4 Elect the tax system at registration

- The single-tax election is filed via the **заява про обрання спрощеної системи оподаткування**
  (application to choose the simplified system). On Diia it is submitted **together with** the
  ФОП registration application.
- **Timing rule:** if the election is filed **within 10 days of state registration**, the ФОП
  is treated as a single-tax payer **from the date of registration** (for **Group 3** and the
  general rule; for **Groups 1/2** the simplified status starts from the **first day of the
  following month**). Miss this window and you sit on the **general system** until you can
  switch from the start of a future quarter. *(Verify current procedure.)*
- **Switching later:** to move onto / between single-tax groups afterwards, file the application
  **no later than 15 calendar days before the start of the next quarter**; the new status takes
  effect from that quarter's first day.
- If you take **no action**, you default to the **general system** (загальна система —
  18% personal income tax + 5% military levy on net profit; see `ua-income-tax`).

### 2.5 ЄСВ (unified social contribution) registration

- Registration as an **ЄСВ payer** is **automatic** on ФОП registration — the State Tax Service
  picks it up from the ЄДР; no separate ЄСВ application is normally required.
- ЄСВ is **22% of the minimum wage**, i.e. a minimum of **₴1,902.34/month** in 2026
  (≈ ₴5,707.02/quarter), **payable regardless of income** and even if there was no income that
  month, unless an exemption applies. *(Verify current value.)*
- **Exemptions:** age/length-of-service **pensioners**, and **persons with disability** who
  actually receive the corresponding pension or social assistance, may be exempt from ЄСВ.
- From **2026** ФОПs file a **unified quarterly report** (ЄСВ + PIT/military levy) instead of
  monthly reporting. See `ua-social-contributions`.

### 2.6 Open a business bank account

- A ФОП should open a **dedicated current account for business activity (підприємницький
  рахунок)** — separate from any personal card. Single-tax receipts must flow through the
  business account.
- Opening is free at most banks (Privat24, Monobank, Oschadbank, Raiffeisen, etc.) and is
  often available online once the ФОП is in the ЄДР.
- **Newly registered ФОПs face heightened financial monitoring** in roughly the **first 6
  months** — expect transfer limits and documentation requests. *(Verify current procedure.)*

### 2.7 What you receive

- An **extract from the ЄДР (витяг з Єдиного державного реєстру)** confirming the ФОП and КВЕД
  codes — downloadable from the Diia account/cabinet.
- Tax-payer registration with the **ДПС** and, if elected, single-tax status from the relevant
  start date.

### 2.8 Timing & cost summary

| Item | Cost | Time |
|---|---|---|
| State registration of ФОП | **Free** | Up to 1 business day (often same day via Diia) |
| КЕП / QES (if needed) | Free–₴ small fee depending on provider | Same day |
| Single-tax election | Free (filed with registration) | — |
| Bank account | Usually free | Same day–few days |

## Section 3 — Choosing the tax system at formation (decision table)

| Question | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 | General system |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Typical user | Market/retail trader, household services | Services & production for **Ukrainian** consumers and single-tax payers | **Freelancers, IT, exporters, B2B, foreign clients** | High-cost or barred-activity businesses; those exceeding limits |
| May serve **legal entities / VAT payers / foreign clients**? | No (only retail to public) | Only the **population** and other single-tax payers — **not** general-system businesses | **Yes — anyone, incl. foreign** | Yes |
| Employees allowed | **0** | up to **10** | **unlimited** | unlimited |
| 2026 annual income limit | **₴1,444,049** (167 × min wage) | **₴7,211,598** (834 × min wage) | **₴10,091,049** (1,167 × min wage) | none |
| Single-tax rate (2026) | up to **₴332.80/month** fixed (≤10% of living wage) | up to **₴1,729.40/month** fixed (≤20% of min wage) | **5% of income** (non-VAT) or **3% + VAT** | n/a |
| Military levy (військовий збір) 2026 | **₴864.70/month** fixed | **₴864.70/month** fixed | **1% of income** | 5% of net profit |
| ЄСВ | ₴1,902.34/month min | ₴1,902.34/month min | ₴1,902.34/month min | ₴1,902.34/month min (on profit, capped) |
| Income tax (ПДФО) | none (covered by single tax) | none | none | **18% of net profit** |
| Bookkeeping burden | Lowest | Low | Low–medium | **Highest** (income & expense ledger, documents) |

*(All amounts: verify current value before relying on them.)*

**Default routing logic:**

- Foreign clients, IT/dev, B2B services, or expecting >₴7.2m → **Group 3 (5%)**.
- Local services/production, only Ukrainian customers, ≤10 staff, predictable low cost → **Group 2**.
- Tiny local retail/household services, no employees → **Group 1**.
- Barred КВЕД, very high turnover, or VAT-recovery-heavy operations → **general system** (and
  likely VAT registration).

> Detailed group rules, limits and barred activities live in **`ua-single-tax`**. General-system
> profit tax lives in **`ua-income-tax`**. ЄСВ lives in **`ua-social-contributions`**.

---

## Section 4 — VAT (ПДВ) registration

- **Mandatory threshold:** taxable supplies exceeding **₴1,000,000** (excluding VAT) over the
  **last rolling 12 months**. The registration application must be filed **no later than the
  10th day of the month following** the month the threshold was crossed.
- **Single-tax payers are excluded from the turnover-based mandatory rule.** A Group 1/2/3 ФОП
  on the **non-VAT** track does **not** auto-register for VAT just for crossing ₴1m; they become
  a VAT payer only by **opting into the 3% Group 3 rate** or **registering voluntarily**.
  A general-system business **does** hit the mandatory ₴1m rule. *(Verify current procedure.)*
- **Standard VAT rate: 20%** (reduced rates apply to specific supplies, e.g. certain
  pharmaceuticals/medical 7%, some agricultural 14%). *(Verify current value.)*
- **Voluntary registration** is available before the threshold — useful if your customers are
  VAT payers who want input-VAT credits, or you incur large input VAT you want to recover.
  Voluntary VAT for a freelancer is usually **not** worthwhile due to reporting and the
  **electronic VAT administration system (СЕА ПДВ / electronic VAT account)** overhead.
- Full mechanics, return preparation (Декларація з ПДВ) and the electronic VAT account are in
  **`ukraine-vat`**.

## Section 5 — ФОП vs ТОВ comparison

| Feature | **ФОП** (sole proprietor) | **ТОВ** (LLC) |
|---|---|---|
| Legal nature | Individual with entrepreneur status — **not** a separate legal entity | Separate **legal entity** |
| Liability | **Personal** — owner liable with personal assets | **Limited** to contributions to charter capital |
| Charter capital | **None** | **No statutory minimum** (can be ₴1); must be declared & contributed within **6 months** of registration *(verify current procedure)* |
| Founders / owners | One individual | 1+ participants (учасники), individuals and/or entities |
| Registration | Free, ~1 day via Diia | Free state fee; needs a **charter (статут)** and founders' decision; ~1 day once docs ready, but more prep |
| Tax options | Single tax (Groups 1/2/3) **or** general system | **Corporate income tax 18%** (general) **or** single tax **Group 3** (5% / 3%+VAT) |
| Drawing money out | Owner's profit is freely available (no extra tax on withdrawal) | Profit distributed as **dividends** — additional taxation on distribution |
| Accounting | Light (single tax) to moderate (general) | **Full double-entry accounting**, financial statements, accountant usually required |
| Closing | Relatively quick (see Section 8) | **Liquidation** procedure — slow, formal, can take months |
| Best for | Freelancers, solo consultants, IT contractors, small service businesses | Multiple founders, investor/partner structures, limited-liability needs, larger operations, businesses needing to scale or sell |

### When a ТОВ makes sense

- You have **partners / co-founders** or want to bring in investors / split equity.
- You need **limited liability** to ring-fence personal assets from business risk.
- Your turnover/headcount will **exceed the Group 3 single-tax limit** (₴10.09m / 2026) or your
  activity is **barred** from the simplified system.
- You plan to **sell the business** or build something institutional.

### ТОВ on single tax (Group 3)

A ТОВ may itself elect the **Group 3 single tax** (5% non-VAT or 3% + VAT) instead of the 18%
corporate income tax, **if** it meets Group 3 conditions (within the income limit, permitted
activities, ≤25% owned by non-single-tax legal entities, etc.). This gives a small company a
flat 5% turnover tax similar to a Group 3 ФОП — but the company still bears **full accounting**,
and **profit taken out as dividends is taxed again**. So a Group 3 ФОП is usually cheaper for a
true solo operator; a Group 3 ТОВ suits a small team that needs limited liability.
*(Verify current eligibility conditions.)*

---

## Section 6 — Worked examples

> Illustrative only. Round figures; **verify current values** before filing.

### Persona A — "Oksana", freelance web developer with foreign clients

Invoices US/EU clients ~₴1.2m/year. Foreign clients ⇒ **must use Group 3** (Groups 1/2 cannot
serve foreign or legal-entity clients). Registers ФОП via **Diia**, picks КВЕД **62.01**, files
the single-tax election **within 10 days** ⇒ Group 3 from registration date. Annual cost:
**5% single tax + 1% military levy** on income, plus **₴1,902.34/month ЄСВ**. Stays **below
₴1m? No — above** — but single-tax payers are exempt from the turnover-based mandatory VAT rule,
so **no VAT registration** needed unless she opts for the 3% track. **Routing:** `ua-single-tax`,
`ua-social-contributions`.

### Persona B — "Petro", local barber

Serves walk-in customers (the public) only, employs 2 people, ~₴900k/year. Eligible for
**Group 2** (services to population, ≤10 employees, within ₴7.21m limit). Fixed **₴1,729.40/month**
single tax + **₴864.70/month** military levy + **₴1,902.34/month** ЄСВ, regardless of monthly
takings. Registers via Diia with КВЕД **96.02** (hairdressing). **Routing:** `ua-single-tax`.

### Persona C — "Maria & Andrii", two co-founders launching a SaaS

Want **limited liability**, plan to raise investment and hire a team. A ФОП can't have
co-owners ⇒ form a **ТОВ** with a charter and two participants. Elect **Group 3 (5%)** while
under the ₴10.09m limit to keep tax simple; switch to 18% corporate tax if they outgrow it or
need VAT recovery at scale. Note dividends to founders are taxed on distribution. **Routing:**
this skill + a qualified accountant for the charter and accounting setup.

### Persona D — "Ihor", IT contractor crossing into VAT territory

Group 3 ФОП billing one large Ukrainian VAT-paying client ~₴3m/year. As a non-VAT single-tax
payer he is **not forced** to register for VAT by turnover. But his client wants input-VAT
credits, so he considers **voluntary VAT** + the **3% Group 3 track**. Trade-off: 3% + 20% VAT
admin (СЕА ПДВ) vs 5% and no VAT. **Routing:** `ukraine-vat` + reviewer to model the net cost.

---

## Section 7 — Tier 2 (escalate to a qualified Ukrainian accountant)

Stop and route to a credentialed Ukrainian accountant/lawyer when:

- The client is a **foreign national / non-resident** wanting to register a ФОП or ТОВ
  (residence, translation, immigration and tax-residency issues).
- **КВЕД selection is ambiguous** or may touch a **barred activity** (excise goods, gambling,
  financial services, precious metals, currency exchange).
- A **ТОВ** is involved — charter drafting, beneficial-ownership (UBO) declaration, charter
  capital, dividends.
- **VAT** registration, the electronic VAT account (СЕА ПДВ), or the 3% vs 5% decision.
- Mid-year **switching** between tax systems/groups, or retroactive corrections.
- **ЄСВ exemption** claims (pensioner / disability) or **closure / liquidation**.
- Anything under evolving **martial-law** rules where the procedure may have changed.

---

## Section 8 — Reference + checklist

### 8.1 Closing / deregistering a ФОП (basics)

1. **File for state deregistration (припинення підприємницької діяльності)** via **Diia** or a
   state registrar — free, and the ЄДР record is updated quickly (often ~1 day).
2. **Deregistration does NOT end tax obligations.** You must still:
   - File a **final single-tax / income declaration** for the period up to the closure date.
   - **Pay outstanding single tax, military levy, ЄСВ, and any VAT** up to closure.
   - **Cancel VAT registration** if registered.
   - **ЄСВ is owed up to the month of closure** — file the closing ЄСВ report and settle.
3. Keep all **records and primary documents** for the statutory retention period (generally
   **1095 days / 3 years**, longer in some cases). *(Verify current value.)*
4. The ДПС may run a **closing review**; debts surviving closure are pursued against the
   individual personally. *(Verify current procedure.)*

### 8.2 Formation checklist

- [ ] РНОКПП / tax number confirmed; ID ready (passport or Diia app)
- [ ] Registration channel chosen (Diia / ЦНАП / notary); QES or BankID ready if online
- [ ] КВЕД codes selected (1 primary + extras; none barred from single tax)
- [ ] Tax system decided (Group 1/2/3 vs general); single-tax **заява** filed **within 10 days**
- [ ] ЄСВ payer status confirmed (auto); exemption checked if pensioner/disability
- [ ] Turnover projected vs **₴1,000,000** VAT threshold; voluntary VAT considered
- [ ] Business **current account** opened; aware of 6-month monitoring on new ФОП
- [ ] ЄДР extract (витяг) downloaded; ДПС registration confirmed
- [ ] Reporting calendar noted (quarterly unified report from 2026); reviewer sign-off obtained

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** assert that single-tax status is automatic on ФОП registration — without a timely
  **заява** the ФОП defaults to the **general system**.
- **Do NOT** place a ФОП with **foreign or legal-entity clients** into Group 1 or Group 2 —
  only **Group 3** may serve them.
- **Do NOT** confirm a КВЕД code is single-tax-eligible from memory; check the barred-activities
  list in `ua-single-tax` and flag for reviewer confirmation.
- **Do NOT** tell a single-tax ФОП they must register for VAT merely for crossing ₴1m — the
  turnover-based mandatory rule does not apply to single-tax payers (verify).
- **Do NOT** state ЄСВ can be skipped because there was no income — it is due at the minimum
  monthly amount unless a documented exemption (pensioner / disability) applies.
- **Do NOT** advise a non-resident / foreign founder without escalating to a qualified
  Ukrainian professional.
- **Do NOT** treat ФОП deregistration as ending tax/ЄСВ liabilities — final declarations,
  payments and (if applicable) VAT cancellation are still required.
- **Do NOT** present any amount, rate, limit, or deadline as final without a
  **"verify current value/procedure"** flag and reviewer sign-off.
- **Do NOT** draft a ТОВ charter, UBO declaration, or liquidation documents — route to a lawyer.
