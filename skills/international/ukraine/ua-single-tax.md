> **Wartime note:** A 1% → 5% increase to the military levy (військовий збір) took effect 1 Dec 2024 and is in force throughout 2026 under martial law. Figures below are as of **1 January 2026**. Fixed amounts are pinned at their 1 Jan value for the whole year and do **not** change mid-year even if the minimum/living wage rises.

### The three FOP groups (2026)

| | Group 1 | Group 2 | Group 3 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Who** | Retail trade at markets / personal services to individuals | Services, restaurant, production/sale of goods | Almost any activity; freelancers, IT, consultants |
| **Customers** | Individuals only | Individuals + other single-tax payers | Anyone (incl. companies, foreign clients) |
| **Employees** | 0 | ≤ 10 | Unlimited |
| **Annual income cap** | 167 × min. wage | 834 × min. wage | 1,167 × min. wage |
| **Annual cap (indicative ₴, min wage ₴8,647)** | ≈ ₴1.44 m | ≈ ₴7.21 m | ≈ ₴10.09 m |
| **Single tax** | up to 10% of living wage / month (fixed) | up to 20% of min. wage / month (fixed) | 5% of income (non-VAT) **or** 3% of income (VAT-registered) |
| **Military levy** | 10% of min. wage / month (fixed) | 10% of min. wage / month (fixed) | 1% of income |
| **VAT** | No | No | Optional (3% rate path) |

### Indicative monthly fixed amounts (as of 1 Jan 2026; verify current min/living wage)

| Item | Basis | Indicative ₴/month |
|---|---|---|
| Living wage (прожитковий мінімум) | — | ₴3,328 |
| Minimum wage (мінімальна зарплата) | — | ₴8,647 |
| Group 1 single tax | 10% × living wage | ≈ ₴332.80 |
| Group 2 single tax | 20% × min. wage | ≈ ₴1,729.40 |
| Groups 1 & 2 military levy | 10% × min. wage | ≈ ₴864.70 |
| ЄСВ (USC), min | 22% × min. wage | ≈ ₴1,902.34 |

**Worked monthly cost, Group 2 (any income up to the cap):** ₴1,729.40 (single tax) + ₴864.70 (military levy) + ₴1,902.34 (ЄСВ) ≈ **₴4,496/month, fixed**, regardless of how much is earned up to the annual cap.

**Worked cost, Group 3 non-VAT:** 5% of turnover (single tax) + 1% of turnover (military levy) + ₴1,902.34/month ЄСВ. On ₴100,000 revenue in a month: ₴5,000 + ₴1,000 + ₴1,902.34 = **₴7,902.34**.

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Group not stated | Group 3, non-VAT (5%) — the freelancer default |
| VAT status unknown (Group 3) | Non-VAT (5% rate) |
| Whether ЄСВ applies | Assume YES — single-tax payers owe ЄСВ even with zero income in 2026 |
| Foreign-currency income date | Date of receipt at NBU rate |
| Activity eligibility unknown | Flag for review — see Section 3 prohibitions |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs
- **Minimum:** FOP group, VAT status (Group 3), and full-year bank/turnover records (UAH and any FX accounts).
- **Recommended:** registration extract (виписка з ЄДР) showing КВЕД activity codes, prior-year declaration, ЄСВ payment history.
- **Ideal:** Книга обліку доходів (income ledger), all FX receipts with NBU conversion dates.

### Refusal catalogue
- **R-UA-1 — Income over the group cap.** Exceeding the cap triggers a 15% single-tax penalty on the excess and forced transfer to the general system. Escalate.
- **R-UA-2 — Barred activities.** Single tax is not available for, e.g., excisable goods (except retail fuel within limits), gambling, currency exchange, financial intermediation, mineral extraction, trade in jewellery. Flag and route to general system.
- **R-UA-3 — Company (ТОВ).** This skill is FOP (individual) only. A ТОВ on single tax (Group 3) is different. Escalate.
- **R-UA-4 — Non-resident.** Single tax is for Ukrainian-resident FOPs. Escalate.

---

## Section 3 — Eligibility & Activity Rules (Tier 1)

- **Group 3 is the default for freelancers/IT/consultants** because it allows company and foreign clients, has no employee cap, and is turnover-based (no tax in a zero-revenue month except ЄСВ).
- **Barred from the simplified system entirely:** excisable goods production/sale (limited fuel/retail exceptions), gambling/lotteries, FX exchange, financial services and intermediation, extraction/sale of minerals (except certain local), trade in antiques/art via auction, technical testing, and management of enterprises. Such activity in any month forces transfer to the general system.
- **Foreign income:** permitted for Group 3. Convert to UAH at the NBU rate on the date funds arrive in the FOP account. Currency must generally be sold per NBU rules; the UAH proceeds are the single-tax base.

---

## Section 4 — Rates, Base & Computation (Tier 1)

### Group 3 (turnover-based)
- **Base:** gross income received (cash basis — money in the account / cash received), not profit. Expenses are **not** deducted under the single tax.
- **Single tax:** 5% (non-VAT) or 3% (VAT-registered, with separate VAT obligations).
- **Military levy:** 1% of the same income base (since 1 Jan 2025 for Group 3).
- Returns/refunds to customers reduce the base.

### Groups 1 & 2 (fixed)
- Pay a fixed monthly single tax (set by the local council up to the statutory cap) plus a fixed monthly military levy, **regardless of income**, up to the annual cap.

### ЄСВ on top (all groups)
- Unified social contribution is **separate** from the single tax: minimum 22% of the minimum wage per month (≈ ₴1,902.34), payable quarterly. Owed even in months with no income (2026). See ua-social-contributions.

## Section 5 — Filing & Payment Calendar (Tier 1)

| Group | Single-tax return | Single-tax payment | Military levy | ЄСВ |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 & 2 | Annual (within 60 days of year-end) | Monthly, by 20th | Monthly, by 20th | Quarterly, by 19th of month after quarter |
| 3 | Quarterly (within 40 days of quarter-end) | Quarterly, within 50 days of quarter-end | With the single tax (quarterly) | Quarterly, by 19th of month after quarter |

> From 1 Jan 2026 the separate **monthly** ЄСВ/PIT/military-levy report for sole proprietors is abolished; obligations are reported within the single-tax return / annual cycle. Confirm current ДПС guidance.

---

## Section 6 — Worked Examples

**Example 1 — IT freelancer, Group 3 non-VAT, foreign client.**
Receives USD 3,000 from a US client; NBU rate on receipt 41.50 → ₴124,500 income.
Single tax 5% = ₴6,225; military levy 1% = ₴1,245; plus the fixed monthly ЄСВ ₴1,902.34. No expense deduction.

**Example 2 — Group 2 hairdresser, slow month.**
Earns ₴5,000 in the month. Still pays the **fixed** Group 2 single tax (≈₴1,729.40) + military levy (≈₴864.70) + ЄСВ (₴1,902.34) ≈ ₴4,496, because Group 2 is a fixed regime.

**Example 3 — Approaching the cap.**
A Group 3 FOP hits ₴10.09 m of income in November. Any income above the 1,167 × min-wage cap is taxed at **15%** single tax and the FOP must move to the general system from the next quarter. Flag well before the cap.

---

## Section 10 — Prohibitions

- NEVER deduct business expenses against the single-tax base — it is turnover-based, not profit-based.
- NEVER omit ЄСВ — it is due on top of the single tax, even in zero-income months (2026).
- NEVER omit the military levy (1% for Group 3; fixed monthly for Groups 1–2) — it is in force under martial law.
- NEVER apply Group 1/2 fixed amounts to a freelancer serving companies or foreign clients — that requires Group 3.
- NEVER treat income over the group cap as still 5% — the excess is 15% and forces a regime change.
- NEVER compute a final figure as definitive — direct the client to a Ukrainian accountant/auditor.
