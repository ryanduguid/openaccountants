# Ukraine — Taxation of Virtual Assets / Cryptocurrency for Individuals (2026) v1.0

> **CRITICAL — READ FIRST — LEGISLATIVE STATUS (as of May 2026).**
> The rules in this skill describe **Draft Law No. 10225-d** ("On Amendments to the
> Tax Code of Ukraine and Certain Other Legislative Acts of Ukraine Regarding the
> Regulation of the Virtual Asset Market"), introduced 24 April 2025. As of the last
> verification it had **passed only the FIRST reading** in the Verkhovna Rada
> (246 of 450 votes). It had **NOT** been adopted in the second/final reading,
> **NOT** signed by the President, and was therefore **NOT in force**, even though
> the bill itself sets a target effective date of **1 January 2026**. Substantial
> amendments were expected before the second reading. **Until the final text is
> enacted and published, every figure and rule below is a PROPOSAL and may change.**
> You MUST re-verify the current in-force status on tax.gov.ua / zakon.rada.gov.ua /
> the Verkhovna Rada bill card before relying on any number. Treat all outputs as
> draft pending confirmation of enactment.

### Conservative defaults (apply when facts or the final law are uncertain)
- **Assume the law is NOT yet in force** unless you have positively verified enactment. Tell the user when the rules become effective and what is still pending.
- If unsure whether a receipt is taxable now or only on disposal, default to the **disposal-only** model that the draft adopts, but flag the uncertainty.
- If acquisition cost is **undocumented**, default to **proceeds = full taxable base** (no cost deduction). Documented cost is required to reduce the gain.
- Use the **NBU official exchange rate** on the relevant transaction date for UAH conversion unless a more specific rule applies.
- Treat **frequent, organised, profit-seeking mining/trading** as potential **business activity** (FOP / legal entity), which falls **outside** this individual-investor skill — route to ua-single-tax or a corporate skill.
- Where the draft offers options (e.g. taxing staking at receipt vs at sale), present the **conservative** reading and mark "verify current in-force status".

## 2. Taxable events & what is NOT taxed

The draft taxes the **investment-style gain realised on disposal of a virtual asset**, mirroring the existing Tax Code mechanism for income from the sale of investment assets.

### Taxable events
- **Disposal of a virtual asset for fiat money** (e.g. selling BTC for UAH, USD or EUR — cashing out). This is the core taxable event.
- **Disposal of a virtual asset in exchange for goods, services or other property** (i.e. spending crypto / barter where ownership passes for non-crypto value). Treat as a disposal at market value.

### NOT taxed (per the draft)
- **Crypto-to-crypto exchanges.** Exchanging one virtual asset for another (e.g. BTC → USDT, ETH → USDC) is **exempt** — no taxable income arises at the swap. Income is recognised only when the position is later converted to fiat/goods/services. *(This is a deliberate design choice in 10225-d / the NSSMC matrix; re-verify it survived the second reading, as crypto-to-crypto neutrality is the single most likely provision to be narrowed.)*
- **Transfers between the holder's own wallets / accounts.** Moving the same asset between wallets you control is not a disposal — no change of ownership, no tax.
- **Receipt at issuance, creation, or free of charge** (incl. tokens received in exchange for personal data) — generally **not income at receipt**; tax is deferred to eventual disposal (see §5).
- **Small annual proceeds** below a de-minimis threshold tied to the **minimum monthly wage** — the draft contemplates exempting annual virtual-asset income up to **one minimum monthly wage**. *(Exact threshold/wording must be confirmed in the final text — verify current in-force status.)*

> Because crypto-to-crypto is not taxed, the practical taxable universe is **off-ramps**: the moment value leaves the crypto domain into fiat, goods or services.

## 3. Computing the gain — proceeds, acquisition cost, FX conversion, losses

The taxable base for the year is the **net positive investment result**:

```
Annual taxable gain = Σ (proceeds on each disposal in UAH)
                    − Σ (documented acquisition cost of the assets disposed of, in UAH)
                    − allowable transaction costs (where documented/permitted)
Tax due = Annual taxable gain × (PIT rate + 5% military levy)
        where PIT rate = 18% standard, or 5% under the 2026 transition (§4)
```

### Proceeds
- The fiat amount (or fair market value of goods/services) received on disposal, converted to **UAH** at the **NBU rate on the transaction date**.

### Acquisition cost (cost basis)
- **Documented** cost of acquiring the disposed asset (purchase price + directly attributable, documented costs), in UAH.
- **No documentation → no deduction.** If the holder cannot evidence acquisition cost, the **entire disposal proceeds** become the taxable base. This makes record-keeping decisive (see §7).
- Cost-basis ordering method (FIFO / specific identification / weighted average) is **not unambiguously fixed** in the public draft summaries. Default to a consistent, defensible method (FIFO is the conservative, common choice) and **document the method used**; verify what the enacted regulations require.

### Foreign-exchange / NBU conversion
- All amounts in foreign fiat or foreign-currency-denominated values are converted to **UAH using the NBU official rate** on the relevant date. Exchange-rate differences feed into the financial-result calculation.

### Losses
- The draft allows a **net loss to be carried FORWARD** to offset gains from virtual-asset transactions in **subsequent years**. Losses are ring-fenced to the virtual-asset category (they do not offset salary or other income). *(Carry-back is not provided; carry-forward duration/limits to be confirmed — verify current in-force status.)*

## 4. The 2026 preferential 5% transition rule

To encourage voluntary disclosure and a smooth start, the draft provides a **one-off transitional regime in the first year**:

- **Eligibility:** the virtual asset must have been **acquired BEFORE the law's effective date** (i.e. legacy holdings), **and disposed of during 2026** (the first year the regime is in force).
- **Rate:** such gains are taxed at a **preferential 5% PIT** instead of 18%. The **5% military levy continues to apply** in the published descriptions, so the practical preferential combined rate is commonly described as **5% + 5% = 10%** for 2026. *(Whether the military levy is reduced/waived under the preferential PIT is NOT fully settled across sources — flag and verify in the final text.)*
- **After the window:** from 2027 onward (and for assets acquired **after** the effective date), the **standard 18% + 5% = 23%** applies.
- **Purpose:** a fixed, low entry rate to bring pre-existing, often poorly documented, holdings into the system.

> Practical guidance: a holder sitting on large pre-law gains has a strong incentive to realise (cash out) eligible legacy positions **within 2026** to lock in the 5% PIT, **provided** the law is actually in force and the asset qualifies. Do NOT advise acting on this until enactment is confirmed.

## 5. Mining, staking, airdrops, hard forks

The published draft / NSSMC "tax matrix" leans toward a **disposal-only** model for individuals — i.e. tokens received from these activities are generally **not income at the moment of receipt**, and tax arises **when the tokens are later sold/converted** (with acquisition cost frequently treated as low or zero, so most of the proceeds become gain). However, several of these treatments are **conceptual options, not finalised law**, and must be flagged.

| Activity | Likely individual treatment (draft) | Confidence / flag |
|---|---|---|
| **Mining** | Tokens created by mining are **not taxed at creation**; taxed on disposal. BUT **regular, profit-seeking, infrastructure-dependent mining is likely BUSINESS activity** (FOP / company), outside this individual skill. Small-scale personal mining may use de-minimis. | Medium — business-vs-personal line is a key judgement; verify |
| **Staking** | **Two options debated:** (a) tax staking rewards as income **at receipt** (like deposit interest), or (b) tax **only at sale**. The draft/matrix tilts toward recognising income **on conversion to fiat**. | **Low — unsettled.** Default conservative: be ready for receipt-level taxation; verify in-force text |
| **Airdrops** | Generally **not taxed at receipt**; taxed on later disposal. Cost basis often **zero**. DAO/participation rewards may be ordinary income. | Medium — verify |
| **Hard forks** | New tokens from a fork: **not taxed at receipt**, taxed on disposal. | Low/Medium — verify |
| **Free issuance / tokens for personal data** | Explicitly contemplated as **non-taxable at receipt**. | Medium — verify |

> If the user's activity is **systematic and commercial** (mining farm, professional trading desk, validator-as-a-business), this **individual investor** skill does **not** apply — route to the Ukrainian business regimes (FOP single tax via **ua-single-tax**, or corporate income tax). Flag clearly.

## 6. Worked examples

All examples assume the law is in force as drafted; **re-verify before relying**. Rates: standard 18% PIT + 5% levy; 2026 preferential 5% PIT (+5% levy on the descriptions used here).

### Example A — Simple cash-out, standard rate
- Bought 1 BTC for **₴1,000,000** (documented), acquired **after** the effective date.
- Sold 1 BTC for **₴1,600,000** in 2027.
- Gain = 1,600,000 − 1,000,000 = **₴600,000**.
- Tax = 600,000 × 23% = **₴138,000** (PIT 18% = 108,000 + levy 5% = 30,000).
- Net after tax = ₴462,000.

### Example B — Pre-law asset sold in 2026 (preferential 5%)
- Bought 2 ETH for **₴100,000** in 2023 (documented), i.e. **before** the effective date.
- Sold 2 ETH for **₴300,000** in **2026**.
- Gain = 300,000 − 100,000 = **₴200,000**, qualifies for the transition.
- Tax = 200,000 × (5% PIT + 5% levy) = 200,000 × 10% = **₴20,000**.
- Compare standard 23% = ₴46,000 → the transition saves **₴26,000**. *(If the final law also waives the levy under the preferential rate, tax would be ₴10,000 — confirm.)*

### Example C — Crypto-to-crypto then cash-out
- Buy BTC for **₴500,000**. Later swap **BTC → ETH** when BTC is worth ₴700,000.
- The **swap is NOT taxed** (crypto-to-crypto exempt). No tax event yet; carry the **₴500,000** cost into the ETH position.
- Later sell **ETH for ₴900,000** fiat.
- Gain on the off-ramp = 900,000 − 500,000 = **₴400,000**.
- Tax (standard) = 400,000 × 23% = **₴92,000**. The intermediate swap is irrelevant to tax.

### Example D — Loss carry-forward
- Year 1: net virtual-asset result = **−₴150,000** (loss). Tax = 0; carry forward ₴150,000.
- Year 2: gross gain = **₴400,000**; apply carried loss → taxable = 400,000 − 150,000 = **₴250,000**.
- Tax = 250,000 × 23% = **₴57,500**.

### Example E — Undocumented cost basis
- Sold crypto for **₴300,000** but **no acquisition records**.
- Deductible cost = **₴0** → taxable base = **₴300,000**.
- Tax (standard) = 300,000 × 23% = **₴69,000**. (Records would have cut this sharply — see §7.)

## 7. Tier 2 catalogue — reviewer judgement, record-keeping, foreign holdings

These items require human reviewer judgement and/or are not fully settled in the draft. **Escalate to a qualified Ukrainian accountant.**

1. **In-force status (top priority).** Confirm the bill has passed the second reading, been signed and published, and verify the actual effective date and final rates before any computation.
2. **Cost-basis method.** FIFO vs weighted-average vs specific-ID is not unambiguous in public summaries — confirm the enacted method; apply consistently and document it.
3. **Staking timing.** Receipt vs disposal taxation is unsettled — get the final rule before advising stakers/validators.
4. **Business vs investor line.** Frequency, scale, organisation and intent determine whether mining/trading is FOP/corporate (out of scope here). Document the analysis.
5. **De-minimis threshold.** Confirm the minimum-monthly-wage exemption figure and whether it is per-transaction or per-year.
6. **Military levy under the 5% preferential rate.** Confirm whether the 5% levy applies, is reduced, or is waived in 2026.
7. **Record-keeping (decisive).** Keep, per asset and per transaction:
   - date, type (buy/sell/swap/transfer/reward), counterparty/exchange;
   - quantity, fiat value and the **UAH amount at the NBU rate** on that date;
   - acquisition documents (invoices, exchange statements, on-chain references);
   - running cost basis and method used.
   Without records, undocumented cost defaults to ₴0 (Example E).
8. **Foreign-exchange / foreign-held assets.** Crypto held on foreign exchanges or in self-custody abroad is still taxable in Ukraine for **Ukrainian tax residents** on worldwide income; consider currency-control, foreign-account reporting, and double-tax-treaty interaction. Confirm residency first.
9. **Interaction with the FOP simplified system.** Whether a FOP can run virtual-asset activity inside the єдиний податок regime is a separate question — route to **ua-single-tax** and confirm permitted activities.
10. **Anti-avoidance / wash sales.** Confirm whether the final law restricts loss harvesting via near-simultaneous repurchase.

## 8. Reference material + test suite

### Sources consulted (re-verify currency before use)
- **State Tax Service of Ukraine** — tax.gov.ua / dps.gov.ua (authority, declaration, Електронний кабінет).
- **Verkhovna Rada** — Draft Law **No. 10225-d**, "On Amendments to the Tax Code of Ukraine … Regulation of the Virtual Asset Market" (introduced 24 Apr 2025; first reading passed). Check the bill card on zakon.rada.gov.ua / w1.c1.rada.gov.ua for current status.
- **NSSMC (НКЦПФР)** — the "tax matrix" concept paper on virtual-asset taxation (token classes; mining/staking/airdrop options).
- **EY Ukraine** — IT/Tax/Law digest on the draft law (rates, taxable events, transition, declaration).
- **Global Legal Insights — Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Laws & Regulations 2026 (Ukraine).**
- **PwC / CMS / Lexology** crypto-tax commentary on the 2026 framework.
- Underlying 2022 **Law of Ukraine "On Virtual Assets"** (foundational definitions).

### Quick test suite (expected answers under the draft)
1. *Is selling BTC for UAH taxable?* → **Yes** (off-ramp; 18% PIT + 5% levy on the gain).
2. *Is swapping BTC for ETH taxable?* → **No** (crypto-to-crypto exempt); tax deferred to fiat conversion. (Verify provision survived.)
3. *Moving ETH between my own two wallets?* → **No** (no change of ownership).
4. *I bought BTC in 2021 and sell it in 2026 — what rate?* → **Preferential 5% PIT** (pre-law asset sold in the transition window) + 5% levy as described. Confirm levy treatment.
5. *I have no purchase records — what's my taxable base?* → **Full proceeds** (cost = ₴0).
6. *Net loss this year — is it wasted?* → **No** — carry forward to offset future crypto gains.
7. *Standard combined rate from 2027?* → **23%** (18% PIT + 5% military levy).
8. *Is the law definitely in force in 2026?* → **Not confirmed** — as of May 2026 only the first reading had passed; verify enactment before relying on anything.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT state the law is in force** or that 2026 figures are final unless you have **positively verified** enactment (second reading + signature + publication). Default to "draft / pending".
- **Do NOT fabricate** rates, thresholds, the de-minimis figure, carry-forward limits, the cost-basis method, or the levy treatment under the preferential rate. If the final text is unverified, say so and mark "verify current in-force status".
- **Do NOT advise a client to cash out legacy holdings in 2026 to capture the 5% rate** until enactment and eligibility are confirmed — premature action could be wrong if the law shifts.
- **Do NOT handle business-scale mining/trading or legal entities** here — that is FOP/corporate scope; route accordingly.
- **Do NOT give VAT, customs, social-contribution (ЄСВ), residency, or AML/currency-control conclusions** from this skill — those are out of scope; route to the relevant skill or a professional.
- **Do NOT skip the human reviewer.** This is YMYL content on a fast-moving, not-yet-final law.

## Disclaimer

This skill is **research-verified** against Ukrainian State Tax Service material, the Verkhovna Rada bill record for Draft Law No. 10225-d, NSSMC commentary, and Big-4/legal analysis — but it describes a **new and fast-moving law that, as of May 2026, had passed only the first reading and was not confirmed in force.** Every rate, threshold and rule is therefore **provisional** and may change before (or after) enactment. Nothing here is legal or tax advice. It **must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Ukrainian accountant, auditor or tax adviser**, and the current in-force status must be re-checked on tax.gov.ua and the Verkhovna Rada bill card before use.
