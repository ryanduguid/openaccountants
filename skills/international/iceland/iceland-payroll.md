# Iceland Payroll Skill v0.1

> Tier 2 (research-verified). Core 2025 figures (tax brackets, personal tax credit, tryggingagjald) are drawn directly from Skatturinn (Iceland Revenue and Customs) key-rates and tax-bracket pages and corroborated by PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries. The state-vs-municipal split of each bracket is approximate (Skatturinn publishes only the COMBINED withholding rate); the exact late-payment surcharge on staðgreiðsla/tryggingagjald and the minimum-wage figures (which are NOT statutory) are flagged as research gaps below. An Iceland-registered accountant must confirm against the official Skatturinn rate tables and the applicable collective agreement (kjarasamningur) before sign-off.

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (PAYE / staðgreiðsla)

Iceland levies personal income tax that COMBINES a **state income tax** and a **municipal income tax**. The employer withholds the combined tax monthly under "staðgreiðsla": it applies the three-bracket schedule to the period's taxable base, then subtracts the employee's monthly **personal tax credit (persónuafsláttur)** (Lög nr. 45/1987; Skatturinn tax brackets 2025).

There are **no marital-status / married-vs-single scales** in Iceland — the same progressive scale and the same per-person credit apply to every individual. Unused personal credit is carried forward within the year and up to 100% transferable to a spouse (Skatturinn).

### Combined Withholding Bracket Table -- 2025 (per MONTH of taxable income)

| Bracket | Monthly taxable income (ISK) | Combined rate | Tax on band (ISK) | Cumulative tax at top of band (ISK) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 -- 472,005 | 31.49% | 148,634.37 | 148,634.37 |
| 2 | 472,006 -- 1,325,127 | 37.99% | 324,101.05 | 472,735.42 |
| 3 | over 1,325,127 | 46.29% | -- | (472,735.42 + 46.29% of excess over 1,325,127) |

Source: Skatturinn, "Tax brackets 2025" and "Key rates and amounts 2025". Cumulative recomputed: 472,005 × 31.49% = 148,634.37; bracket-2 band width 1,325,127 − 472,005 = 853,122 × 37.99% = 324,101.05 (→ 472,735.42 cumulative at top of bracket 2). The combined rate = state component + municipal component (see split below). The personal tax credit is applied AFTER computing this gross tax.

### State / municipal split of each bracket (approximate)

| Bracket | Combined | State component (approx) | Municipal component (withholding average) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 31.49% | ~16.55% | 14.94% |
| 2 | 37.99% | ~23.05% | 14.94% |
| 3 | 46.29% | ~31.35% | 14.94% |

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (state/municipal split). Skatturinn publishes only the COMBINED rate, so the state-component figures are APPROXIMATE. Withholding always uses the 14.94% average municipal rate; the **final assessed municipal rate ranges 12.44%–14.94% by municipality** and is trued up at the annual assessment (Skatturinn; PwC). Using the maximum municipal rate at withholding avoids under-withholding.

### Personal tax credit (persónuafsláttur)

| Year | Per month (ISK) | Per year (ISK) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | 68,691 | 824,288 | Skatturinn "Key rates and amounts 2025" |
| 2026 | 72,492 | 869,898 | Skatturinn "Key rates and amounts 2026" |

Available to residents aged 16+. The monthly figure × 12 (824,292 for 2025; 869,904 for 2026) differs by a few ISK from Skatturinn's published annual figure (824,288 / 869,898) — Skatturinn publishes both independently; use the monthly figure for monthly withholding and the annual figure at year-end assessment. Unused credit carries forward within the year and up to 100% transfers to a spouse (Skatturinn).

### PAYE Computation Method (staðgreiðsla)

1. Start from gross remuneration for the period.
2. **Deduct the employee's mandatory pension contribution (4%)** — it is deductible from the income-tax base (PwC). This gives the **taxable base**.
3. Apply the combined bracket table to the taxable base to get **gross monthly income tax**.
4. **Subtract the monthly personal tax credit** (persónuafsláttur). If gross tax < credit, income tax withheld = 0 and the unused credit carries forward within the year (or transfers to a spouse).
5. The result is the income tax withheld for the period; net pay = gross − pension − income tax.

Iceland's staðgreiðsla applies the schedule to each period's pay (not a full-year cumulative projection like UK PAYE); the annual assessment (álagning) trues up state/municipal differences and any unused/over-used credit.

## Section 3 -- Social Contributions -- Employee Deductions

The only mandatory employee deduction besides income tax is the **mandatory occupational pension (lífeyrissjóður)** at **4%** minimum. There is **no employee tryggingagjald** — the social security contribution is employer-only.

### Employee Contribution Rates (2025)

| Contribution | Rate | Base | Floor | Ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory pension (employee) | 4% (minimum) | Total wages | none | none | Withheld by employer; **deductible** from the income-tax base (PwC) |
| Supplementary private pension (séreignarsparnaður) -- OPTIONAL | up to 4% | Wages | none | none | Voluntary; **deductible**; employer commonly matches up to 2% under collective agreements (PwC) |
| **Total mandatory employee deduction (pension)** | **4%** | -- | -- | -- | Plus PAYE income tax on top |

Sources: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Iceland Individual: Other taxes. The 4% mandatory employee pension is the statutory minimum under Lög nr. 129/1997; collective agreements (kjarasamningar) may set a higher rate — confirm per the applicable agreement.

> Iceland has NO employee-side social security tax. tryggingagjald (Section 4) is paid solely by the employer.

---

## Section 4 -- Social Contributions -- Employer Contributions

Employers pay (a) the social security contribution **tryggingagjald** and (b) the **employer mandatory pension** (11.5% minimum). tryggingagjald is employer-only with **no floor and no ceiling**.

### Employer Contribution Rates (2025)

| Contribution | Rate | Base | Floor | Ceiling | Who |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| tryggingagjald (general rate) | 6.35% | Total gross remuneration (wages, salaries, benefits, calculated remuneration of self-employed) | none | none | Employer only |
| Mandatory pension (employer) | 11.5% (minimum) | Total wages | none | none | Employer |
| **Total standard employer load** | **17.85%** | -- | -- | -- | -- |

Sources: tryggingagjald general rate 6.35% — Skatturinn "Key rates and amounts" 2025 & 2026, corroborated by PwC Corporate: Other taxes. Employer mandatory pension 11.5% minimum (total minimum 15.5% with the 4% employee share) — PwC Individual: Other taxes; Lög nr. 129/1997. **Arithmetic check (employer column):** 6.35% + 11.5% = **17.85%**.

### tryggingagjald rate variants

| Variant | Rate | Applies to | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| General rate | 6.35% | All standard employment | Skatturinn 2025/2026; PwC |
| Fishermen / seamen surcharge | +0.65% (≈7.00% total) | Gross wages of seamen | PwC Corporate: Other taxes |
| A1 (posted EEA worker) reduced rate | 0.425% | Gross wages where worker covered under an A1 certificate in the home country | PwC Corporate: Other taxes |

> Several EOR/payroll-vendor blogs cite 6.85% or 6.90% for tryggingagjald — these appear stale or to aggregate sub-components. The authoritative **6.35%** general rate (Skatturinn 2025 & 2026; PwC) is used throughout this skill.

### Combined Employer + Employee Snapshot (standard case)

| Party | Components | Rate of gross |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | Mandatory pension 4% | 4% (+ PAYE income tax) |
| Employer | tryggingagjald 6.35% + mandatory pension 11.5% | 17.85% |
| **Total pension (employee + employer)** | 4% + 11.5% | **15.5% minimum** (Lög nr. 129/1997) |

### Employer pension contributions taxable to the employee

Employer pension contributions become **taxable income to the employee only where they exceed BOTH 12% of remuneration AND ISK 2,000,000 per year** (PwC). Below either threshold they are tax-free to the employee.

---

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage and Hiring Mechanics

### Minimum Wage -- there is NO statutory minimum wage

Iceland has **no statutory minimum wage**. Minimum pay is set by **collective bargaining agreements (kjarasamningar)** covering approximately 88–90% of the workforce.

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Statutory minimum wage | None — set by collective agreement | (no statute) |
| Lowest negotiated full-time monthly minimum (2025, approx) | ISK 425,985 – 454,977 depending on agreement/sector (e.g. SGS / Efling / VR) | Secondary (Playroll / VR union) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the specific kjarasamningur |

> Always confirm the applicable collective agreement (kjarasamningur) — it varies by union/sector and updates mid-contract via wage-drift clauses. Do NOT treat the figure above as a fixed statutory floor.

### Hiring and Registration

| Step | Detail | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Employer registration | Register on the employer registry (launagreiðendaskrá) via **form RSK 5.02** at least **8 days before** the first wage payment / start of operations | Skatturinn |
| VAT registration (if relevant) | Register if turnover exceeds ISK 2,000,000 per 12 months (standard VAT 24% / reduced 11%) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the ISK 2,000,000 figure against Skatturinn VAT pages (secondary source) | Skatturinn |

There is no minimum employee count or wage threshold for payroll registration — withholding and tryggingagjald apply from the first wage payment.

---

## Section 6 -- Other Taxable / Special Categories

| Category | Treatment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains, rent) | Flat **22%**. ISK 300,000 per person of interest/dividend income from regulated securities is tax-free; 50% of residential rental income is tax-free (max two properties) | Skatturinn 2025 |
| Children born 2010 or later | Annual income exceeding **ISK 180,000** taxed at a flat **6%** (no personal credit) | Skatturinn 2025 |
| Non-resident directors'/committee members' fees | **20% state + 14.94% municipal = 34.94%** | PwC |
| RÚV broadcasting fee | ISK 21,400 (2025) levied annually on individuals with income above ISK 2,474,942 — collected via the tax ASSESSMENT, **not** payroll withholding | Skatturinn / island.is |

Capital income, the broadcasting fee and self-employed calculated remuneration are NOT processed through this employer-payroll skill except where they affect an employee's overall position.

---

## Section 7 -- Conservative Defaults

When inputs are missing or ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag for the accountant:

1. **Combined withholding rates.** Use 31.49% / 37.99% / 46.29% (state + 14.94% average municipal) on monthly taxable income bands 0–472,005 / 472,006–1,325,127 / over 1,325,127 ISK. The final municipal rate varies 12.44%–14.94% by municipality; withholding ALWAYS uses 14.94% and the true-up happens at the annual assessment, so under-withholding is avoided.
2. **tryggingagjald = 6.35% general rate.** Confirmed by Skatturinn 2025 & 2026 and PwC. Ignore the higher 6.85%/6.90% figures from EOR blogs (likely stale/aggregated). Apply the 0.65% seamen surcharge or 0.425% A1 rate only when the engagement confirms those facts.
3. **Mandatory pension = 4% employee + 11.5% employer (minimum 15.5%).** Actual rate may be higher under the applicable collective agreement — confirm per kjarasamningur.
4. **Pension is deductible before income tax.** Deduct the 4% employee pension from gross before applying the bracket table.
5. **Personal tax credit.** Apply the full monthly persónuafsláttur (ISK 68,691 for 2025) to the PRIMARY employer only; carry forward of unused credit within the year is allowed. Do not over-credit across multiple employers.
6. **Year-correct figures.** Use 2025 brackets and credit (68,691/mo) for 2025 pay periods; use the 2026 figures (brackets at 498,122 / 1,398,450; credit 72,492/mo) only for 2026 pay periods.
7. **No statutory minimum wage.** Do not assume a floor; flag that minimum pay depends on the collective agreement.

## Section 8 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs (refuse to finalise a payroll run without these)

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Pay period and pay date (and calendar year) | Determines whether 2025 or 2026 brackets/credit apply |
| Gross remuneration for the period (and annualised) | Base for the bracket calc and all contributions |
| Employee residency/age status (resident 16+?) | Determines entitlement to the personal tax credit |
| Whether this is the employee's PRIMARY employer | Personal credit applies to the primary employer only; avoids over-crediting |
| Mandatory pension rate per collective agreement | 4% is the statutory minimum; the agreement may set higher |
| Unused personal-credit carry-forward (and any spouse transfer) | Adjusts the credit actually applied |
| Sector facts (seaman? A1-certificated posted worker?) | Selects the tryggingagjald variant (7.00% / 0.425%) |
| kennitala (national ID) / employer registration on launagreiðendaskrá | Required to withhold and file |

### Refusal Catalogue (stop and ask, do not guess)

- **Pay date year unknown** → refuse; cannot choose 2025 vs 2026 brackets/credit.
- **Personal-credit status unknown / multiple employers** → flag; apply the full monthly credit only to the confirmed primary employer.
- **Mandatory pension rate not confirmed** → default to the 4%/11.5% statutory minimum and flag that the collective agreement may be higher.
- **Seaman / A1 status claimed without evidence** → default to the 6.35% general tryggingagjald rate; do not silently apply 7.00% or 0.425%.
- **Employer not registered on launagreiðendaskrá** → refuse to run payroll; registration (RSK 5.02) is required at least 8 days before the first wage payment.
- **Capital income / self-employed calculated remuneration** → out of scope for this employer-payroll skill; redirect.

## Section 9 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic classification of Iceland bank-statement lines. Icelandic and English descriptors both appear.

### Salary Credits (employee side)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| LAUN, ÚTBORGUÐ LAUN, MÁNAÐARLAUN, SALARY, PAYROLL | Net salary payment |
| EMPLOYER [name] / VINNUVEITANDI, WAGES | Net salary payment |
| BÓNUS, BONUS, DESEMBERUPPBÓT, ORLOFSUPPBÓT | Bonus / holiday & December supplement (taxable) |
| ENDURGREIÐSLA SKATTS, TAX REFUND | Income-tax true-up refund — not current income |

### Employer Debits (employer side)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| SKATTURINN STAÐGREIÐSLA, STAÐGREIÐSLA, PAYE | Income tax (staðgreiðsla) remittance to Skatturinn |
| TRYGGINGAGJALD, SKATTURINN TRYGGINGAGJALD | Employer social security contribution remittance |
| LÍFEYRISSJÓÐUR, PENSION FUND, [fund name] | Mandatory + supplementary pension remittance to the pension fund |
| SÉREIGN, SÉREIGNARSPARNAÐUR | Supplementary private pension remittance |
| STÉTTARFÉLAG, FÉLAGSGJALD, UNION | Union dues withheld and remitted |
| LAUNAGREIÐSLA, SALARY RUN, PAYROLL BATCH | Salary disbursement to employees |

> Income tax (staðgreiðsla) and tryggingagjald are remitted together to Skatturinn on the same monthly cycle; pension contributions are remitted separately to the relevant pension fund(s). Confirm the actual split with the employer's payment records.

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All examples use 2025 brackets, the 2025 personal credit (ISK 68,691/month), the statutory minimum pension (4% employee / 11.5% employer) and the general tryggingagjald rate (6.35%). The 4% employee pension is deducted before the income-tax base. Figures recomputed end-to-end; rounding to the cent (ISK shown to 2 dp for transparency — in practice rounded to whole ISK).

### Example 1 -- Standard monthly employee, ISK 600,000/month

| Step | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly remuneration | 600,000.00 |
| Employee mandatory pension 4% | 24,000.00 |
| Taxable base = 600,000 − 24,000 | 576,000.00 |
| Gross tax: 472,005 × 31.49% (148,634.37) + (576,000 − 472,005) × 37.99% (103,995 × 37.99% = 39,507.71) | 188,142.08 |
| Less personal tax credit | 68,691.00 |
| **Income tax withheld** | **119,451.08** |
| **Net pay** = 600,000 − 24,000 − 119,451.08 | **456,548.93** |

Employer cost: tryggingagjald 6.35% (38,100.00) + employer pension 11.5% (69,000.00) = 107,100.00; total employer outlay = 600,000 + 107,100 = **707,100.00/month**.

### Example 2 -- Lower earner, ISK 400,000/month (bracket 1 only)

| Step | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly remuneration | 400,000.00 |
| Employee mandatory pension 4% | 16,000.00 |
| Taxable base = 400,000 − 16,000 | 384,000.00 |
| Gross tax: 384,000 × 31.49% (all in bracket 1) | 120,921.60 |
| Less personal tax credit | 68,691.00 |
| **Income tax withheld** | **52,230.60** |
| **Net pay** = 400,000 − 16,000 − 52,230.60 | **331,769.40** |

Employer cost: tryggingagjald 25,400.00 + employer pension 46,000.00 = 71,400.00; total employer outlay = **471,400.00/month**.

### Example 3 -- Top-bracket earner, ISK 1,800,000/month

| Step | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly remuneration | 1,800,000.00 |
| Employee mandatory pension 4% | 72,000.00 |
| Taxable base = 1,800,000 − 72,000 | 1,728,000.00 |
| Gross tax — bracket 1: 472,005 × 31.49% | 148,634.37 |
| Gross tax — bracket 2: 853,122 × 37.99% | 324,101.05 |
| Gross tax — bracket 3: (1,728,000 − 1,325,127) = 402,873 × 46.29% | 186,489.91 |
| Total gross tax | 659,225.33 |
| Less personal tax credit | 68,691.00 |
| **Income tax withheld** | **590,534.33** |
| **Net pay** = 1,800,000 − 72,000 − 590,534.33 | **1,137,465.67** |

Employer cost: tryggingagjald 114,300.00 + employer pension 207,000.00 = 321,300.00; total employer outlay = **2,121,300.00/month**.

### Example 4 -- Near collective-agreement minimum, ISK 450,000/month

| Step | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly remuneration | 450,000.00 |
| Employee mandatory pension 4% | 18,000.00 |
| Taxable base = 450,000 − 18,000 | 432,000.00 |
| Gross tax: 432,000 × 31.49% (bracket 1) | 136,036.80 |
| Less personal tax credit | 68,691.00 |
| **Income tax withheld** | **67,345.80** |
| **Net pay** = 450,000 − 18,000 − 67,345.80 | **364,654.20** |

ISK 450,000 sits within the approximate 2025 collective-minimum band (ISK 425,985–454,977) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the applicable kjarasamningur. Employer cost: tryggingagjald 28,575.00 + employer pension 51,750.00 = 80,325.00; total employer outlay = **530,325.00/month**.

### Example 5 -- Low earner where the credit fully absorbs the tax, ISK 220,000/month

| Step | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly remuneration | 220,000.00 |
| Employee mandatory pension 4% | 8,800.00 |
| Taxable base = 220,000 − 8,800 | 211,200.00 |
| Gross tax: 211,200 × 31.49% | 66,506.88 |
| Less personal tax credit (66,506.88 < 68,691) | 68,691.00 |
| **Income tax withheld** (cannot go below 0) | **0.00** |
| Unused credit carried forward within the year | 2,184.12 |
| **Net pay** = 220,000 − 8,800 − 0 | **211,200.00** |

When gross tax is below the personal credit, no income tax is withheld and the unused credit (here 2,184.12) carries forward within the year or transfers to a spouse.

### Example 6 -- Child (born 2010 or later) flat-6% case

Annual income of ISK 500,000 earned by a child born in 2012 → taxed at a flat **6% with no personal credit** = 500,000 × 6% = **ISK 30,000** (Skatturinn 2025). The 6% applies to income above the ISK 180,000 annual threshold; **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether the 6% applies to the whole amount or only the excess over 180,000 in the year in question.

## Section 11 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply directly)

1. Income tax is withheld monthly under staðgreiðsla, combining a state and a municipal income tax (Lög nr. 45/1987; Skatturinn).
2. 2025 combined withholding brackets (monthly taxable income): 31.49% on 0–472,005; 37.99% on 472,006–1,325,127; 46.29% above 1,325,127 ISK (Skatturinn "Tax brackets 2025").
3. Withholding uses the average municipal rate 14.94%; the final assessed municipal rate ranges 12.44%–14.94% by municipality and is trued up at the annual assessment (Skatturinn; PwC).
4. 2025 personal tax credit (persónuafsláttur) = ISK 68,691/month (ISK 824,288/year), deducted from monthly gross tax for residents 16+; unused credit carries forward within the year and up to 100% transfers to a spouse (Skatturinn).
5. The 4% employee mandatory pension is deducted from gross BEFORE computing the income-tax base (PwC; conservative default).
6. Employer social security contribution (tryggingagjald) general rate = 6.35% of total gross remuneration, employer-only, no floor and no ceiling (Skatturinn 2025 & 2026; PwC).
7. tryggingagjald adds 0.65% for fishermen/seamen (≈7.00% total) and has a reduced 0.425% component for A1-certificated posted EEA workers (PwC).
8. Mandatory occupational pension: minimum 15.5% of wages = 4% employee (withheld, deductible) + 11.5% employer; collective agreements may set higher employer rates (Lög nr. 129/1997; PwC).
9. Optional supplementary private pension (séreignarsparnaður): employee may contribute up to 4% (deductible); employers commonly match up to 2% under collective agreements (PwC).
10. Employer pension contributions become taxable to the employee only where they exceed BOTH 12% of remuneration AND ISK 2,000,000/year (PwC).
11. Capital income (interest, dividends, gains, rent) is taxed at a flat 22%; ISK 300,000/person of interest/dividend income from regulated securities is tax-free; 50% of residential rental income is tax-free (max two properties) (Skatturinn 2025).
12. Iceland has NO statutory minimum wage; minimum pay is set by collective agreements covering ~88–90% of workers (verify the applicable kjarasamningur).
13. Employers must register on launagreiðendaskrá via form RSK 5.02 at least 8 days before the first wage payment / start of operations (Skatturinn).
14. Monthly PAYE return (skilagreining) and tryggingagjald are reported and paid by the 15th of the month following the wage month (Skatturinn; Lög nr. 45/1987).
15. Under-withholding identified at the annual assessment is collected increased by 2.5% of the difference; over-withholding is refunded (PwC Individual: Tax administration).
16. Children born 2010 or later are taxed at a flat 6% on annual income exceeding ISK 180,000, with no personal credit (Skatturinn 2025).
17. Non-resident directors'/committee members' fees are taxed at 20% state + 14.94% municipal = 34.94% (PwC).
18. The individual annual return (framtal) is due 14 March of the year following the tax year; the final assessment (álagning) is generally completed by 31 May (PwC; Skatturinn).

## Section 12 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These require professional judgement — flag for the Iceland-registered accountant rather than auto-deciding:

| Topic | Judgement call |
|---|---|
| Applicable collective agreement (kjarasamningur) | Which agreement/sector applies, the actual minimum wage, and any higher mandatory pension rate. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the specific agreement. |
| State/municipal split & municipality rate | The employee's municipality of residence sets the final municipal rate (12.44%–14.94%); the state-component split is approximate (PwC). True-up at assessment. |
| Personal-credit allocation | Allocation of the personal credit across multiple employers / spouse transfer / carry-forward within the year. |
| Supplementary pension match | Whether the employer matches séreignarsparnaður (commonly up to 2%) and the deductibility position. |
| Employer pension >12% / >ISK 2m test | Whether employer pension contributions cross BOTH thresholds and become taxable to the employee. |
| Benefits in kind | Valuation of non-cash benefits in the tryggingagjald and income-tax base. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** current BIK valuation rules. |
| Late-payment surcharge | The exact álag and dráttarvextir on overdue staðgreiðsla / tryggingagjald. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the current percentage under Lög nr. 45/1987 / Skatturinn. |
| Seaman / A1 status | Whether the 7.00% seamen surcharge or the 0.425% A1 reduced rate applies. |

## Section 13 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Recommended columns for a monthly Iceland payroll working paper (one row per employee):

| Column | Formula / source |
|---|---|
| A. Employee name | input |
| B. kennitala (national ID) | input |
| C. Pay date / period | input (drives 2025 vs 2026 rules) |
| D. Primary employer? (Y/N) | input (controls personal credit) |
| E. Monthly gross remuneration | input |
| F. Employee mandatory pension 4% | = E × 4% (or agreement rate) |
| G. Taxable base | = E − F |
| H. Gross income tax | = bracket function on G (2025 or 2026 table) |
| I. Personal tax credit applied | = if D = Y then MIN(H, 68,691) else 0 (2025) / 72,492 (2026), adjusted for carry-forward |
| J. Income tax withheld | = MAX(H − I, 0) |
| K. Unused credit carry-forward | = MAX(I_entitlement − H, 0) |
| L. Monthly net pay | = E − F − J |
| M. Employer tryggingagjald | = E × 6.35% (or 7.00% seamen / 0.425% A1) |
| N. Employer mandatory pension 11.5% | = E × 11.5% (or agreement rate) |
| O. Supplementary pension (employee/employer) | = optional per agreement |
| P. Total employer cost | = E + M + N + (employer O) |

Build the bracket function (column H) as a nested IF or a lookup against the correct year's table from Section 2. Always recompute the cumulative band tax from the table — do not hard-code per-employee tax. The 14.94% withholding municipal rate is baked into the combined bracket rates; the assessment true-up is handled by Skatturinn, not the working paper.

## Section 15 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you cannot establish enough to compute payroll, gather in this order and stop where blocked:

1. **Calendar year + pay date** — selects 2025 vs 2026 brackets and credit.
2. **Monthly gross remuneration** + whether any December/holiday supplement or bonus applies.
3. **Residency/age status (resident 16+?)** — credit entitlement.
4. **Primary employer? + any unused credit carry-forward / spouse transfer** — credit allocation.
5. **Applicable collective agreement** — minimum wage and mandatory pension rate (4% may be higher).
6. **Sector facts** — seaman (7.00% tryggingagjald) or A1-certificated posted worker (0.425%).
7. **Employer registration on launagreiðendaskrá (RSK 5.02)** — confirm registered before running payroll.

If the engagement turns out to be a self-employed person (reiknað endurgjald / calculated remuneration) or pure capital income, stop: this employer-payroll skill does not cover those.

## Section 17 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (staðgreiðsla + tryggingagjald + pension) | **This skill (iceland-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed income tax / calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) | iceland self-employed / income-tax skill |
| Iceland VAT returns | iceland-vat skill |
| Iceland bookkeeping | iceland-bookkeeping skill |
| Employer corporate tax | iceland-corporate-tax skill |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages, employer tryggingagjald and employer pension are expenses; withheld income tax (staðgreiðsla) and employee pension are liabilities until remitted to Skatturinn / the pension fund.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** The launamiði / annual wage statement feeds the employee's pre-filled framtal (due 14 March following year); the assessment trues up the state/municipal split and any unused personal credit.
- **Payroll → Pension:** Mandatory contributions count toward the employee's pension entitlement under Lög nr. 129/1997; supplementary séreignarsparnaður is a separate private account.

### Research Caveats (read before relying on figures)

- Confidence is **high** for the core 2025 payroll mechanics; brackets, personal credit and tryggingagjald are corroborated by Skatturinn AND PwC.
- **tryggingagjald rate:** Skatturinn (2025 & 2026 key rates) and PwC both state the general employer rate is **6.35%**. Several EOR/payroll vendor blogs cite 6.85% or 6.90% — these appear stale or to aggregate sub-components; the authoritative 6.35% is used here.
- **State-vs-municipal split** (16.55 / 23.05 / 31.35% state) is from PwC; Skatturinn publishes only the COMBINED rate, so the state-component figures are approximate and the municipal 14.94% is the withholding average (final municipal rate 12.44%–14.94% by municipality).
- **Minimum wage is NOT statutory.** Figures (≈ISK 425,985–454,977/month for 2025) come from secondary sources (Playroll, VR union) and must be confirmed against the specific applicable collective agreement (kjarasamningur), which varies by union/sector and updates mid-contract.
- The exact current **late-payment surcharge** on withholding tax / tryggingagjald (álag and dráttarvextir under Lög nr. 45/1987) was not confirmed from an authoritative English source — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**. The 2.5% under-withholding add-on and the VAT 1%/day-to-10% figures are documented but the staðgreiðsla-specific surcharge needs verification.
- The **VAT registration threshold (ISK 2,000,000)** is from secondary sources and should be confirmed against Skatturinn VAT pages if relevant.
- **Bracket annual figures** are derived by ×12 of the published monthly thresholds (Skatturinn publishes withholding thresholds monthly). The personal credit monthly × 12 (824,292) differs by a few ISK from the published annual (824,288); use the figure appropriate to the calculation.
- **2026 figures** are officially confirmed by Skatturinn and noted, but the skill's primary tax year is 2025.

## Section 19 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputed end-to-end; expected values reconcile to the cent (2025 brackets, credit ISK 68,691/month, 4% employee / 11.5% employer pension, 6.35% tryggingagjald).

1. **Bracket-1 band tax.** 472,005 × 31.49% = **148,634.37** (full bracket-1 band tax).
2. **Bracket-2 cumulative.** Top of bracket 2 = 148,634.37 + (1,325,127 − 472,005) × 37.99% = 148,634.37 + 853,122 × 37.99% (324,101.05) = **472,735.42**.
3. **Standard employee net.** Gross 600,000 → pension 24,000; base 576,000; gross tax 188,142.08; less credit 68,691 → income tax **119,451.08**; net **456,548.93**.
4. **Lower earner.** Gross 400,000 → pension 16,000; base 384,000; gross tax 120,921.60; less credit → income tax **52,230.60**; net **331,769.40**.
5. **Top bracket.** Gross 1,800,000 → pension 72,000; base 1,728,000; gross tax 148,634.37 + 324,101.05 + (1,728,000 − 1,325,127) × 46.29% (186,489.91) = 659,225.33; less credit → income tax **590,534.33**; net **1,137,465.67**.
6. **Credit fully absorbs tax.** Gross 220,000 → pension 8,800; base 211,200; gross tax 66,506.88 < credit 68,691 → income tax **0.00**; unused credit carried forward **2,184.12**; net **211,200.00**.
7. **Employer load.** Gross 600,000 → tryggingagjald 6.35% = **38,100.00**; employer pension 11.5% = **69,000.00**; total employer cost **707,100.00**.
8. **tryggingagjald is employer-only.** A 600,000 gross employee has NO tryggingagjald deduction on the employee side — the only employee deduction besides income tax is the 4% pension (24,000.00).
9. **Pension is deductible before tax.** Gross 400,000 → taxable base is 384,000 (after 4% pension), NOT 400,000 — gross tax computed on 384,000.
10. **Total pension minimum.** Employee 4% + employer 11.5% = **15.5%** of wages (statutory minimum, Lög nr. 129/1997).
11. **Non-resident director.** Fee ISK 1,000,000 → 1,000,000 × 34.94% = **349,400.00** (20% state + 14.94% municipal).
12. **Child flat rate.** Child born 2012, annual income 500,000 → 500,000 × 6% = **30,000.00** (no personal credit). **[RESEARCH GAP]** whether 6% applies to the whole amount or only the excess over ISK 180,000.
13. **2026 bracket switch.** A pay period dated 15 Jan 2026 uses the 2026 brackets (bracket-1 ceiling 498,122) and the 2026 credit (72,492/month), NOT the 2025 figures.
14. **Registration refusal.** Employer not on launagreiðendaskrá → refuse to run payroll; RSK 5.02 registration is required at least 8 days before the first wage payment.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER add tryggingagjald as an EMPLOYEE deduction — it is employer-only (6.35%); the only mandatory employee deduction besides income tax is the 4% pension.
- NEVER compute income tax on gross before deducting the 4% mandatory pension — pension is deductible from the income-tax base.
- NEVER use a tryggingagjald rate other than 6.35% (general) without confirmed seaman (7.00%) or A1 (0.425%) status — ignore the stale 6.85%/6.90% EOR figures.
- NEVER apply the full personal tax credit to more than one employer — it goes to the primary employer only; carry forward unused credit within the year.
- NEVER assume a statutory minimum wage — Iceland has none; minimum pay depends on the applicable collective agreement (kjarasamningur).
- NEVER use the average 14.94% municipal rate as the FINAL rate — it is the withholding rate; the assessed rate (12.44%–14.94%) is trued up at assessment.
- NEVER use the 2025 brackets/credit for a 2026 pay period (or vice versa).
- NEVER miss the 15th-of-following-month deadline for the staðgreiðsla return and tryggingagjald — surcharge and interest apply.
- NEVER state an unverified late-payment surcharge percentage — it is a documented research gap; direct the user to confirm with Skatturinn / the statute.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to an Iceland-registered accountant.
