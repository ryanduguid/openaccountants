### Tax Rate Brackets — 2025 (combined state income tax + average municipal útsvar; withholding rates)

These are the **withholding (staðgreiðsla) rates** applied monthly at source. The municipal component (útsvar) is embedded in each combined rate (Skatturinn, Tax-brackets 2025).

| Bracket | Monthly income (ISK) | Annual income (ISK) | Combined rate | Cumulative tax at bracket top (monthly, before personal credit) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 – 472,005 | 0 – ~5,664,060 | 31.49% | ISK 148,634.37 |
| 2 | 472,006 – 1,325,127 | ~5,664,072 – ~15,901,524 | 37.99% | ISK 472,735.42 |
| 3 | over 1,325,127 | over ~15,901,524 | 46.29% | — |

Source: Skatturinn, [Tax-brackets 2025](https://www.skatturinn.is/english/individuals/tax-brackets/2025/). Annual thresholds are arithmetic 12× the official monthly figures (Skatturinn publishes monthly). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the state vs útsvar split inside the combined rates; Skatturinn does not itemise it on the brackets page.

**Cumulative tax check (monthly):** Bracket 1 top = 472,005 × 31.49% = **148,634.37**. Bracket 2 top = 148,634.37 + (1,325,127 − 472,005) × 37.99% = 148,634.37 + 853,122 × 37.99% = 148,634.37 + 324,101.05 = **472,735.42**.

### Personal Tax Credit (persónuafsláttur) — 2025

| Item | Monthly (ISK) | Annual (ISK) |
|---|---|---|
| Personal tax credit | 68,691 | 824,288 |

Subtracted from **computed tax** (not from income). Unused portion is transferable between spouses. Source: Skatturinn, [Key rates and amounts 2025](https://www.skatturinn.is/english/individuals/key-rates-and-amounts/2025/). (PwC/island.is round-figure cited as 824,292 — use the Skatturinn figure 824,288.)

### Other Income-Tax Rates — 2025

| Item | Rate | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capital income tax (fjármagnstekjuskattur) | 22% (flat) | Capital gains (real estate, shares), dividends, interest. First ISK 300,000/yr of interest + shareholding income per person is tax-free. | Skatturinn key rates 2025 |
| Municipal tax component (útsvar) | 14.94% withheld; 12.44%–14.94% final by municipality | Embedded in combined bracket rates; final depends on residence municipality. | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Directors'/committee fees | 20% income tax + municipal tax | Special withholding category. | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Children born 2010 or later | 6% | On a child's income exceeding ISK 180,000/yr. | Skatturinn key rates 2025 |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown municipal tax rate | Use 14.94% (max/withholding rate); final assessment may be lower (PwC) |
| Unknown tryggingagjald rate | Use 6.35% general rate (Skatturinn / PwC) |
| Unknown minimum wage | No statutory minimum — confirm the applicable collective agreement; do NOT hard-code a figure |
| Unknown self-employed remuneration | STOP — calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) must be set at market salary per Skatturinn's occupation table |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT (VSK) registration status | Assume registered if 12-month turnover > ISK 2,000,000; otherwise unregistered |
| Unknown residency | STOP — non-resident rules differ |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full income year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residency status (resident/non-resident), employment status (employee vs self-employed sole proprietor), and (for self-employed) the occupation category for calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, monthly staðgreiðsla (withholding) records, pension fund (lífeyrissjóður) statements, prior-year skattframtal (RSK 1.01) or assessment (álagning), VAT (VSK) registration confirmation.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account (rekstrarframtal RSK 4.11), asset register, A1 certificate (if EEA worker), municipality of residence, spousal income (for personal-credit transfer).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the self-employed calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) meets Skatturinn's minimum for the occupation category."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-IS-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether Icelandic worldwide-income rules or limited non-resident rules apply. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming the client is resident in Iceland. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-IS-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and sole proprietors (einstaklingar / sjálfstætt starfandi) only. Limited companies (ehf./hf.) and partnerships file separate corporate returns. Escalate to an Icelandic accountant."

**R-IS-3 -- Calculated remuneration below occupation minimum.** "Self-employed individuals must declare calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) at the market salary level set in Skatturinn's annual occupation table. A figure below that minimum cannot be used. Escalate to confirm the correct category figure." (Skatturinn reiknað endurgjald table — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact 2025 category amounts; not extracted in research.)

**R-IS-4 -- Capital gains on property / shares.** "Capital gains computations (real-estate disposals, share sales) under the 22% capital income regime require specialised analysis of cost base and exemptions. Escalate to an Icelandic accountant."

**R-IS-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to Skatturinn collection. Late-payment interest (dráttarvextir) and the 2.5% assessment adjustment apply. Do not advise. Escalate to an Icelandic accountant immediately."

**R-IS-6 -- VAT (VSK) return requested.** "This skill covers income tax only. For Icelandic VAT (VSK), use the iceland-vat skill if available; otherwise escalate."

**R-IS-7 -- Cross-border / A1 / expat.** "EEA postings, A1 social-security certificates, and double-tax-treaty relief require cross-border analysis. Escalate to an Icelandic accountant."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All tax figures use the 2025 combined withholding brackets (31.49% / 37.99% / 46.29%) and the monthly personal tax credit of ISK 68,691 (Skatturinn). Arithmetic is recomputed end-to-end below.

### Example 1 -- Employee monthly withholding (single bracket)

**Input line:**
`25.01.2025 ; LANDSBANKINN ; LAUN — VINNUVEITANDI EHF ; +550,000.00 ; ISK`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly wage of ISK 550,000. Falls in brackets 1 and 2 (over 472,005).
- Bracket 1: 472,005 × 31.49% = 148,634.37
- Bracket 2: (550,000 − 472,005) = 77,995 × 37.99% = 29,630.30
- Gross tax = 178,264.67; less personal credit 68,691 = **net withholding 109,573.67**.

**Classification:** Employment income; withholding applied by employer. Net monthly tax = ISK 109,573.67.

### Example 2 -- Self-employed calculated remuneration (annual)

**Input:** Sole proprietor, calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) ISK 9,000,000/yr = ISK 750,000/mo.

**Reasoning (monthly tax):**
- Bracket 1: 472,005 × 31.49% = 148,634.37
- Bracket 2: (750,000 − 472,005) = 277,995 × 37.99% = 105,610.30
- Gross monthly tax = 254,244.67; less credit 68,691 = **185,553.67/mo**.
- Annual income tax = 185,553.67 × 12 = **ISK 2,226,644.10**.

**Other levies on the same base:**
- Mandatory pension, employee 4%: 9,000,000 × 4% = ISK 360,000 (deductible from income tax base — see Section 5.5; example shown gross for illustration).
- Mandatory pension, employer 11.5% (self-employed pays both): 9,000,000 × 11.5% = ISK 1,035,000. Total pension 15.5% = ISK 1,395,000 (360,000 + 1,035,000 = 1,395,000 ✓).
- Tryggingagjald (general 6.35%): 9,000,000 × 6.35% = ISK 571,500.

**Classification:** Self-employed remuneration; income tax, pension, and tryggingagjald all due. Reviewer must confirm reiknað endurgjald meets the occupation minimum.

### Example 3 -- Capital income (interest above tax-free threshold)

**Input line:**
`31.12.2025 ; ARION BANKI ; VEXTIR — SPARNAÐUR ; +520,000.00 ; ISK`

**Reasoning:**
Interest income ISK 520,000. First ISK 300,000/yr per person is tax-free (Skatturinn). Taxable = 520,000 − 300,000 = 220,000 at 22% flat = **ISK 48,400**.

**Classification:** Capital income tax = ISK 48,400.

### Example 4 -- Employee net pay with pension deduction

**Input line:**
`25.03.2025 ; ÍSLANDSBANKI ; LAUN — STÚDÍÓ EHF ; +600,000.00 ; ISK`

**Reasoning:**
Gross wage ISK 600,000. Mandatory employee pension 4% = ISK 24,000 reduces the income tax base. Tax base = 600,000 − 24,000 = 576,000.
- Bracket 1: 472,005 × 31.49% = 148,634.37
- Bracket 2: (576,000 − 472,005) = 103,995 × 37.99% = 39,507.70
- Gross tax = 188,142.07; less credit 68,691 = net tax 119,451.07.
- Net pay = 600,000 − 24,000 (pension) − 119,451.07 (tax) = **ISK 456,548.93**.

**Classification:** Net pay ISK 456,548.93. Employer separately pays its 11.5% pension and 6.35% tryggingagjald on top of gross.

### Example 5 -- Top bracket (high earner)

**Input:** Monthly income ISK 1,500,000 (crosses into bracket 3).

**Reasoning:**
- Bracket 1: 472,005 × 31.49% = 148,634.37
- Bracket 2: (1,325,127 − 472,005) = 853,122 × 37.99% = 324,101.05
- Bracket 3: (1,500,000 − 1,325,127) = 174,873 × 46.29% = 80,948.71
- Gross tax = 553,684.13; less credit 68,691 = **net tax 484,993.13/mo**.

**Classification:** Monthly income tax = ISK 484,993.13. Capital and pension treated separately.

### Example 6 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15.05.2025 ; LANDSBANKINN ; MILLIFÆRSLA — EIGIN SPARNAÐARREIKNINGUR ; -2,000,000.00 ; ISK`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Combined Progressive Income Tax

**Legislation:** Act No. 90/2003 on Income Tax; Act No. 4/1995 (útsvar).

2025 individual income tax is a combined state income tax + municipal income tax (útsvar) on a progressive 3-bracket scale (withholding rates): 31.49% up to ISK 472,005/month; 37.99% from 472,006 to 1,325,127/month; 46.29% above 1,325,127/month (Skatturinn, Tax-brackets 2025). Annual thresholds are 12× the monthly figures (~ISK 5,664,060 and ~ISK 15,901,524).

### 5.2 Personal Tax Credit (persónuafsláttur)

The personal tax credit for 2025 is ISK 68,691/month = ISK 824,288/year, subtracted from **computed tax** (not from income). Unused credit is transferable between spouses (Skatturinn, Key rates 2025).

### 5.3 Municipal Tax (útsvar)

The municipal component is withheld at 14.94% but the final municipal rate ranges 12.44%–14.94% depending on the municipality of residence (PwC). Use 14.94% for conservative withholding.

### 5.4 Capital Income Tax

Capital income (capital gains, dividends, interest) is taxed at a flat 22%. The first ISK 300,000/year of interest and shareholding income per person is tax-free (Skatturinn, Key rates 2025).

### 5.5 Mandatory Occupational Pension (lífeyrissjóður)

**Legislation:** Act No. 129/1997.

- Minimum total 15.5% of remuneration: 4% employee + 11.5% employer. Mandatory for ages 16–70 (PwC).
- The 4% employee contribution is **deductible from the income tax base**.
- Self-employed pay both portions on their calculated remuneration.
- Employer contribution becomes taxable income to the employee only if it exceeds BOTH 12% of remuneration AND ISK 2,000,000/yr (PwC).
- Voluntary private pension (séreignarsparnaður): up to an additional 4% (employee), deductible within limits; employer match commonly up to 2% (PwC).

**Pension component check:** 4% + 11.5% = 15.5% total ✓.

### 5.6 Social Security Tax (tryggingagjald)

**Legislation:** Act No. 113/1990.

- General rate 6.35% on gross remuneration (Skatturinn 2025 "payroll tax 6.35%"; PwC corporate other-taxes).
- +0.65% surcharge for fishermen (so 7.00% combined for that category).
- Reduced to 0.425% for workers covered by an A1 form (EEA) (PwC).
- Employer pays it; self-employed pay it on calculated remuneration.

### 5.7 Calculated Remuneration (reiknað endurgjald)

**Legislation:** Act No. 90/2003.

Self-employed individuals must declare calculated remuneration at the market salary level for their occupation (Skatturinn's annual reiknað endurgjald table) and pay income tax, tryggingagjald, and pension on it. Withholding is generally remitted monthly (Skatturinn / island.is). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact 2025 occupation-category minimum amounts; not extracted in research. A secondary source (FreelancePay) indicates annual reiknað endurgjald under ISK 700,000 removes the employer-register obligation (tax still due) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm with Skatturinn]**.

### 5.8 VAT (VSK) Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT collected on sales (VSK-registered) | NOT income -- exclude from business income |
| Input VAT recovered (VSK-registered) | NOT an expense -- exclude |
| Non-recoverable / foreign VAT | IS an expense -- full gross is cost |
| Unregistered (below ISK 2,000,000 turnover) | All VAT paid on purchases is part of cost |

VAT registration is mandatory once 12-month turnover exceeds ISK 2,000,000; register via Form RSK 5.02 within 8 days. Standard VAT rate 24%, reduced rate 11% (Skatturinn, VAT page).

### 5.9 Other Individual Levies (2025)

For income above ISK 2,474,942/yr, ages 16–69 (Skatturinn, Key rates 2025):

| Levy | Amount (ISK) |
|---|---|
| National Broadcasting Service fee (útvarpsgjald) | 21,400 |
| Senior Citizens' Construction Fund fee (gjald í Framkvæmdasjóð aldraðra) | 14,093 |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

**Legislation:** Act No. 90/2003.

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room(s) as % of total floor area).
- Apply that percentage to: rent, electricity, heating (hitaveita), water, internet.
- A dual-use room does NOT qualify.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms a genuinely dedicated workspace and floor-area basis.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible.
- Client must maintain a mileage log. PwC indicates verifiable car operating costs of approx. ISK 83–142/km.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until mileage log provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business use portion only; client must provide a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Per Diem / Travel Subsistence

- Per diem for travel outside the contractual workplace may be deductible (PwC).
- **Flag for reviewer** to confirm the applicable per-diem rates and that travel is genuinely business.

### 6.5 Depreciation of Capital Assets (fyrningar)

- Business assets are depreciated under Act No. 90/2003 rather than fully expensed.
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the per-asset depreciation percentages (not extracted in research). Do not invent rates.

### 6.6 Voluntary Private Pension (séreignarsparnaður)

- Up to 4% additional employee contribution, deductible within limits; employer match commonly up to 2%.
- **Flag for reviewer** to confirm the deductible limit actually applied.

### 6.7 A1 / EEA Social-Security Coordination

- EEA workers can avoid Icelandic pension contributions with an A1 certificate if equivalent contributions are made in the home country (PwC); tryggingagjald reduced to 0.425%.
- **Flag for reviewer** to confirm the A1 certificate and home-country coverage.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee, single bracket-2 wage.**
Input: Monthly wage ISK 550,000, no pension adjustment shown.
Expected: Gross tax = 472,005 × 31.49% + 77,995 × 37.99% = 148,634.37 + 29,630.30 = 178,264.67; less credit 68,691 = **net tax ISK 109,573.67/mo**.

**Test 2 -- Self-employed, calculated remuneration 9,000,000/yr.**
Input: reiknað endurgjald ISK 750,000/mo.
Expected: Monthly tax = 148,634.37 + (277,995 × 37.99%) − 68,691 = 148,634.37 + 105,610.30 − 68,691 = 185,553.67; annual = **ISK 2,226,644.10**. Pension total 15.5% = ISK 1,395,000 (4% employee 360,000 + 11.5% employer 1,035,000). Tryggingagjald 6.35% = ISK 571,500.

**Test 3 -- Capital interest above threshold.**
Input: Interest ISK 520,000.
Expected: (520,000 − 300,000) × 22% = **ISK 48,400**.

**Test 4 -- Employee net pay with 4% pension.**
Input: Gross wage ISK 600,000.
Expected: base 576,000; gross tax 188,142.07; net tax 119,451.07; **net pay ISK 456,548.93** (600,000 − 24,000 pension − 119,451.07).

**Test 5 -- Top bracket.**
Input: Monthly income ISK 1,500,000.
Expected: 148,634.37 + (853,122 × 37.99%) + (174,873 × 46.29%) − 68,691 = 148,634.37 + 324,101.05 + 80,948.71 − 68,691 = **net tax ISK 484,993.13/mo**.

**Test 6 -- Child income.**
Input: Child born 2012, income ISK 400,000.
Expected: (400,000 − 180,000) × 6% = **ISK 13,200**.

**Test 7 -- Personal tax credit cancels small wage.**
Input: Monthly wage ISK 200,000 (bracket 1 only).
Expected: 200,000 × 31.49% = 62,980; less credit 68,691 → tax floored at 0 (unused credit 5,711 may carry/transfer). **Net tax ISK 0**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the brackets without confirming Icelandic tax residency.
- NEVER use a self-employed calculated remuneration (reiknað endurgjald) below the Skatturinn occupation minimum.
- NEVER hard-code a statutory minimum wage — Iceland has none; rates are set by collective agreements.
- NEVER subtract the personal tax credit from income — it is subtracted from computed tax.
- NEVER tax the first ISK 300,000/yr of interest + shareholding income per person.
- NEVER include VAT (VSK) collected on sales in business income for registered clients.
- NEVER treat income tax, fines, drawings, or loan principal as deductible expenses.
- NEVER invent depreciation (fyrning) rates — flag capital items for the reviewer.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and route through the deterministic engine.
- NEVER use a tryggingagjald rate other than 6.35% general (or 0.425% A1 / +0.65% fishermen) without reviewer confirmation.
