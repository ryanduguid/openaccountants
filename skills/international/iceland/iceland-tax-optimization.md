  Use this skill whenever asked about reducing tax in Iceland, tax planning, or legal strategies to minimise tax for a self-employed person or small company in Iceland. Trigger on phrases like "reduce tax Iceland", "ehf vs self-employed", "Iceland dividends 22%", "reiknað endurgjald", "reference salary", "Iceland company tax 20%", "save tax Iceland", "tax planning Iceland". This skill covers the ehf-company-plus-dividend structure vs self-employment, the mandatory owner reference-salary rule (reiknað endurgjald), capital-income vs labour-income treatment, pension and personal reliefs, and the anti-avoidance red lines. ALWAYS read this skill before advising on any Icelandic tax optimisation.

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Iceland |
| Currency | ISK |
| Headline lever | ehf company + dividends (20% CIT + 22% dividend) vs self-employment at high progressive labour rates — subject to the reference-salary rule |
| Corporate tax (ehf) | **20%** |
| Dividend / capital income | **22%** |
| Labour income | High progressive PIT + municipal tax (well above the capital rate) |
| Key rule | **reiknað endurgjald** — owner-managers must pay themselves a market reference salary before profit becomes low-taxed capital income |
| Anti-avoidance | Reference-salary rule; substance |

> **The Iceland lever is converting high-taxed labour income into lower-taxed capital income via an ehf** — but the **reiknað endurgjald** rule deliberately limits this: an active owner must first draw a reasonable salary (taxed as labour) before the remainder can be dividends at 22%.

---

## Section 2 -- ehf Company + Dividend vs Self-Employment

| Route | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Self-employed** | Business income taxed as **labour** on the high progressive scale + municipal tax + full social contributions |
| **ehf (private limited)** | 20% CIT on profit; profit extracted as **dividends at 22%** — but only **after** a market reference salary (labour-taxed) |

For higher earners the ehf can lower the overall rate by shifting the surplus (above a fair salary) into 22% capital income and deferring undistributed profit at the 20% corporate rate. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current labour-income brackets and whether retained ehf profit is genuinely deferred.]**

---

## Section 3 -- The Reference-Salary Rule (reiknað endurgjald) — the key constraint

Skatturinn publishes **minimum reference-salary tables** by occupation. An owner-manager who actively works in their ehf (or as self-employed) **must** declare at least that reference salary as labour income; you cannot take everything as 22% dividends to dodge labour tax.

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT.** Under-declaring the owner salary below the reference tables is a primary Skatturinn audit target. Set the salary at/above the published reference for the occupation and document it.

## Section 4 -- Deductions & Reliefs

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Personal tax credit (persónuafsláttur) | A fixed annual credit reduces tax for every resident — ensure fully used. |
| Pension contributions | Mandatory occupational pension + deductible additional (private) pension contributions up to a cap. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the deductible private-pension percentage.]** |
| Business expenses | Genuine costs deductible (self-employed / ehf). |
| Inter-company dividends | Dividends between resident limited companies are not subject to the 22% WHT — relevant for holding structures. |

---

## Section 5 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Reference salary (reiknað endurgjald):** never set an active owner's salary below the published occupational reference to convert labour into capital income.
- **Substance:** the ehf must carry on genuine business.
- Mislabelling private spending as company expense creates taxable benefits, not deductions.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER advise an active owner to take a salary below the Skatturinn reference tables to maximise 22% dividends.
- NEVER present the ehf route as avoiding labour tax entirely — the reference salary is labour-taxed.
- NEVER contradict the rates in `iceland-income-tax.md` / `iceland-social-contributions.md`.
- NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Icelandic tax adviser.
