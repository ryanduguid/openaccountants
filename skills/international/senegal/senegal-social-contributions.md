**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether employee is a "cadre" (executive) | Assume NON-cadre — apply IPRES General only; flag for reviewer |
| Unknown CSS work-injury risk category | Apply 5% (highest) as conservative; flag — actual rate is set by CSS on registration |
| Unknown gross above a scheme ceiling | Apply the ceiling base, not the full gross, for that scheme |
| Unknown IPM rate/fund | Apply 3% employer + 3% employee on base capped at 250,000; mark [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Unknown number of family-quotient parts | Compute on 1 part (single, no children) — most conservative IRPP; flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether DGID/Trésor debit is IRPP or social | Classify as statutory payroll obligation; flag for reviewer to split |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — monthly gross remuneration (XOF) and whether the employee is a **cadre** (executive/manager) or non-cadre. Without gross remuneration, STOP.

**Recommended** — CSS work-injury risk category (1%/3%/5%), number of family-quotient parts (marital status + dependent children), and which IPM fund the employer has joined.

**Ideal** — the employer's IPRES/CSS/IPM registration certificates (showing the exact assigned rates), prior payroll journals, and bank statements showing the monthly contribution debits.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-SN-SOC-1 -- Cadre vs non-cadre status unknown.** *Trigger:* not stated whether the employee is a cadre. *Message:* "The IPRES complementary cadre scheme (extra 6%, employer 3.6% / employee 2.4%) applies only to executives/managers. Cannot finalise IPRES without confirming cadre status. Defaulting to non-cadre (General only) and flagging for reviewer."

**R-SN-SOC-2 -- CSS work-injury rate.** *Trigger:* work-injury rate not provided. *Message:* "The CSS accidents-du-travail rate (1%, 3%, or 5%) is set by the Caisse de Sécurité Sociale per risk category on the employer's registration. Do not assume a rate; obtain the CSS registration certificate. Defaulting to 5% conservatively and flagging."

**R-SN-SOC-3 -- IPM rate/ceiling ambiguity.** *Trigger:* IPM computation requested. *Message:* "[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] PwC's individual and corporate pages describe IPM differently (2%–7.5% each vs 6% split 3%/3%) and the precise rate/ceiling depends on the specific IPM fund the employer joined. Do not present IPM as definitive — confirm against the actual IPM scheme."

**R-SN-SOC-4 -- Family quotient / parts.** *Trigger:* IRPP requested with dependants. *Message:* "[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] The exact family-quotient share schedule and the maximum-parts cap are not enumerated in PwC and must be confirmed against the CGI/DGID. Compute on 1 part and flag for reviewer."

**R-SN-SOC-5 -- Arrears / back-contributions.** *Trigger:* unpaid prior-period contributions. *Message:* "Late social-contribution and IRPP regularisation carries 5% interest plus 0.5% per month of delay (PwC). Do not quantify arrears without the institution's statement. Escalate to a Senegalese expert-comptable."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for Senegalese bank statement transactions related to payroll/social contributions. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the statement. These are statutory payroll obligations — **EXCLUDE** them from any VAT (TVA) return and never treat them as a business supply.

### 3.1 Pension contributions (IPRES)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IPRES, INST PREVOYANCE RETRAITE | EXCLUDE — pension contribution | General + cadre combined remittance |
| RETRAITE, COTISATION RETRAITE | EXCLUDE — pension contribution | French-language reference |
| REGIME GENERAL, REGIME CADRES | EXCLUDE — pension contribution | Explicit scheme reference |

### 3.2 Social security — family allowances & work injury (CSS)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CSS, CAISSE DE SECURITE SOCIALE | EXCLUDE — CSS contribution | Family allowances + work injury |
| PRESTATIONS FAMILIALES, ALLOC FAMILIALES | EXCLUDE — CSS family branch | Employer-only |
| ACCIDENT TRAVAIL, ACCIDENTS DU TRAVAIL | EXCLUDE — CSS work-injury branch | Employer-only |

### 3.3 Health insurance (IPM)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IPM, INST PREVOYANCE MALADIE | EXCLUDE — health contribution | Employer + employee share |
| MALADIE, COTISATION MALADIE | EXCLUDE — health contribution | French-language reference |

### 3.4 Employer payroll tax & income tax to DGID / Trésor

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CFCE, CONTRIBUTION FORFAITAIRE | EXCLUDE — employer payroll tax (3%) | Employer-only, no ceiling |
| IRPP, RETENUE A LA SOURCE, RAS | EXCLUDE — PAYE income tax withheld | Not a social contribution |
| DGID, IMPOTS, TRESOR PUBLIC | EXCLUDE — tax remittance | Could be IRPP and/or CFCE — flag to split |
| TVA, TAXE VALEUR AJOUTEE | EXCLUDE — VAT, not payroll | Separate obligation |

### 3.5 Salary & pension received (not contributions)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, NET A PAYER (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | Net wage to employee, not a contribution |
| SALAIRE, PAIE (incoming) | EXCLUDE — employment income received | Not a contribution |
| PENSION IPRES, PENSION RETRAITE (incoming) | EXCLUDE — pension income received | Benefit received, not a contribution paid |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Bank statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Dakar-based services company and its staff. All amounts XOF. PwC figures (reviewed 31 Mar 2026) underlie every rate.

### Example 1 -- Non-cadre at the IPRES general ceiling (CBAO)

**Input line:**
`30.06.2026 ; IPRES COTISATION RETRAITE ; DEBIT ; REGIME GENERAL JUIN ; -60,480 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
Employee monthly gross 500,000 but the IPRES General base is **capped at 432,000**. IPRES General total 14% × 432,000 = 60,480 (employer 8.4% × 432,000 = 36,288; employee 5.6% × 432,000 = 24,192; 36,288 + 24,192 = 60,480 ✓). Non-cadre, so no complementary scheme. Matches pattern 3.1.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — IPRES pension contribution. Statutory; not a VAT-bearing supply.

### Example 2 -- Cadre executive, both IPRES schemes (SGBS)

**Input line:**
`30.06.2026 ; IPRES REGIME CADRES ; DEBIT ; COMPLEMENTAIRE JUIN ; -77,760 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
Cadre with gross 1,296,000 (at the cadre ceiling). Complementary cadre scheme total 6% × 1,296,000 = 77,760 (employer 3.6% × 1,296,000 = 46,656; employee 2.4% × 1,296,000 = 31,104; 46,656 + 31,104 = 77,760 ✓). This is **in addition** to the General scheme (14% on base capped at 432,000 = 60,480, billed separately). Matches pattern 3.1.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — IPRES cadre complementary contribution.

### Example 3 -- CSS employer remittance (Ecobank)

**Input line:**
`15.07.2026 ; CSS CAISSE SECURITE SOCIALE ; DEBIT ; PRESTATIONS+AT JUIN ; -5,040 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
CSS base is capped at 63,000/month. Family allowances 7% × 63,000 = 4,410. Work injury (assume 1% risk category) 1% × 63,000 = 630. Total 4,410 + 630 = 5,040 ✓. 100% employer-borne. Matches pattern 3.2.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — CSS contribution (employer cost). Flag work-injury category for reviewer confirmation.

### Example 4 -- IPM health contribution (BICIS)

**Input line:**
`30.06.2026 ; IPM COTISATION MALADIE ; DEBIT ; JUIN ; -15,000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] Using PwC corporate-page figures: IPM 6% total split 3% employer / 3% employee on a base capped at 250,000. For an employee at/above the 250,000 ceiling: 6% × 250,000 = 15,000 (employer 3% × 250,000 = 7,500; employee 3% × 250,000 = 7,500; 7,500 + 7,500 = 15,000 ✓). Matches pattern 3.3. PwC's individual page describes IPM differently (2%–7.5% each) — do not finalise without confirming the fund's actual rate.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — IPM health contribution. Flag IPM rate/ceiling for reviewer.

### Example 5 -- CFCE employer payroll tax (CBAO)

**Input line:**
`30.06.2026 ; CFCE CONTRIBUTION FORFAITAIRE ; DEBIT ; PAIE JUIN ; -150,000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
CFCE is 3% of **total gross payroll with no ceiling** (PwC, employer-only). Monthly payroll 5,000,000 → 3% × 5,000,000 = 150,000 ✓. Matches pattern 3.4. Employer-only; never deducted from the employee.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — CFCE employer payroll tax. Deductible business cost; not VAT-bearing.

### Example 6 -- DGID PAYE / IRPP withholding remittance (SGBS)

**Input line:**
`15.07.2026 ; DGID TRESOR PUBLIC ; DEBIT ; RAS IRPP JUIN ; -52,000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:**
"DGID TRESOR PUBLIC" + "RAS IRPP" matches pattern 3.4. This is **monthly PAYE income tax withheld** from employees and remitted, NOT a social contribution. If the reference also bundled CFCE, request the payroll journal to split IRPP from CFCE. Do not classify as IPRES/CSS/IPM.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — IRPP (PAYE) remittance to DGID. NOT a social contribution. Flag to split if CFCE is bundled.

### Example 7 -- IRPP annual liability computation (1 part)

**Input:** Annual taxable income 3,000,000; single, no dependants → 1 part (most conservative default).

**Reasoning (progressive scale, PwC individual page):**
- 0–630,000 @ 0% = 0
- 630,001–1,500,000 @ 20% × 870,000 = 174,000
- 1,500,001–3,000,000 @ 30% × 1,500,000 = 450,000
- **Total IRPP = 0 + 174,000 + 450,000 = 624,000** ✓

MPIT floor for the 2,000,000–6,999,999 band is 12,000; computed tax 624,000 ≫ 12,000, so the scale tax stands. With dependants, parts > 1 would reduce this — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm parts schedule].

**Classification:** IRPP due (before quotient adjustment) = 624,000.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when inputs are clear.

### Rule 1 -- IPRES General applies to all employees

IPRES General = 14% total (employer 8.4% / employee 5.6%) on monthly base **capped at 432,000** (PwC, reviewed 31 Mar 2026). Per-employee contribution = 14% × min(gross, 432,000).

### Rule 2 -- IPRES Cadre is ADDITIONAL and only for executives

The complementary cadre scheme = 6% total (employer 3.6% / employee 2.4%) on base **capped at 1,296,000**, due **in addition** to the General scheme, only for cadres (managers/executives). Non-cadres: General only.

### Rule 3 -- CSS is 100% employer-borne, base capped at 63,000

Family allowances = 7%. Work injury = 1%, 3%, or 5% per CSS-assigned risk category. Both on base capped at 63,000/month (PwC). Never deduct CSS from the employee.

### Rule 4 -- IPM health insurance [RESEARCH GAP]

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] Per PwC corporate page: 6% total split 3% employer / 3% employee on base 60,000–250,000. PwC individual page gives 2%–7.5% each. Fund-specific. Do not present as definitive.

### Rule 5 -- CFCE has NO ceiling

CFCE = 3% of total gross payroll, employer-only, **no ceiling** — applies to full payroll (PwC). It is an employer payroll tax, not a withholding from the employee.

### Rule 6 -- IRPP is progressive, applied per share (family quotient)

Income is divided into shares (parts), tax computed per share on the scale below, then multiplied by the number of shares (PwC). Default to 1 part if parts unknown.

**IRPP annual scale (PwC individual page):**

| Annual taxable income (XOF) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 630,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 630,001 – 1,500,000 | 20% | 174,000 |
| 1,500,001 – 4,000,000 | 30% | 924,000 |
| 4,000,001 – 8,000,000 | 35% | 2,324,000 |
| 8,000,001 – 13,500,000 | 37% | 4,359,000 |
| 13,500,001 – 50,000,000 | 40% | 18,959,000 |
| Over 50,000,000 | 43% | — |

> **Cumulative check:** 174,000 + 30%×2,500,000 = 924,000 ✓; + 35%×4,000,000 = 2,324,000 ✓; + 37%×5,500,000 = 4,359,000 ✓; + 40%×36,500,000 = 18,959,000 ✓.

### Rule 7 -- Minimum Personal Income Tax (MPIT) floor

A minimum tax applies even where the scale yields less (PwC individual page):

| Annual income (XOF) | Minimum tax (XOF) |
|---|---|
| 0 – 599,999 | 900 |
| 600,000 – 999,999 | 3,600 |
| 1,000,000 – 1,999,999 | 4,800 |
| 2,000,000 – 6,999,999 | 12,000 |
| 7,000,000 – 11,999,999 | 18,000 |
| 12,000,000+ | 36,000 |

IRPP due = max(scale tax after quotient, MPIT band amount).

### Rule 8 -- PAYE is monthly

Employers withhold IRPP and the employee shares of social contributions **monthly** on gross remuneration (including fringe benefits and bonuses) and remit to DGID/Trésor and the institutions (PwC tax-administration page).

### Rule 9 -- Ceilings cap the BASE, not the contribution

Apply each scheme's monthly base ceiling before multiplying by the rate. A high salary does not raise IPRES/CSS/IPM contributions above the capped base; CFCE alone has no ceiling.

### Rule 10 -- Minimum wage (SMIG) for sanity-checks only

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] SMIG (general, non-agricultural) = 150,000/month (hourly 303.49) as of 1 Jan 2025, per **secondary HR sources** (Rivermate, Playroll) — PwC does not publish SMIG. Use only as a plausibility floor; confirm against the official décret SMIG.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

Flag these for reviewer confirmation when data is ambiguous.

### T2-1 -- Cadre classification borderline

**Trigger:** Employee's role could be cadre or non-cadre (e.g., senior technician, team lead).
**Issue:** Cadre status adds the 6% complementary scheme. Misclassification under- or over-states IPRES.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; confirm against the collective agreement (convention collective) and IPRES registration.

### T2-2 -- CSS work-injury risk category

**Trigger:** Work-injury rate not on the CSS certificate.
**Issue:** Rate is 1%, 3%, or 5% by activity risk; defaulting to 5% over-states cost.
**Action:** Obtain the CSS registration; flag for reviewer.

### T2-3 -- IPM fund and rate

**Trigger:** IPM computation needed but fund unknown. **[RESEARCH GAP]**
**Issue:** PwC individual vs corporate pages disagree (2–7.5% each vs 6% split 3/3); fund-specific.
**Action:** Confirm the employer's actual IPM scheme rate/ceiling before finalising. Flag.

### T2-4 -- Family quotient parts and cap

**Trigger:** Employee has a spouse and/or dependent children. **[RESEARCH GAP]**
**Issue:** PwC confirms the quotient mechanism but not the per-situation share schedule or maximum-parts cap. Secondary sources suggest single = 1; married = 1.5–2; +0.5/child, with a statutory cap.
**Action:** Confirm against the CGI/DGID before applying parts > 1.

### T2-5 -- Expatriate / seconded staff

**Trigger:** Foreign national or secondee.
**Issue:** Totalisation agreements, residence, and which schemes apply may differ; PwC general rates may not capture exemptions.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; confirm residence and any social-security agreement.

### T2-6 -- Arrears / late regularisation

**Trigger:** Unpaid prior-period IRPP or contributions.
**Issue:** 5% interest + 0.5%/month of delay (PwC). Penalties compound.
**Action:** Do not estimate; obtain institution statements; escalate to an expert-comptable.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How contribution debits appear on Senegalese bank statements

**CBAO / Attijariwafa, SGBS (Société Générale), Ecobank, BICIS, UBA, Bank of Africa:**
- References are usually in **French**: "IPRES", "COTISATION RETRAITE", "CSS", "CAISSE DE SECURITE SOCIALE", "IPM", "MALADIE", "CFCE", "DGID", "TRESOR PUBLIC", "RAS IRPP".
- Contribution debits are **outgoing (DEBIT)**, typically monthly, around mid-month for the prior month's payroll.
- IPRES, CSS, IPM are remitted to the **institutions**; IRPP (RAS) and CFCE go to **DGID / Trésor Public**.

**Key identification tips:**
1. Social contributions recur monthly with amounts tied to capped bases (IPRES base ≤ 432,000; cadre ≤ 1,296,000; CSS ≤ 63,000; IPM base ≤ 250,000) — CFCE alone scales with full payroll.
2. A debit to "DGID"/"TRESOR PUBLIC" may bundle IRPP and CFCE — request the payroll journal to split.
3. Do not confuse outbound IPRES contributions with inbound "PENSION IPRES" credits (benefits received).
4. TVA (VAT) debits are a separate obligation — never fold into payroll contributions.
5. Irregular lump sums referencing "REGULARISATION" or "ARRIERE" may include 0.5%/month + 5% interest — flag for reviewer.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If only a bank statement is provided and no payroll detail:

1. **Scan for contribution debits** — identify outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns (IPRES, CSS, IPM, CFCE, DGID/RAS).
2. **Group by institution** — IPRES (pension), CSS (family + injury), IPM (health), DGID (IRPP/CFCE).
3. **Reverse-check the bases:**
   - IPRES General debit ÷ 14% ⇒ implied base (capped at 432,000).
   - CSS debit ÷ (7% + injury%) ⇒ implied base (capped at 63,000).
   - CFCE debit ÷ 3% ⇒ implied total gross payroll (no cap).
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution classification derived from bank amounts only. Cadre status, CSS work-injury category, IPM fund/rate, and family-quotient parts are unverified. Reviewer must confirm before filing PAYE or the annual recapitulative returns."

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Non-cadre, gross 500,000 → IPRES General base capped 432,000. Total 14% × 432,000 = **60,480** (employer 36,288 / employee 24,192). ✓

**Test 2:** Cadre, gross 1,296,000 → cadre scheme 6% × 1,296,000 = **77,760** (employer 46,656 / employee 31,104), **plus** General 14% × 432,000 = 60,480 (billed separately). ✓

**Test 3:** CSS, gross 200,000, work-injury 1% → base capped 63,000. Family 7% × 63,000 = 4,410; injury 1% × 63,000 = 630; total **5,040** (employer-only). ✓

**Test 4:** CFCE, monthly payroll 5,000,000 → 3% × 5,000,000 = **150,000** (employer-only, no ceiling). ✓

**Test 5:** IPM [RESEARCH GAP], gross 300,000 → base capped 250,000. 6% × 250,000 = **15,000** (employer 7,500 / employee 7,500). Flag fund-specific rate. ✓

**Test 6:** IRPP, annual taxable 3,000,000, 1 part → 0 + 20%×870,000 + 30%×1,500,000 = 174,000 + 450,000 = **624,000**; MPIT floor (band 2,000,000–6,999,999) = 12,000 < 624,000, so scale tax stands. ✓

**Test 7:** IRPP, annual taxable 500,000, 1 part → scale tax 0 (in 0% band); MPIT floor (0–599,999) = **900** applies. IRPP due = 900. ✓

**Test 8:** IRPP, annual taxable 8,000,000, 1 part → cumulative at 8,000,000 = **2,324,000** (per Rule 6 table); MPIT floor 18,000 ≪, so 2,324,000 stands. ✓

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the IPRES cadre complementary scheme to a non-cadre, or omit it for a confirmed cadre.
- NEVER deduct CSS or CFCE from the employee — both are 100% employer-borne.
- NEVER apply a scheme's rate to gross above its capped base (IPRES 432,000 / cadre 1,296,000 / CSS 63,000 / IPM 250,000).
- NEVER apply a ceiling to CFCE — it has none; it is 3% of full payroll.
- NEVER present IPM rate/ceiling as definitive — it is a flagged [RESEARCH GAP]; confirm the fund.
- NEVER apply family-quotient parts > 1 without reviewer confirmation of the CGI parts schedule and cap.
- NEVER treat a DGID/Trésor "RAS IRPP" debit as a social contribution — it is PAYE income tax.
- NEVER quote SMIG as authoritative — it is from secondary sources only ([RESEARCH GAP]).
- NEVER estimate arrears/penalties without the institution's statement — escalate to an expert-comptable.
- NEVER present any figure as definitive — label as estimated, cite PwC, and direct to a Senegalese chartered accountant.
