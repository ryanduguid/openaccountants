# Senegal Personal Income Tax (IRPP) — Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — research-verified, pending accountant sign-off.** This skill was assembled from secondary sources (PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Senegal, the DGID, and Senegalese payroll references) and cross-checked against the Code Général des Impôts (CGI). Several figures could not be reconciled to a single authoritative text and are marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**. Do not file on the basis of this skill without a Senegalese chartered accountant (Expert-Comptable / member of ONECCA) confirming the flagged items.

### IRPP Progressive Scale — Barème (tax year 2025)

Applied to **annual net taxable income per family-quotient part** (see Section 4). Source: CGI Article 174 (post-2022 reform); cross-checked against AfricaPaieRH and AfroTools guides (https://africapaierh.com/juridique/cotisations-sociales-et-impots-au-senegal/ ; https://afrotools.com/fr/blog/guide-irpp-senegal-2026/).

| Annual taxable income per part (FCFA) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (FCFA) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 630,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 630,001 – 1,500,000 | 20% | 174,000 |
| 1,500,001 – 4,000,000 | 30% | 924,000 |
| 4,000,001 – 8,000,000 | 35% | 2,324,000 |
| 8,000,001 – 13,500,000 | 37% | 4,359,000 |
| Over 13,500,000 | 40% | — |

**Cumulative-tax arithmetic (verified):**
- Band 2: 870,000 × 20% = 174,000 → cumulative 174,000
- Band 3: 2,500,000 × 30% = 750,000 → cumulative 924,000
- Band 4: 4,000,000 × 35% = 1,400,000 → cumulative 2,324,000
- Band 5: 5,500,000 × 37% = 2,035,000 → cumulative 4,359,000

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — Top bracket conflict.** PwC's Senegal page (last reviewed 31 Mar 2026, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/taxes-on-personal-income) shows a **7-band** schedule topping out at **43%** (bands 13,500,001–50,000,000 @ 40% and 50,000,000+ @ 43%). This conflicts with the 6-band / 40% structure consistently reported by Senegalese payroll/tax sources and with CGI Article 174 as cited. The **6-band / 40%** structure above is used here; the PwC 43% top band must be reconciled against the current CGI text before any figure above 13,500,000 FCFA/part is published.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — First (0%) threshold.** Senegalese sources consistently give **630,000 FCFA** (post-reform); PwC and Rivermate give 600,000. The 630,000 figure is used here pending confirmation.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown family situation (parts) | STOP — do not apply the quotient without marital status + number of children |
| Unknown residency | Treat as **non-resident → out of scope** until residency confirmed (see R-SN-3) |
| Unknown whether cadre (executive) | Apply IPRES Régime Général only (no RC supplement) until confirmed |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown taxable benefit-in-kind value | Use the PwC notional scale (Section 11), flag for reviewer |
| Income above 13,500,000 FCFA/part | STOP — top-band rate unresolved (40% vs 43%); escalate |
| Self-employed turnover ≤ 50,000,000 FCFA | Consider CGU eligibility (Section 7); confirm activity type |

---

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement and/or payslips (bulletin de paie) for the full tax year, plus confirmation of (a) tax residency in Senegal, (b) family situation (marital status + number of dependent children → parts), and (c) employment vs self-employment status.

**Recommended** — full payroll summary (gross, IPRES/CSS withheld, IRPP withheld, TRIMF withheld), prior-year IRPP assessment, IPRES/CSS contribution statements, and confirmation of cadre (executive) status.

**Ideal** — complete income statement, all invoices/receipts, asset register, benefits-in-kind schedule, rental-income detail, and CGU declaration (if self-employed under CGU).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No income document at all = hard stop. Income document without supporting records = proceed with a reviewer warning: "This IRPP computation was produced from bank statement / payslips alone. The reviewer must verify the family-quotient parts, the cadre/non-cadre IPRES treatment, and that all deductions are supported."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-SN-1 — Family situation unknown.** "The family quotient (number of parts) is essential to compute IRPP. This skill cannot compute tax without marital status and number of dependent children. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-SN-2 — Income above the unresolved top band.** "Taxable income per part exceeds 13,500,000 FCFA. The top IRPP rate is unresolved in research (40% per CGI Art. 174 vs 43% per PwC). Escalate to a Senegalese Expert-Comptable to confirm the rate before computing."

**R-SN-3 — Non-resident / dual-resident.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation follow different rules (and withholding regimes). Out of scope. Escalate to a Senegalese Expert-Comptable."

**R-SN-4 — Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals (employees, sole traders, CGU). Companies pay corporate tax (Impôt sur les Sociétés) and file separate returns. Out of scope."

**R-SN-5 — Penalties / enforcement.** "Senegalese late-filing/late-payment penalty rates were not obtainable from an authoritative source in this research (see Section 9). Do not quote penalty figures. Escalate to a Senegalese Expert-Comptable who can read CGI Livre IV."

**R-SN-6 — Capital gains / property disposals.** "Capital gains and real-estate disposal taxation require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate."

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

Deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank-statement / payslip line matches a pattern, apply the treatment directly. Match by case-insensitive substring on the description as it appears (French / Wolof-influenced terms common). If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules (Section 5).

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, BULLETIN, VIREMENT SALAIRE, [employer] | Employment income (IRPP base) | Gross before withholding; goes through the barème |
| HONORAIRES, PRESTATION, FACTURE, CONSULTANCE | Self-employment / BNC income | Business income — confirm CGU vs réel regime |
| LOYER, LOYER PERÇU, RENT RECEIVED | Rental income | 30% standard deduction applies (Section 5.6) |
| DIVIDENDE, DIVIDENDS | Investment income | Proportional rate may apply (Section 5.7) — flag |
| INTÉRÊTS, INTERESTS | Investment income | Flag for reviewer |
| ORANGE MONEY, WAVE, FREE MONEY (business receipts) | Self-employment income | Mobile-money business receipts — match to invoices |
| STRIPE / PAYPAL / WISE PAYOUT | Self-employment income | Platform payout — match to underlying invoices |
| REMBOURSEMENT IMPÔT, TAX REFUND | EXCLUDE | Refund of prior-year tax, not income |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits) — Deductible (business, before abattement) [self-employed réel only]

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOYER BUREAU, OFFICE RENT | Office rent | Deductible | Dedicated business premises |
| HONORAIRES COMPTABLE, EXPERT-COMPTABLE, AUDIT | Accountancy fees | Deductible | |
| AVOCAT, NOTAIRE (business) | Legal fees | Deductible | Must be business-related |
| FOURNITURES, PAPETERIE | Office supplies | Deductible | |
| PUBLICITÉ, GOOGLE ADS, META ADS, MARKETING | Advertising | Deductible | |
| FRAIS BANCAIRES, COMMISSION BANCAIRE | Bank charges | Deductible | Business account only |
| INTERNET, ABONNEMENT (business) | Connectivity | Deductible | Business-use portion only |

### 3.3 Expense Patterns (Debits) — Not Deductible

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RESTAURANT, REPAS, DÉJEUNER, RÉCEPTION | Entertainment / meals | Not deductible | Private / blocked |
| COURSES, SUPERMARCHÉ, AUCHAN, EXCLUSIVE | Personal | Not deductible | Private living costs |
| AMENDE, PÉNALITÉ, CONTRAVENTION | Fines/penalties | Not deductible | Public policy |
| IMPÔT, IRPP, PAIEMENT DGID | Tax payments | Not deductible | Income tax cannot reduce income |
| RETRAIT, PRÉLÈVEMENT PERSO, GAB | Drawings / cash | Not deductible | Ask what cash was used for |

### 3.4 Statutory Withholdings & Exclusions

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IPRES, RETRAITE, PENSION (employee share) | Deductible from gross before abattement | See Section 5.2 |
| CSS, SÉCURITÉ SOCIALE | Employer-only (employee 0%) — EXCLUDE from employee deduction | Section 6 |
| TRIMF | Minimum personal tax withheld | Section 6 (TRIMF table) |
| CFCE | Employer-only payroll tax — EXCLUDE from employee | Section 6 |
| VIREMENT INTERNE, COMPTE PROPRE | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| REMBOURSEMENT PRÊT, PRÊT | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |

### 3.5 Senegalese Banks / Payment Rails — Statement Reference

| Institution | Common patterns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CBAO (Attijariwafa) | VIREMENT, PRÉLÈVEMENT, COMMISSION | PDF; description holds counterparty |
| SGBS (Société Générale Sénégal) | VIR, PRLV, FRAIS | PDF/CSV |
| Ecobank Sénégal | TRANSFER, DD, CHARGE | PDF |
| BICIS / UBA / Bank of Africa | VIREMENT, CHÈQUE, AGIOS | PDF |
| Orange Money / Wave / Free Money | PAIEMENT, TRANSFERT, RETRAIT | Mobile money — separate from bank; business vs personal must be confirmed |

## Section 4 — Family Quotient (Quotient Familial — Parts)

Taxable income is divided by the number of **parts**; the barème tax is computed on income **per part**, then multiplied by the number of parts. This delivers the family relief. Source: AfroTools IRPP guide (https://afrotools.com/fr/blog/guide-irpp-senegal-2026/); DGID parts simulator (https://www.dgid.sn/simulateur-part/).

| Family situation | Parts |
|---|---|
| Single, no children | 1 |
| Married, no children | 2 |
| Married + 1 child | 2.5 |
| Married + 2 children | 3 |
| Married + 3 children | 3.5 |
| Married + 4 children | 4 |
| Maximum | 5 |

Each dependent child = **+0.5 part**. Maximum total **5 parts**.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — Family-relief cap.** Secondary sources cite a maximum family-charge saving of approximately **300,000 FCFA/year** and a "~10% per additional part" framing (https://www.justanswer.com/social-security/...). This cap is secondary and unverified; confirm the plafonnement against the CGI before applying any ceiling to the quotient benefit. The reduction can never produce a refund.

---

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 IRPP computation order (employment income)

1. Start from **gross annual remuneration** (salary + taxable benefits-in-kind, Section 11).
2. Deduct mandatory **employee** social contributions (IPRES employee share — Section 6).
3. Apply the **30% lump-sum deduction (abattement)**, capped at **900,000 FCFA** (Section 5.2).
4. Result = **annual net taxable income**.
5. Divide by the **number of parts** (Section 4) → income per part.
6. Apply the **barème** (Section 1) to income per part → tax per part.
7. Multiply tax per part by number of parts → **IRPP before family-relief cap**.
8. Apply any family-relief cap **[RESEARCH GAP]** and confirm result is not negative.
9. Add **TRIMF** (Section 6) separately — it is a distinct minimum tax, not part of the barème.

### 5.2 The 30% lump-sum deduction (abattement)

**Legislation:** CGI; DGID flyer (via https://africapaierh.com/juridique/cotisations-sociales-et-impots-au-senegal/).

- 30% of employment income (representing professional expenses), **capped at 900,000 FCFA**.
- Applied **after** deducting employee IPRES/CSS contributions.
- A separate **30% standard deduction** applies to gross **rental income** (https://afrotools.com/fr/blog/guide-irpp-senegal-2026/).

### 5.3 Deductible social contributions

Only the **employee** share of IPRES is deductible from gross before the abattement. Employee CSS = 0% (CSS is employer-only). CFCE is employer-only. See Section 6.

### 5.4 Self-employment income

- Sole traders / professionals under the **réel** regime: net business profit (income less wholly-business expenses, Section 3.2) feeds the IRPP barème via the quotient.
- Small traders/service providers with turnover ≤ 50,000,000 FCFA may instead fall under the **CGU** synthetic tax (Section 7).
- **BNC** (non-commercial professional) income, rental income, or multiple employers → standard IRPP, must file an annual return (Section 8).

### 5.5 Non-deductible expenses

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Entertainment / personal meals | Private |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax (IRPP) itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |

### 5.6 Rental income

Gross rental income less a **30% standard deduction** (https://afrotools.com/fr/blog/guide-irpp-senegal-2026/). Net feeds the IRPP. Income from land may attract a proportional rate — see 5.7 and flag for reviewer.

### 5.7 Proportional rates by income type

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].** PwC reports proportional rates layered alongside the progressive IRPP by income nature: **wages/salaries 11%**, **dividends 10%**, **income from land 20%**, **other income 25%** (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/taxes-on-personal-income). In practice the salary computation now runs through the single progressive barème above. Whether all proportional rates still apply post-reform must be confirmed before relying on them.

---

## Section 6 — Social Security & Payroll Levies

All figures below confirmed by **PwC** (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/other-taxes) **and** the official **DGID flyer** (parsed via https://africapaierh.com/juridique/cotisations-sociales-et-impots-au-senegal/); the two sources agree.

### 6.1 IPRES — Retirement (pension)

| Regime | Employer | Employee | Total | Monthly ceiling (base) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Régime Général (RG) | 8.4% | 5.6% | **14.0%** | 432,000 FCFA/month (5,184,000/yr) |
| Régime Complémentaire / Cadre (RC) | 3.6% | 2.4% | **6.0%** | 1,296,000 FCFA/month (15,552,000/yr) — executives/cadres only |

**Total-column arithmetic (verified):** RG 8.4% + 5.6% = 14.0%. RC 3.6% + 2.4% = 6.0%. RC applies **in addition** to RG for cadres only.

### 6.2 CSS — Caisse de Sécurité Sociale (employer-only)

| Branch | Rate | Payer | Monthly ceiling (base) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Prestations familiales (family benefits) | 7.0% | Employer only | 63,000 FCFA |
| Accident du travail / maladie professionnelle | 1%, 3% or 5% (by industry risk) | Employer only | 63,000 FCFA |

Employee CSS contribution = **0%**.

### 6.3 Health insurance (IPM / employment medical coverage)

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — exact split and caps.** PwC: ~6% on a base of 60,000–250,000 FCFA/month, **split between employer and employee**; secondary sources cite employer cap ~30,000 FCFA/month and employee portion ~10,000 FCFA/month. "Non-work-related illness" coverage: 2%–7.5% shared employer/employee, base up to 250,000 FCFA/month (PwC, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/other-taxes). Confirm the exact split before computing.

### 6.4 CFCE — Contribution Forfaitaire à la Charge de l'Employeur

- **3.0%** of gross taxable salary, **employer only** (payroll tax). Source: DGID flyer (https://africapaierh.com/juridique/cotisations-sociales-et-impots-au-senegal/).

### 6.5 TRIMF — Taxe Représentative de l'Impôt du Minimum Fiscal

A flat minimum personal tax due by every resident receiving salary/pension (unless exempt), withheld monthly. Scale depends only on salary level. **Monthly** amounts (Horus payroll knowledge base, https://helpdesk.horus-solutions.org/kb/faq.php?id=14):

| Monthly salary base (FCFA) | TRIMF (monthly, FCFA) |
|---|---|
| < 50,000 | 0 |
| 50,000 – 83,332 | 300 |
| 83,333 – 166,665 | 400 |
| 166,666 – 583,332 | 500 |
| 583,333 – 999,999 | 1,500 |
| 1,000,000 + | 3,000 |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — TRIMF annual scale.** These appear to be **monthly** figures (annualised they correspond to the commonly cited annual TRIMF scale topping out around 18,000–36,000 FCFA/year). The exact **annual** scale and top amount could not be pinned to a single authoritative DGID table. Multiply by TRIMF shares (1 for employee + 1 for a non-working spouse). Confirm against the CGI/DGID barème before publishing annual figures.

---

## Section 7 — Self-Employed / Small Business: Contribution Globale Unique (CGU)

Synthetic single tax for small individual entrepreneurs. Legislation: CGI Article 141+. Sources: https://kof-experts.sn/2024/04/26/the-unified-global-contribution-ugc-in-senegal/?lang=en ; DGID (http://www.impotsetdomaines.gouv.sn/fr/faire-une-declaration-pour-la-contribution-globale-unique).

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Eligibility threshold | Annual turnover (all taxes included) ≤ **50,000,000 FCFA** — same for goods delivery and for services |
| Excludes | BNC (non-commercial-profit) activities; real-estate sale/rental/management |
| Replaces 6 levies | IR on industrial/commercial profits (BIC), minimum fiscal tax (IMF), local economic contribution (CEL)/patente, beverage-licence duty, VAT, and the employer payroll contribution (CFCE) |
| Minimum payable — traders/goods | **25,000 FCFA** |
| Minimum payable — service providers | **30,000 FCFA** |
| Rate | Progressive by bracket (CGI Art. 141) — **[RESEARCH GAP — bracket schedule not captured]**; obtain from the DGID CGU simulator (http://www.impotsetdomaines.gouv.sn/fr/simulateur/cgu) |
| Annual declaration | To the managing tax centre by **end of February** |
| Opt-out to réel / réel simplifié | Notify by **31 January** |
| Payment (≤ 100,000 FCFA total) | One instalment before **1 March** |
| Payment (> 100,000 FCFA) | Two instalments on **15 March** and **15 May**, each = one-third of tax due |

---

## Section 8 — Filing & Payment Deadlines

- **Tax year:** calendar year.
- **Annual IRPP return:** all individuals subject to PIT must file **before 1 May** of each year (some local sources say "before 30 April" — effectively the same). Salary-only earners whose tax is fully withheld at source by the employer are generally exempt from filing. Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/tax-administration.
- **PAYE / withholding:** employers withhold IRPP + TRIMF + employee IPRES **monthly** on gross remuneration (incl. benefits-in-kind and bonuses); remitted to DGID/CSS/IPRES typically by **~the 15th of the following month**. Source: Rivermate (https://rivermate.com/guides/senegal/taxes) — **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm exact remittance date against the DGID calendar]**.
- **CGU:** see Section 7.

---

## Section 9 — Penalties

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — penalties not sourced.** Specific Senegalese late-filing / late-payment penalty rates and interest (majorations / intérêts de retard) were **not obtainable from an authoritative source** in this research (PwC's tax-administration page omits them). **Do not invent or quote penalty figures.** They must be extracted directly from the Senegalese **Code Général des Impôts, Livre IV (procédures fiscales)**. Reference copy: https://senegal.eregulations.org/media/t-code-general-impots[1].pdf. Escalate any penalty question to a Senegalese Expert-Comptable (see R-SN-5).

---

## Section 10 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 10.1 Cadre (executive) status — IPRES RC

- The IPRES Régime Complémentaire (RC) 2.4% employee / 3.6% employer supplement applies **only to cadres (executives)**.
- **Conservative default:** apply RG only (no RC) until cadre status is confirmed.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm cadre classification and the correct ceiling base.

### 10.2 Family quotient parts

- Number of parts depends on marital status and dependent children (Section 4).
- **Conservative default:** STOP — do not compute without confirmed parts.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm number of dependent children and the (unverified) family-relief cap.

### 10.3 Benefits-in-kind valuation

- Taxable benefits use the PwC notional scale (Section 11).
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm each benefit and whether the statutory travel allowance exemption applies.

### 10.4 Proportional vs progressive rates

- Whether the proportional rates (Section 5.7) still apply post-reform is unresolved.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm treatment for dividends, land income, and "other" income.

### 10.5 Home office / mixed-use expenses (self-employed réel)

- Only the business-use portion of phone, internet, and premises is deductible.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until a documented business percentage is provided.

### 10.6 CGU vs réel regime

- Turnover near the 50,000,000 FCFA threshold, or activities that exclude CGU (BNC, real estate), require a regime determination.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm eligibility and whether opting into réel is beneficial.

---

## Section 11 — Benefits-in-Kind Notional Values

Taxable notional values (FCFA/month), per PwC (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/senegal/individual/income-determination):

| Benefit | Notional value (FCFA/month) |
|---|---|
| Accommodation | 13,500 – 33,500 |
| Domestic staff | 35,600 – 92,500 |
| Utilities | 10,500 – 30,200 |
| Company car | 26,000 – 77,500 |
| Telephone | 67,000 |
| Statutory travel allowance | **Exempt up to 26,000 FCFA/month** |

---

## Section 12 — Worked Examples

All examples use the 6-band barème (Section 1), the 30% abattement capped at 900,000, and IPRES employee shares (Section 6). Arithmetic recomputed end-to-end. TRIMF added separately. **Family-relief cap not applied (unverified — flagged).**

### Example 1 — Single, no children (1 part), cadre, gross 6,000,000 FCFA/yr

**Payslip line:**
`31/03/2025 ; CBAO ; VIREMENT SALAIRE ; SOCIÉTÉ ABC SARL ; +500,000.00 ; FCFA` (×12 = 6,000,000/yr)

**Reasoning:**
- IPRES RG employee: 5.6% × min(6,000,000, 5,184,000) = 5.6% × 5,184,000 = **290,304**
- IPRES RC employee (cadre): 2.4% × min(6,000,000, 15,552,000) = 2.4% × 6,000,000 = **144,000**
- Total IPRES employee = 290,304 + 144,000 = **434,304**
- Gross less social = 6,000,000 − 434,304 = **5,565,696**
- Abattement = min(30% × 5,565,696, 900,000) = min(1,669,708.8, 900,000) = **900,000** (capped)
- Net taxable = 5,565,696 − 900,000 = **4,665,696**
- Parts = 1 → income per part = 4,665,696
- Barème: cumulative at 4,000,000 = 924,000; excess 665,696 × 35% = 232,993.6 → tax per part = **1,156,993.6**
- × 1 part = **IRPP ≈ 1,156,994 FCFA**
- TRIMF: monthly base 500,000 FCFA → 500 FCFA/month × 12 = **6,000 FCFA/yr** (annual scale unverified — flagged)

**Result:** IRPP ≈ 1,156,994 FCFA + TRIMF 6,000 FCFA.

### Example 2 — Married + 2 children (3 parts), cadre, gross 9,000,000 FCFA/yr

**Reasoning:**
- IPRES RG employee: 5.6% × 5,184,000 = **290,304**
- IPRES RC employee: 2.4% × 9,000,000 = **216,000**
- Total IPRES employee = **506,304**
- Gross less social = 9,000,000 − 506,304 = **8,493,696**
- Abattement = min(30% × 8,493,696, 900,000) = min(2,548,108.8, 900,000) = **900,000** (capped)
- Net taxable = 8,493,696 − 900,000 = **7,593,696**
- Parts = 3 → income per part = 7,593,696 / 3 = **2,531,232**
- Barème: cumulative at 1,500,000 = 174,000; excess 1,031,232 × 30% = 309,369.6 → tax per part = **483,369.6**
- × 3 parts = **IRPP ≈ 1,450,109 FCFA** (before any family-relief cap — flagged)
- TRIMF: monthly base 750,000 FCFA → 1,500 FCFA/month × 12 = **18,000 FCFA/yr** (annual scale unverified — flagged)

**Result:** IRPP ≈ 1,450,109 FCFA + TRIMF 18,000 FCFA.

### Example 3 — Single, low earner (1 part), non-cadre, gross 1,800,000 FCFA/yr

**Reasoning:**
- IPRES RG employee: 5.6% × min(1,800,000, 5,184,000) = 5.6% × 1,800,000 = **100,800**
- No RC (non-cadre).
- Gross less social = 1,800,000 − 100,800 = **1,699,200**
- Abattement = min(30% × 1,699,200, 900,000) = min(509,760, 900,000) = **509,760**
- Net taxable = 1,699,200 − 509,760 = **1,189,440**
- Parts = 1 → income per part = 1,189,440
- Barème: cumulative at 630,000 = 0; excess (1,189,440 − 630,000) = 559,440 × 20% = **111,888**
- × 1 part = **IRPP ≈ 111,888 FCFA**
- TRIMF: monthly base 150,000 FCFA → 400 FCFA/month × 12 = **4,800 FCFA/yr** (annual scale unverified — flagged)

**Result:** IRPP ≈ 111,888 FCFA + TRIMF 4,800 FCFA.

### Example 4 — Self-employed trader, CGU regime

**Input:** Sole trader, annual turnover 18,000,000 FCFA (all taxes included), goods retail.

**Reasoning:**
- Turnover 18,000,000 ≤ 50,000,000 → CGU-eligible (goods). Not BNC, not real estate.
- CGU replaces BIC/IMF/CEL/patente/beverage-licence/VAT/CFCE.
- Tax = progressive CGU bracket on turnover — **[RESEARCH GAP — bracket schedule not captured]**; compute via DGID CGU simulator.
- **Minimum payable = 25,000 FCFA** (goods trader).
- Declaration by end of February; if total > 100,000 FCFA → two instalments (15 March, 15 May).

**Result:** CGU due = simulator output, but **not less than 25,000 FCFA**. Do NOT run this trader through the IRPP barème.

### Example 5 — Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; SGBS ; VIREMENT INTERNE — COMPTE ÉPARGNE ; ; -2,000,000.00 ; FCFA`

**Reasoning:** Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Result:** EXCLUDE.

### Example 6 — Rental income (30% deduction)

**Input line:**
`05/02/2025 ; ECOBANK ; LOYER PERÇU — APPT DAKAR ; LOCATAIRE D. NDIAYE ; +400,000.00 ; FCFA` (×12 = 4,800,000/yr)

**Reasoning:**
- Gross rent = 4,800,000 FCFA/yr.
- 30% standard deduction = 1,440,000 → net rental = **3,360,000 FCFA**.
- Net feeds IRPP (combined with other income, divided by parts). Income from land may attract a proportional rate (Section 5.7) — **flag for reviewer**.

**Result:** Net rental 3,360,000 FCFA into the IRPP base; proportional-rate treatment flagged.

## Section 16 — Reference Material & Test Suite

### Key references

| Topic | Reference |
|---|---|
| IRPP progressive scale | CGI Articles 173–174 (post-2022 reform) — cross-checked AfricaPaieRH / AfroTools |
| 30% abattement (cap 900,000) | DGID flyer (via AfricaPaieRH); PwC deductions page |
| Family quotient (parts) | AfroTools IRPP guide; DGID parts simulator (https://www.dgid.sn/simulateur-part/) |
| TRIMF | Horus payroll KB (https://helpdesk.horus-solutions.org/kb/faq.php?id=14) — annual scale flagged |
| IPRES / CSS / CFCE rates | PwC "other taxes"; DGID flyer (both agree) |
| Benefits-in-kind | PwC income-determination page |
| CGU (synthetic tax) | CGI Art. 141+; DGID CGU pages; KOF Experts guide |
| Filing deadline | PwC tax-administration page |
| Penalties | **[RESEARCH GAP]** — CGI Livre IV (eregulations PDF) |
| Minimum wage (SMIG) | **[RESEARCH GAP]** — see below |

### Minimum wage (SMIG) — informational only

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].** Conflicting secondary figures: ~**64,223 FCFA/month** (hourly ~370.526 FCFA) after a 5–10% private-sector increase decree (https://www.sikafinance.com/...); other sources cite ~58,900 FCFA/month or ~52,500 FCFA. Base instrument historically Decree No. 2018-1048 (11 June 2018) for SMIG (non-agricultural) and SMAG (agricultural). Most plausibly ~64,000 FCFA/month for 2025 after revaluation, but confirm against the official Ministère du Travail decree. SMAG (agricultural) is lower. Not used in any IRPP computation here.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the barème without a confirmed family-quotient parts figure.
- NEVER compute tax for income per part above 13,500,000 FCFA — the top rate (40% vs 43%) is unresolved.
- NEVER quote a Senegalese late-filing / late-payment penalty figure — they are unsourced (research gap).
- NEVER apply the IPRES RC supplement to a non-cadre.
- NEVER treat the 30% abattement as uncapped — it is capped at 900,000 FCFA.
- NEVER deduct employee CSS — the employee CSS rate is 0%.
- NEVER deduct CFCE from the employee — it is employer-only.
- NEVER run a CGU-eligible small trader through the IRPP barème.
- NEVER allow entertainment, fines, drawings, or income tax itself as a deduction.
- NEVER present any flagged [RESEARCH GAP] figure as definitive — escalate to a Senegalese Expert-Comptable.
