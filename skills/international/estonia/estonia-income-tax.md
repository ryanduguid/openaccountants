### Personal Income Tax Rate (2025 and 2026)

Estonia has a **proportional (flat) personal income tax**. There are **no brackets** and **no local income taxes**. The only relief is the basic exemption (see below).

| Tax Year | Rate | Applies To | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | **22%** | All resident individual income (employment, business/FIE income, capital, rental) | [EMTA, Tax rates] -- raised from 20% to 22% effective 1 Jan 2025 |
| 2026 | **22%** | Same -- all resident individual income | [Estonian Chamber of Commerce; EMTA, Tax rates] |

**STALE-FIGURE WARNING.** Some 2024-2025 secondary sources (EY, Estonian Chamber of Commerce headlines) state that income tax would rise to **24% from 2026** and that a temporary 2% defence/security tax would apply. **Both were cancelled** -- the defence/security tax was abolished (19 June 2025) and the Riigikogu cancelled the 24% income-tax rise in December 2025. The personal income tax rate **stays 22%** for 2026. (VAT did rise to 24% from 1 July 2025 -- that is a separate tax; see Section 5.7.)

### Basic Exemption (maksuvaba tulu)

**The basic exemption is Estonia's equivalent of a personal allowance. Treatment differs sharply between 2025 and 2026.**

| Category | Tax Year | Annual (EUR) | Monthly (EUR) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| General | 2025 | up to 7,848 | up to 654 | **Income-dependent ("tax hump")** -- full amount only if annual income <= 14,400 | [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption] |
| General -- taper | 2025 | see formula | -- | Income 14,400-25,200: BE = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x (annual income - 14,400). **Zero above 25,200** | [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption] |
| Pensionable age | 2025 | 9,312 | 776 | Fixed, **not** income-dependent (persons born 1961 or earlier); applied automatically by the Social Insurance Board | [EMTA, Tax rates] |
| General | 2026 | 8,400 | 700 | **The income taper is abolished** -- flat 8,400 EUR/yr for everyone regardless of income | [EMTA, Tax rates] |
| Pensionable age | 2026 | 9,312 | 776 | Fixed, not income-dependent | [EMTA, Tax rates] |

**2025 taper worked check:** at income 14,400 EUR, BE = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x 0 = **7,848**. At income 25,200 EUR, BE = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x 10,800 = 7,848 - 7,848 = **0**. The taper is linear over the 10,800 EUR band. [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption]

### Contributions Snapshot (2025)

| Contribution | Rate | Paid by | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social tax (sotsiaalmaks) | 33% (20% pension + 13% health) | Employer (on top of gross); FIE on own profit | Min monthly base 820 EUR -> min obligation 270.60 EUR/mo (2025). No ceiling for employees | [EMTA, Social tax] |
| Unemployment insurance -- employee | 1.6% | Employee (withheld) | Rate fixed 2025-2028. Pensionable-age persons exempt. FIE not subject | [EMTA, Unemployment insurance premiums] |
| Unemployment insurance -- employer | 0.8% | Employer | Still payable for pensionable-age workers. FIE not subject | [EMTA, Unemployment insurance premiums] |
| Funded (II) pension -- employee | 2% default (or 4% / 6% by election) | Employee (withheld); state adds 4% from the 33% social tax | Mandatory for residents born after 31 Dec 1982; voluntary otherwise. 4%/6% election possible since 1 Jan 2024 | [PwC Estonia, Other taxes] |

**Total employer on-cost** = 33% social tax + 0.8% unemployment insurance = ~33.8% on top of gross [EMTA, Social tax].
**2026 social-tax floor:** minimum monthly base 886 EUR -> minimum obligation 292.38 EUR/mo (886 x 33%) [EMTA, Social tax].

### FIE (Self-Employed) Key Figures

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Income tax on business profit | 22% on profit (income minus allowable deductions) | [EMTA, Self-employed -- income tax] |
| Social tax on business profit | 33% on the same profit; social tax itself is **not** deductible from the income-tax base | [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax] |
| FIE social-tax annual ceiling (2025) | **35,085.60 EUR** = 886 x 10 x 12 x 33% | [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax] |
| FIE quarterly social-tax advance (2025) | **811.80 EUR** each = 820 x 3 x 33% | [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax] |
| Advance due dates | 15th of the last month of each quarter (15 Mar, 15 Jun, 15 Sep, 15 Dec) | [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax] |
| Advance exemptions | Students, pensioners, and those simultaneously employed (Class 1 social tax already paid) | [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax] |

**FIE ceiling worked check (2025):** 886 x 10 = 8,860; x 12 = 106,320; x 33% = **35,085.60**.
**FIE quarterly advance worked check (2025):** 820 x 3 = 2,460; x 33% = **811.80**.

### Key Thresholds

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| VAT registration (resident) | Mandatory once taxable turnover exceeds **40,000 EUR** in a calendar year; EU-wide SME cross-border threshold 100,000 EUR | [EMTA, Obligation to register] |
| Entrepreneur account (ettevõtluskonto) max annual receipts | **40,000 EUR/yr**; above this, register as FIE or company and become VAT-liable | [EMTA, Entrepreneur account] |
| Minimum wage 2025 | 886 EUR/month; 5.31 EUR/hour | [ERR News; EMTA] |
| Minimum wage 2026 | 946 EUR/month; 5.67 EUR/hour | [ERR News] |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** The 2026 minimum wage of 946 EUR is reported to take effect **1 April 2026** (not 1 January) per the tripartite agreement -- verify the exact effective date in the final government regulation. The 5.31 EUR/hour 2025 hourly figure is derived/secondary -- confirm against the official regulation. The 2025 minimum wage (886 EUR) coincides numerically with the 2026 social-tax minimum base (886 EUR) but they are distinct concepts (see Section 10).
>
> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** One EMTA-derived figure cited a **2026** FIE social-tax ceiling of 36,867.60 EUR -- recompute from the confirmed 2026 minimum wage before relying on it. Note the 2025 ceiling formula above uses the 886 EUR base while the 2025 quarterly advance uses the 820 EUR floor; confirm the exact statutory base used for each before wiring formulas.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown tax year | Use 2025 (the operative year, filed by 30 April 2026); confirm if near a 2025/2026 boundary, since basic-exemption rules differ materially |
| Unknown residency | STOP -- do not apply resident rates without confirming Estonian tax residency |
| Basic-exemption application unknown | If the employee has NOT filed an application with the employer, withhold 22% on full gross (no monthly BE) |
| 2025 basic exemption, income above 25,200 | EUR 0 exemption |
| 2026 basic exemption (under pension age) | Flat 8,400 EUR/yr |
| Funded-pension rate unknown | Assume 2% (statutory default) for residents born after 1982; 0% for non-members. Verify in Pensionikeskus before assuming 4%/6% |
| FIE social tax base | 33% on profit after deductions, subject to the 2025 annual cap of 35,085.60 EUR; quarterly advances 811.80 EUR unless exempt |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Pensionable-age status unknown | Do NOT apply the 9,312 EUR fixed exemption or the UI exemption without confirming date of birth |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (1) tax year, (2) Estonian tax residency, (3) status (employed individual / FIE self-employed / entrepreneur-account holder), and (4) date of birth (drives pensionable-age exemption, funded-pension mandatory status, and UI exemption).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, social-tax advance payment records, prior-year Form A / Form E, funded-pension (II pillar) membership and elected rate from Pensionikeskus, VAT registration status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, FIE asset/expense register, advance-payment confirmations, TSD monthly declarations for the year (if an employer), employment income details (if mixed), entrepreneur-account statement.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This Form E / Form A was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and incurred in the production of business income."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-EE-1 -- Tax year not confirmed.** "The 2025 and 2026 rules differ materially (basic-exemption taper vs fixed, social-tax floor). This skill cannot reliably compute tax without knowing the tax year. Confirm before proceeding."

**R-EE-2 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether resident rules (flat 22% with basic exemption) or non-resident rules apply. This skill covers resident natural persons. Confirm Estonian tax residency before proceeding."

**R-EE-3 -- Companies (OÜ/AS) and distributed-profit tax.** "This skill covers resident individuals and sole proprietors (FIE) only. Estonian companies (OÜ, AS) are taxed on distributed profits under a separate corporate regime. Escalate to an Estonian-qualified tax adviser."

**R-EE-4 -- Capital gains / securities / property disposals.** "Capital-gains specifics, the investment-account regime, and property disposals were not researched in this skill. Out of scope. Escalate to an Estonian-qualified tax adviser."

**R-EE-5 -- Non-resident income / treaty relief.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation, and double-tax-treaty relief, were not researched in this skill and have different rules. Escalate to an Estonian-qualified tax adviser."

**R-EE-6 -- Fringe-benefit tax.** "Employer fringe-benefit (erisoodustus) taxation was not researched in this skill. Escalate to an Estonian-qualified tax adviser."

**R-EE-7 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears. Late-payment interest runs at 0.06%/day (~21.9%/year) and is uncapped until paid. Do not advise on settlement strategy. Escalate to an Estonian-qualified tax adviser immediately."

**R-EE-8 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax (Form A / Form E) and payroll (TSD) only. For Estonian VAT (KMD), use the dedicated Estonia VAT skill. Note: standard VAT rose to 24% on 1 July 2025."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Estonian statements frequently mix Estonian and English terms. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules. "Form E" refers to the FIE business-income declaration filed with Form A.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (VAT-registered FIE)

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; LHV ÜLEKANNE ; STUUDIO KASK OÜ ; ARVE 2025-003 ; +1,240.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Client payment for services. The FIE is VAT-registered. Standard VAT is 24% from 1 July 2025 (was 22% before). For a 24% invoice, EUR 1,240 includes VAT, so net business income = 1,240 / 1.24 = EUR 1,000.00 (Form E). The EUR 240.00 is VAT collected -- excluded from income (a liability to EMTA).

**Classification:** Form E business income = EUR 1,000.00. VAT EUR 240.00 excluded. If the supply dated before 1 July 2025, VAT is 22%, so net = 1,240 / 1.22 = EUR 1,016.39 -- confirm the supply date. If not VAT-registered, the full EUR 1,240 is business income. [EMTA VAT pages]

### Example 2 -- SaaS Subscription (Fully Deductible)

**Input line:**
`01.04.2025 ; SEB KAARDIMAKSE ; ADOBE SYSTEMS IRELAND ; CREATIVE CLOUD ; -29.99 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, used in the business. Fully deductible as a Form E operating expense. For a VAT-registered FIE, the net amount (excl. recoverable input VAT) is the expense; otherwise the gross amount.

**Classification:** Form E deduction = EUR 29.99 (or net if VAT-registered with recoverable input VAT).

### Example 3 -- Personal Groceries (Not Deductible)

**Input line:**
`22.04.2025 ; SWEDBANK KAARDIMAKSE ; RIMI EESTI ; OST ; -64.20 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Supermarket purchase. Private living cost. Not incurred for the production of business income. No deduction, no apportionment.

**Classification:** NOT deductible. Exclude from Form E.

### Example 4 -- FIE Social-Tax Quarterly Advance

**Input line:**
`14.03.2025 ; SWEDBANK ÜLEKANNE ; EMTA SOTSIAALMAKSU AVANSS ; Q1 2025 ; -811.80 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
FIE quarterly social-tax advance (820 x 3 x 33% = 811.80 for 2025), due 15 March. This is **not** a deduction against business profit -- it is a payment toward the FIE's own social-tax liability and is reconciled on assessment. Track it separately as a payment on account.

**Classification:** Social-tax advance payment (credit against liability) = EUR 811.80. NOT a Form E expense. [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax]

### Example 5 -- Employee Net Pay (Monthly Payroll, 2025)

**Input:** Resident employee, gross monthly wage EUR 2,000, born after 1982 (funded pension 2% default), basic-exemption application filed with this employer (monthly BE 654 EUR), single employer.

**Reasoning (employee deductions, in order):**
1. Unemployment insurance (employee) = 2,000 x 1.6% = **32.00**
2. Funded pension (II pillar) = 2,000 x 2% = **40.00**
3. Income-tax base = gross - UI - pension - basic exemption = 2,000 - 32.00 - 40.00 - 654.00 = **1,274.00**
4. Income tax = 1,274.00 x 22% = **280.28**
5. **Net pay** = 2,000 - 32.00 - 40.00 - 280.28 = **1,647.72**

**Employer on-cost (on top of gross):**
- Social tax = 2,000 x 33% = **660.00**
- Unemployment insurance (employer) = 2,000 x 0.8% = **16.00**
- **Total employer cost** = 2,000 + 660.00 + 16.00 = **2,676.00**

**Classification:** Net pay EUR 1,647.72; employer pays EUR 660.00 social tax + EUR 16.00 UI; income tax withheld EUR 280.28. All declared on Form TSD by 10 April 2025. [EMTA, Income from employment; Social tax; Unemployment insurance premiums]

### Example 6 -- FIE Annual Computation (2025)

**Input:** Resident FIE, business income EUR 50,000, allowable business deductions EUR 20,000, no other income, born after 1982.

**Reasoning:**
- Business profit = 50,000 - 20,000 = **30,000.00** (Form E)
- Social tax = 30,000 x 33% = **9,900.00** (below the 2025 ceiling of 35,085.60). **Social tax is NOT deducted from the income-tax base.**
- Basic exemption: annual income 30,000 > 25,200, so basic exemption = **0** (2025 taper).
- Income tax = 30,000 x 22% = **6,600.00**
- **Total Estonian tax = 6,600.00 income tax + 9,900.00 social tax = 16,500.00**

**Classification:** Form E profit EUR 30,000.00; income tax EUR 6,600.00; social tax EUR 9,900.00. Quarterly advances paid during the year (4 x 811.80 = 3,247.20) are credited against the social-tax liability; the balance is settled on assessment. [EMTA, Self-employed -- income tax / social tax]

### Example 7 -- Entrepreneur Account (ettevõtluskonto)

**Input line:**
`10.05.2025 ; LHV ETTEVÕTLUSKONTO ; KLIENT MAKSE ; +500.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Receipts paid into an LHV entrepreneur account are taxed by a single **business income tax of 20% of gross receipts** (split 22/55 income tax + 33/55 social tax) -- this single charge covers both income tax and social tax. No expense deductions are allowed. The 40% rate for receipts over 25,000 EUR was abolished from 1 Jan 2025. Receipts are capped at 40,000 EUR/yr; above that the holder must register as a FIE or company. LHV deducts and remits the tax automatically.

**Tax on this receipt:** 500.00 x 20% = **100.00** (of which income tax 500 x 20% x 22/55 = 40.00; social tax 500 x 20% x 33/55 = 60.00). Check: 40.00 + 60.00 = **100.00**.

**Classification:** Entrepreneur-account business income tax EUR 100.00, remitted by LHV. No separate Form E. [EMTA, Entrepreneur account]

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Entrepreneur-account mechanics are bank-specific (LHV only); the 22%/24%/26% rate that applies when a 4%/6% funded-pension election is in place should be verified per individual before use. [EMTA, Entrepreneur account]

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Flat Rate and Scope

**Legislation:** Income Tax Act (Tulumaksuseadus, TuMS).

Personal income tax is a **flat 22%** for both 2025 and 2026 on all resident individual income. There are no brackets and no local income taxes. The planned 24% rate (2026) and the temporary defence/security tax were both cancelled. [EMTA, Tax rates; Estonian Chamber of Commerce]

### 5.2 Basic Exemption (maksuvaba tulu)

**Legislation:** Income Tax Act (TuMS).

| Scenario | Treatment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2025, income <= 14,400 | Full 7,848 EUR/yr | [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption] |
| 2025, income 14,400-25,200 | BE = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x (income - 14,400) | [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption] |
| 2025, income > 25,200 | EUR 0 | [EMTA, Calculation of basic exemption] |
| 2026, under pension age | Fixed 8,400 EUR/yr (700 EUR/mo) regardless of income -- "tax hump" abolished | [EMTA, Tax rates] |
| Pensionable age (both years) | Fixed 9,312 EUR/yr (776 EUR/mo), applied automatically by the Social Insurance Board | [EMTA, Tax rates] |

For payroll, the monthly exemption (max 654 EUR/mo in 2025; 700 EUR/mo in 2026) is applied by the employer only if the employee has filed an application with that employer; otherwise withhold 22% on full gross. [EMTA, Tax rates]

### 5.3 Social Tax (sotsiaalmaks)

**Legislation:** Social Tax Act (SMS).

- Rate **33%** (20% pension insurance + 13% health insurance). Paid by the employer on top of gross wage; FIE pay it on their own business profit. [EMTA, Social tax]
- Minimum monthly base 820 EUR in 2025 -> minimum obligation 270.60 EUR/mo. 2026 base 886 EUR -> 292.38 EUR/mo. [EMTA, Social tax]
- **No ceiling for employees.** FIE annual maximum = 35,085.60 EUR (2025). [EMTA, Self-employed -- social tax]
- **Social tax is not deductible** from the income-tax base.

### 5.4 Unemployment Insurance Premiums

**Legislation:** Unemployment Insurance Act.

| Premium | Rate | Payer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 1.6% | Employee (withheld) | Rate fixed 2025-2028; pensionable-age persons exempt; no ceiling |
| Employer | 0.8% | Employer | Still payable for pensionable-age workers; no ceiling |

FIE/self-employed are **not** subject to unemployment-insurance premiums. [EMTA, Unemployment insurance premiums]

### 5.5 Funded (II Pillar) Pension

**Legislation:** Funded Pensions Act.

- Default employee contribution **2%** (withheld); the state adds 4% from the 33% social tax. Members may elect **4%** or **6%** (since 1 Jan 2024). [PwC Estonia, Other taxes]
- Mandatory for residents born after 31 Dec 1982; voluntary otherwise. Always verify membership and elected rate in Pensionikeskus before assuming a rate.

### 5.6 FIE Business Income (Form E)

**Legislation:** Income Tax Act (TuMS); Social Tax Act (SMS).

1. Business profit = business income - allowable business deductions (Form E). Form E must be filed even if no business income was earned. [EMTA, Self-employed -- income tax]
2. Income tax = profit x 22%. Apply basic exemption per Section 5.2 (income-dependent in 2025).
3. Social tax = profit x 33%, subject to the 2025 annual ceiling of 35,085.60 EUR. Social tax is **not** deductible from the income-tax base.
4. Quarterly social-tax advances of 811.80 EUR each (2025) are due on the 15th of the last month of each quarter (15 Mar, 15 Jun, 15 Sep, 15 Dec), unless the FIE is exempt (student, pensioner, or simultaneously employed with Class 1 social tax paid). [EMTA, Self-employed -- income tax / social tax]

### 5.7 VAT Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT collected on sales (VAT-registered) | NOT income -- exclude from Form E business income |
| Input VAT recovered (VAT-registered) | NOT an expense -- exclude from deductions |
| Foreign VAT (non-reclaimable) | IS an expense -- full gross is the cost |

- **VAT standard rate 24%** (permanent from 1 July 2025; was 22% before). Reduced rates 13% (incl. accommodation from 1 Jan 2025) and 9%. [EMTA VAT pages; EY tax-changes alert]
- **VAT registration threshold:** mandatory registration once taxable turnover exceeds **40,000 EUR** in a calendar year; EU-wide SME cross-border threshold 100,000 EUR. [EMTA, Obligation to register]
- **VAT return (KMD):** due the 20th of the following month. [EMTA, Obligation to register]

### 5.8 Entrepreneur Account (ettevõtluskonto)

**Legislation:** Income Tax Act (TuMS).

A simplified regime taxing **amounts received** (gross receipts), bundling income tax + social tax. A single business income tax of **20%** of gross receipts (split 22/55 income tax + 33/55 social tax) covers both. No expense deductions.

| Funded-pension rate | Business income tax rate on receipts |
|---|---|
| Not contributing | 20% |
| Contributing 2% | 22% |
| Contributing 4% | 24% |
| Contributing 6% | 26% |

- The 40% rate for receipts over 25,000 EUR was abolished from 1 Jan 2025.
- Covers receipts up to **40,000 EUR/yr**. Above that, register as a FIE or company and become VAT-liable. Operated only via LHV Pank. [EMTA, Entrepreneur account]

### 5.9 Payroll (TSD) and Minimum Wage

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Income tax withholding | 22% monthly after applying the monthly basic exemption (max 654 EUR/mo in 2025) if the employee filed an application | [EMTA, Tax rates] |

| Minimum wage 2025 | 886 EUR/month; 5.31 EUR/hour | [ERR News; EMTA] |
| Minimum wage 2026 | 946 EUR/month; 5.67 EUR/hour (effective date to confirm -- see Section 1 research gap) | [ERR News] |

### 5.10 Filing Deadlines and Penalties

|---|---|---|
| Annual return (Form A + Form E) | File by 30 April following the tax year; e-filing opens 15 February | [EMTA, Income tax returns for 2025] |
| Additional income tax due (individual) | Payable by **1 October** of the year following the tax year | [EMTA, Income tax returns for 2025] |
| Refunds | Paid out from early March | [EMTA, Income tax returns for 2025] |
| Monthly employer return (TSD) | Due 10th of the following month | [EMTA, Income and social taxes] |

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction (FIE)

**Legislation:** Income Tax Act (TuMS) -- business-purpose test.

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room(s) as a percentage of total rooms or floor area).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity, water/gas, internet, and maintenance.
- Must be a genuinely dedicated workspace; a dual-use room does not qualify.
- Client must document the calculation and retain supporting records.

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the room arrangement.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm room count, floor-area basis, and that the workspace is genuinely dedicated.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use (FIE)

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and maintenance is deductible.
- Client must maintain a use/mileage log (business trips vs total).

**Conservative default:** 0% business use until a log is provided.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the business percentage is documented and reasonable.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; client must provide a reasonable estimate.

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Durable Business Asset Treatment (FIE)

- A FIE may deduct documented business expenses; the treatment of durable assets (immediate deduction vs spreading) was not researched in this skill.

**Conservative default:** Flag for reviewer; do not auto-deduct in full or auto-capitalise.

**Flag for reviewer:** [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm FIE durable-asset deduction mechanics with EMTA.]

### 6.5 Funded (II Pillar) Pension Rate

- Default 2% for residents born after 1982; members may have elected 4% or 6% since 1 Jan 2024. The entrepreneur-account tax rate (20/22/24/26%) depends on this election.

**Conservative default:** 2% (statutory default); 0% for non-members. Verify in Pensionikeskus before applying 4%/6%.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the individual's actual funded-pension rate before computing.

### 6.6 2025 Basic-Exemption Taper Band

- For 2025 income between 14,400 and 25,200, the exemption tapers by formula and is sensitive to **total** annual income (including non-FIE income).

**Conservative default:** Compute from the taper formula; if income > 25,200, BE = 0.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm total annual income from all sources before applying the 2025 taper.

### 6.7 Pensionable-Age Status

- The fixed 9,312 EUR exemption and the UI employee exemption depend on having reached pensionable age (born 1961 or earlier for the fixed exemption).

**Conservative default:** Assume not pensionable age unless confirmed.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm date of birth before applying any pensionable-age treatment.

### Important Distinction -- Two Separate EUR 886 Figures

| Figure | What it is | Year | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 886 EUR/month | Minimum **wage** (miinimumpalk) | 2025 | [ERR News; EMTA] |
| 886 EUR/month | Social-tax **monthly base** (820 EUR in 2025) | 2026 | [EMTA, Social tax] |

These coincide numerically but are **separate legal figures** and must not be conflated when wiring formulas.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee net pay (2025).**
Input: Gross 2,000 EUR/mo, born after 1982 (pension 2%), basic-exemption application filed (BE 654/mo), single employer.
Expected: UI 32.00, pension 40.00, income-tax base 1,274.00, income tax 280.28, **net pay 1,647.72**. Employer cost = 2,000 + 660.00 social tax + 16.00 UI = **2,676.00**.

**Test 2 -- Employee, no basic-exemption application (2025).**
Input: Gross 2,000 EUR/mo, born after 1982 (pension 2%), NO application filed.
Expected: UI 32.00, pension 40.00, income-tax base = 2,000 - 32 - 40 = 1,928.00, income tax = 1,928.00 x 22% = **424.16**, net pay = 2,000 - 32 - 40 - 424.16 = **1,503.84**.

**Test 3 -- FIE annual (2025), income above taper.**
Input: Business income 50,000, deductions 20,000, born after 1982, no other income.
Expected: profit 30,000; basic exemption 0 (income > 25,200); income tax = 30,000 x 22% = **6,600.00**; social tax = 30,000 x 33% = **9,900.00** (below cap); total Estonian tax **16,500.00**.

**Test 4 -- Basic exemption in the 2025 taper band.**
Input: 2025, total annual income 18,000 (single income stream).
Expected: BE = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x (18,000 - 14,400) = 7,848 - 7,848/10,800 x 3,600 = 7,848 - 2,616.00 = **5,232.00**. Income-tax base = 18,000 - 5,232.00 = 12,768.00; income tax = 12,768.00 x 22% = **2,808.96**.

**Test 5 -- Basic exemption 2026 (fixed) vs 2025 (taper).**
Input: 2026, under pension age, total income 45,000 (FIE net 32,000 + employment 13,000).
Expected: 2026 basic exemption = **8,400** (fixed, no taper); income-tax base = 45,000 - 8,400 = 36,600.00; income tax = 36,600.00 x 22% = **8,052.00**. (In 2025 the exemption would have been 0 because income > 25,200.)

**Test 6 -- Pensionable-age exemption (2026).**
Input: 2026, pensionable age, total income 12,000 (pension + small FIE).
Expected: basic exemption = **9,312** (pensionable age, fixed); income-tax base = 12,000 - 9,312 = 2,688.00; income tax = 2,688.00 x 22% = **591.36**.

**Test 7 -- Entrepreneur account (2025).**
Input: 2025, entrepreneur account, receipts 30,000, no 4%/6% pension election.
Expected: business income tax = 30,000 x 20% = **6,000.00** (bundles income tax + social tax). Below 40,000 -- no FIE/company registration required. (40% rate over 25,000 abolished from 1 Jan 2025.)

**Test 8 -- FIE social-tax ceiling (2025).**
Input: Business profit 120,000.
Expected: uncapped social tax = 120,000 x 33% = 39,600.00, but it is **capped at 35,085.60**; income tax = 120,000 x 22% = **26,400.00** (basic exemption 0).

**Test 9 -- Restaurant / personal blocked (FIE).**
Input: 2025, FIE, EUR 64.20 supermarket purchase claimed as expense.
Expected: remove from Form E. Not deductible -- private living cost.

**Test 10 -- Social tax not deductible.**
Input: FIE attempts to deduct social tax of 9,900 from profit before computing income tax.
Expected: reject. Social tax is not deductible from the income-tax base; income tax is computed on profit before social tax.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute Estonian tax without confirming residency (resident vs non-resident)
- NEVER apply the monthly basic exemption in payroll unless the employee filed an application with that employer
