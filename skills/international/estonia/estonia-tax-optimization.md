description: >
  Use this skill whenever asked about reducing tax in Estonia, tax planning, saving tax, or legal strategies to minimise tax for a self-employed person, freelancer, or small company in Estonia. Trigger on phrases like "reduce tax Estonia", "0% corporate tax", "retained profits", "FIE vs OÜ", "OÜ tax", "ettevõtluskonto", "entrepreneur account", "salary vs dividend Estonia", "distributed profits", "participation exemption", "Estonian holding company", "save tax Estonia", "tax planning Estonia". This skill covers the entity-choice / profit-deferral decision (FIE vs OÜ vs entrepreneur account), the 0%-on-retained-profits system, salary-vs-dividend mix, the distributed-profits CIT, the basic exemption, the II-pillar election, the holding/participation exemption, and the anti-avoidance red lines. ALWAYS read this skill before advising on any Estonian tax optimisation.

# Estonia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: Estonian Tax and Customs Board (EMTA), PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, Invest in Estonia. Figures must agree with `estonia-income-tax.md` / `estonia-social-contributions.md`. NOT yet signed off by an Estonian tax adviser. Every suggestion must be reviewed by a credentialed professional; aggressive positions are never advised.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Republic of Estonia |
| Currency | EUR |
| Personal income tax | Flat **22%** (2025 & 2026) |
| Corporate tax (OÜ) | **0% on retained/undistributed profits**; **22%** on distribution (computed as 22/78 of the net amount). The reduced 14% rate on regular dividends was **abolished from 1 Jan 2025**. (EMTA; PwC) |
| Social tax | 33% on employment/board remuneration (funds pension + health) |
| Key optimisation levers | Entity choice & profit deferral (OÜ 0% retained); salary-vs-dividend mix; entrepreneur account for micro income; participation exemption for holdings |
| Anti-avoidance | EMTA expects a market-rate salary for active owner-managers; substance required for holding structures |

> **The single biggest Estonian lever is the OÜ deferral:** profits kept inside an OÜ are taxed at **0%** until distributed. Reinvest, and you never trigger the 22% — this is legitimate deferral, not avoidance.

---

## Section 2 -- Entity Choice & Profit Deferral (the core decision)

| Structure | Best when | Tax treatment |
|---|---|---|
| **OÜ** (private limited co.) | Profits reinvested/retained; want liability protection; building value | **0% on retained profit**; 22% (22/78) only when distributed as dividends; owner-manager can take salary |
| **FIE** (sole proprietor) | Small, simple, want income in own hands now | Business income taxed currently (22% PIT + social tax); **no deferral**; unlimited personal liability |
| **Ettevõtluskonto** (entrepreneur account) | Micro / side income, services to private individuals, no expenses | A single flat % of turnover is withheld automatically by the bank; no bookkeeping, no deductions. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current account tax rate and turnover cap.]** |

**The deferral play.** An OÜ that retains earnings to fund hiring, equipment, or expansion pays **no** corporate tax at that stage. Tax (22%) arises only on distribution. For anyone reinvesting, the OÜ massively beats the FIE (which is taxed currently). **Most growing businesses should be an OÜ.**

---

## Section 3 -- Salary vs Dividend (OÜ owner-managers)

| Route | Cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Board-member / employee salary** | 22% PIT + **33% social tax**; deductible for the OÜ; builds pension + health cover | Required to a reasonable level if you actively work |
| **Dividend** | 22% (22/78) distributed-profits CIT; **no social tax**; no pension/health build | Cheaper headline, but… |

**The optimisation:** pay a **reasonable market salary** for the work performed (covers health insurance + pension), then distribute the rest as dividends to avoid the 33% social tax on profit. 

> **AUDIT FLASH POINT.** Taking *all* remuneration as dividends while actively working to dodge the 33% social tax is a known EMTA challenge area — they expect a market-rate salary. Set salary defensibly; document it. Never advise zero-salary-all-dividend for an active owner.

---

## Section 4 -- Deductions & Expenses (Estonia works differently)

Estonia has **no annual profit-tax computation**, so "deductible expenses" don't reduce a yearly tax bill the way they do elsewhere — instead, genuine business expenses are simply **not taxed**, while non-business spending becomes a taxable fringe benefit or deemed distribution.

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Genuine business expenses | Tax-free if wholly business-related and documented |
| Fringe benefits (private use of company assets) | Taxed (income tax + social tax) — keep business/private clean |
| Entertainment / representation | Limited monthly tax-free allowance that **scales with payroll** (small for a solo OÜ, larger with employees) — excess is taxed. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current allowance formula.]** |
| Business gifts / donations | Specific tax-free limits apply |

---

## Section 5 -- Reliefs & Personal Allowances

| Relief | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Basic exemption (maksuvaba tulu)** | 2025: up to €7,848/yr, **income-tapered** (phases out €14,400–25,200). **2026: fixed €8,400/yr, taper abolished.** (per `estonia-income-tax.md`) |
| **II-pillar funded pension** | Default 2%; member may **elect 4% or 6%** — higher election increases retirement saving (consider cash-flow vs long-term benefit). |
| Pensionable-age exemption | Higher basic exemption (€9,312/yr) for those of pensionable age. |

> The 2025 taper creates a "tax hump" (~€14,400–25,200) where the marginal rate is effectively higher; timing income across years near that band can help. Abolished from 2026.

---

## Section 6 -- Holding / Participation Exemption

- Dividends an OÜ **receives** from a subsidiary in which it holds **≥ 10%** are generally exempt, and can flow up without further Estonian tax on redistribution. This makes Estonia a legitimate **EU holding location**.
- **AUDIT FLASH POINT** — a holding structure must have genuine substance; a letterbox holding purely for tax can be challenged under EU ATAD / GAAR principles. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current participation-exemption conditions and minimum holding period.]**

---

## Section 7 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Market-salary expectation:** active owner-managers must take a reasonable salary; all-dividend-no-salary is a flagged avoidance pattern.
- **Substance for holdings:** participation exemption needs real economic substance.
- **Business vs private:** mislabelling private spending as business creates taxable fringe benefits/distributions, not deductions.
- Never present the OÜ 0%-retained system as "no tax" — it is **deferral**; 22% applies on distribution.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER advise an active owner-manager to take zero salary and only dividends to avoid social tax.
- NEVER describe Estonia's OÜ regime as tax-free — it is 0% on RETAINED profit only; distributions are taxed at 22% (22/78).
- NEVER assume the abolished 14% reduced dividend rate still applies (gone from 1 Jan 2025).
- NEVER advise a substance-free holding company to exploit the participation exemption.
- NEVER contradict the rates/exemptions in `estonia-income-tax.md` / `estonia-social-contributions.md`.
- NEVER present optimisation suggestions as definitive advice — always route to a licensed Estonian tax adviser.
