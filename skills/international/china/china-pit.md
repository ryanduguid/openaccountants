## Section 7 — Worked example

**Scenario:** Employee in Beijing, annual salary ¥360,000, one child in school, housing loan (first home), caring for elderly parent (only child). Social insurance + housing fund deducted at source ≈ ¥4,500/month.

| Step | Description | Amount (¥) |
|---|---|---|
| Annual salary | | 360,000 |
| − Standard deduction | ¥5,000 × 12 | (60,000) |
| − Social insurance | ¥4,500 × 12 | (54,000) |
| − Children's education | ¥2,000 × 12 | (24,000) |
| − Housing loan interest | ¥1,000 × 12 | (12,000) |
| − Elderly care | ¥3,000 × 12 | (36,000) |
| **Taxable income** | | **174,000** |

Tax on ¥174,000:
- ¥174,000 × 20% − ¥16,920 = **¥17,880**

If monthly withholding totaled ¥18,500 during the year → refund of **¥620**.
