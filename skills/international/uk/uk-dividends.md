### Dividend Tax Rates (2024-25)

| Tax band | Rate on dividends above allowance |
|---|---|
| Basic rate (£12,571--£50,270) | 8.75% |
| Higher rate (£50,271--£125,140) | 33.75% |
| Additional rate (over £125,140) | 39.35% |

### Dividend Tax Rates (2025-26)

| Tax band | Rate on dividends above allowance |
|---|---|
| Basic rate (£12,571--£50,270) | 8.75% |
| Higher rate (£50,271--£125,140) | 33.75% |
| Additional rate (over £125,140) | 39.35% |

### Dividend Tax Rates (2026-27) — from 6 April 2026

Announced at Autumn Budget 2025 and enacted via Finance (No. 2) Bill 2024-26. Basic and higher rates increase by 2 percentage points; the additional rate is unchanged. The £500 dividend allowance is unchanged for 2026-27, and the income tax bands remain frozen through 2027-28 (Personal Allowance £12,570; basic rate band cap £50,270; additional rate threshold £125,140).

| Tax band | Rate on dividends above allowance |
|---|---|
| Basic rate (£12,571--£50,270) | 10.75% |
| Higher rate (£50,271--£125,140) | 35.75% |
| Additional rate (over £125,140) | 39.35% |

### Combined Comparison — All Three Years

| Band | 2024-25 | 2025-26 | 2026-27 |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic rate | 8.75% | 8.75% | 10.75% |
| Higher rate | 33.75% | 33.75% | 35.75% |
| Additional rate | 39.35% | 39.35% | 39.35% |
| Dividend allowance | £500 | £500 | £500 |

### Dividend Allowance History

| Tax year | Allowance |
|---|---|
| 2024-25 | £500 |
| 2025-26 | £500 |
| 2023-24 | £1,000 |
| 2022-23 | £2,000 |
| 2021-22 | £2,000 |
| 2017-18 to 2020-21 | £2,000 |
| 2016-17 | £5,000 |

### How the Dividend Allowance Works

- The first £500 of dividend income in the tax year is taxed at 0% (the "dividend nil rate")
- The allowance does NOT reduce taxable income — it is a nil-rate band
- Dividends above £500 are taxed at the dividend rate for the taxpayer's band
- The £500 still counts towards total income for determining which band other income/dividends fall into
- Cannot be transferred to a spouse; cannot be carried forward
- Applies per person, not per source

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown income band | STOP — dividend tax rate depends on total income |
| Unknown whether UK or foreign dividend | Treat as UK (no withholding tax complication) |
| Unknown whether dividend is from own company | STOP — affects IR35/salary-vs-dividend analysis |
| Unknown dividend waiver | Ignore waiver (full entitlement taxable) |

## Section 2 -- Computation Rules

### 2.1 Order of Taxation

Income is taxed in this statutory order:
1. Non-savings income (employment, self-employment, property, pensions)
2. Savings income (interest)
3. Dividend income (last)

This means dividends sit on top of all other income. A taxpayer with £45,000 salary has only £5,270 of basic rate band remaining (£50,270 - £45,000) before dividends push into the higher rate band.

### 2.2 Full Computation

```
Step 1: Calculate total income from all sources
Step 2: Deduct personal allowance (£12,570) from non-savings income first
Step 3: Apply non-savings rates to non-savings income
Step 4: Apply savings rates to savings income (including PSA)
Step 5: Apply dividend rates to dividend income

Dividend tax:
  First £500: 0% (dividend allowance)
  Remainder in basic rate band: 8.75%
  Remainder in higher rate band: 33.75%
  Remainder in additional rate band: 39.35%
```

### 2.3 Personal Allowance Reduction

If adjusted net income exceeds £100,000, the personal allowance is reduced by £1 for every £2 above £100,000. It is fully withdrawn at £125,140. Dividends count towards adjusted net income for this purpose, creating an effective marginal rate of ~60% in the £100,000--£125,140 band.

## Section 3 -- Company Director: Salary vs Dividends Optimisation

### 3.1 The Core Trade-Off

| Payment type | Corporation Tax | Employee NIC | Employer NIC | Income Tax | Net in pocket |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Salary | Deductible (reduces CT) | 8% (above £12,570) + 2% (above £50,270) | 13.8% (above £9,100) | 20%/40%/45% | Lower gross, but CT saved |
| Dividend | NOT deductible (paid from post-CT profits) | None | None | 8.75%/33.75%/39.35% | No NIC, but CT already paid |

### 3.2 Optimal Strategy (2024-25, Single Director-Shareholder)

| Component | Amount | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Salary | £12,570 (PA level) | Tax-free; employer NIC: 13.8% × (£12,570 - £9,100) = £479; CT deduction saves 25% × £12,570 = £3,143 |
| Dividends | Remainder of profits | 0% on first £500; 8.75% on remainder within basic rate band |
| NIC threshold salary alternative | £9,100 (Secondary Threshold) | Zero employer NIC; small sacrifice of personal allowance |

**Optimal for most single directors:** Salary at £12,570, dividends for the rest up to the basic rate band limit. Beyond basic rate, the combined CT + dividend tax rate increases. The strategy above is calibrated to the 2024-25 tax year (rates unchanged for 2025-26).

**2026-27 impact:** The Autumn Budget 2025 dividend hike (basic 8.75% → 10.75%; higher 33.75% → 35.75%) narrows the dividend advantage over salary, particularly for higher-rate director-shareholders. The combined CT + higher-rate dividend cost rises from ~50.28% to ~51.78%, eroding most of the gap against the salary route. Single directors should still favour salary at the Primary Threshold plus dividends, but the savings vs. a pure-salary extraction will be materially smaller from 6 April 2026 — re-run the comparison annually.

### 3.3 Combined Effective Rates (2024-25)

| Income band | Salary effective rate | Dividend effective rate |
|---|---|---|
| Up to PA (£12,570) | NIC only (employer) | 0% (within PA + allowance) |
| Basic rate | 20% IT + 8% NIC + 13.8% ER NIC = ~34.25% (offset by CT deduction) | 25% CT + 8.75% on remainder = ~32.19% combined |
| Higher rate | 40% IT + 2% NIC + 13.8% ER NIC = ~49.03% (offset by CT deduction) | 25% CT + 33.75% on remainder = ~50.28% combined |
| Additional rate | 45% IT + 2% NIC + 13.8% ER NIC = ~53.43% (offset by CT deduction) | 25% CT + 39.35% on remainder = ~54.51% combined |

### 3.4 Important Caveats

- Salary must be commercially justifiable (not artificially low to avoid NIC)
- HMRC can challenge under employment intermediaries legislation
- Director must draw a proper employment contract
- Salary below the Lower Earnings Limit (£6,396 for 2024-25) means no qualifying year for State Pension — consider paying at least this level
- Dividends require distributable profits — cannot pay dividends from a loss-making company

## Section 4 -- Foreign Dividends

### 4.1 Reporting

- Foreign dividends are reported on the SA106 (Foreign) supplementary pages, or SA100 Box 5 if straightforward
- Report the gross amount (before foreign tax deducted)
- Convert to GBP at the exchange rate on the date the dividend was paid (or the rate used by the paying agent)

### 4.2 Double Tax Relief (DTR)

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| Treaty relief | Credit for foreign tax paid, limited to UK tax on the same income |
| Unilateral relief | Available even without a treaty (ITA 2007 s. 18) — credit for foreign tax up to UK tax |
| Maximum credit | Lower of: foreign tax paid, or UK tax attributable to the foreign income |
| Excess foreign tax | Cannot be carried forward or refunded; effectively wasted |

### 4.3 Common Foreign Dividend Withholding Rates

| Country | Typical WHT on dividends | Treaty rate (to UK) |
|---|---|---|
| USA | 30% (statutory) | 15% (treaty) |
| Ireland | 25% | 15% |
| France | 25% | 15% |
| Germany | 26.375% (incl. Soli) | 15% |
| Australia | 0% (franked) / 30% (unfranked) | 15% |
| Canada | 25% | 15% |

### 4.4 US Dividends and W-8BEN

UK residents receiving US dividends should file Form W-8BEN with their US broker to claim the 15% treaty rate (instead of 30%). The 15% US withholding tax is then credited against UK dividend tax via DTR.

## Section 5 -- Transaction Pattern Library

### 5.1 Dividend Income Patterns (Credits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DIVIDEND, DIV PAYMENT, INTERIM DIV, FINAL DIV | UK dividend income | Report gross amount on SA100 Box 4 |
| [Company name] DIVIDEND VOUCHER | UK dividend income | Voucher is the primary evidence — retain |
| HARGREAVES LANSDOWN DIV, AJ BELL DIV, FIDELITY | UK dividend income | Platform-held investments; platforms provide tax certificate |
| VANGUARD DISTRIBUTION, ISHARES DISTRIBUTION | UK dividend income (if UK fund) | Check if income or accumulation units |
| FOREIGN DIV, OVERSEAS DIVIDEND, USD PAYMENT | Foreign dividend | Report on SA106; convert to GBP; claim DTR |
| REIT DIVIDEND, PROPERTY INCOME DISTRIBUTION | UK PID — taxed as property income | NOT taxed as dividend — treated as property income at normal rates |
| SCRIP DIVIDEND, STOCK DIVIDEND | UK dividend | Taxable at the cash equivalent value |

### 5.2 Exclusions

| Pattern | Treatment |
|---|---|
| CAPITAL RETURN, RETURN OF CAPITAL | NOT dividend income — reduces cost base for CGT |
| ISA DIVIDEND | EXEMPT — no tax reporting required |
| PENSION FUND DIVIDEND | Not directly taxable to individual (within pension wrapper) |

## Section 6 -- Dividend Waivers

A shareholder may waive their right to a dividend. This is typically used in family company planning.

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Must be a deed of waiver | Executed before the dividend is declared |
| Must be unconditional | Cannot be conditional on another shareholder receiving more |
| Settlement legislation (ITTOIA s. 624) | If waiver is an "arrangement" to divert income to spouse, HMRC can tax the waiving shareholder |
| HMRC scrutiny | Waivers are commonly challenged; must have genuine commercial purpose |
| Safe approach | Waiver of all shares of one class, well in advance of dividend declaration |

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Basic Rate Taxpayer

**Input:** Employment income £30,000. UK dividends received £8,000. No other income.

**Computation:**
```
Total income: £38,000
Personal allowance: £12,570
Taxable non-savings: £17,430 (at 20% = £3,486)
Remaining basic rate band: £50,270 - £30,000 = £20,270

Dividend tax:
  First £500: 0%                = £0
  Remaining £7,500: 8.75%       = £656.25

Total dividend tax: £656.25
```

### Example 1b -- Same Scenario Under 2026-27 Rates

**Input:** Same as Example 1 — Employment income £30,000, UK dividends £8,000, no other income — but for the 2026-27 tax year (from 6 April 2026).

**Computation:**
```
Total income: £38,000
Personal allowance: £12,570 (unchanged — frozen through 2027-28)
Taxable non-savings: £17,430 (at 20% = £3,486)
Remaining basic rate band: £50,270 - £30,000 = £20,270

Dividend tax (2026-27 rates):
  First £500: 0%                = £0
  Remaining £7,500: 10.75%      = £806.25

Total dividend tax: £806.25
```

**Cost of the rate hike:** £806.25 − £656.25 = **£150 extra** on the same £8,000 of dividends, purely from the basic rate moving from 8.75% to 10.75%. A higher-rate taxpayer in the same position would see proportionally larger increases at 35.75% vs 33.75%.

### Example 2 -- Dividend Straddling Basic/Higher Rate

**Input:** Salary £48,000. UK dividends £10,000.

**Computation:**
```
Taxable salary: £48,000 - £12,570 = £35,430
Remaining basic rate band: £50,270 - £48,000 = £2,270

Dividend tax:
  First £500: 0%                        = £0
  Next £1,770 (fills basic rate band): 8.75% = £154.88
  Remaining £7,730: 33.75%              = £2,608.88

Total dividend tax: £2,763.76
```

### Example 3 -- Director Salary + Dividends

**Input:** Company profit before salary: £60,000. Director takes £12,570 salary, rest as dividends. Corporation Tax 25%.

**Computation:**
```
Company:
  Profit: £60,000
  Salary: £12,570 (deductible)
  Employer NIC: 13.8% × (£12,570 - £9,100) = £479 (deductible)
  Taxable profit: £60,000 - £12,570 - £479 = £46,951
  Corporation Tax: £46,951 × 25% = £11,738
  Available for dividends: £46,951 - £11,738 = £35,213

Director:
  Salary: £12,570 (covered by PA = £0 IT)
  Employee NIC: 8% × (£12,570 - £12,570) = £0
  Dividends: £35,213
    First £500: 0%
    Next £37,200 remaining basic rate band: 8.75% on £34,713 = £3,037.39

Total tax paid (company + personal): £11,738 + £479 + £3,037.39 = £15,254.39
Total extracted: £12,570 + £35,213 = £47,783
Effective combined rate: 24.2%
```

### Example 4 -- Foreign Dividends with DTR

**Input:** US dividends $5,000 (GBP equivalent £3,950). US withholding tax 15% = $750 (£593). Higher rate UK taxpayer.

**Computation:**
```
Gross foreign dividend: £3,950
UK tax at 33.75%: £3,950 × 33.75% = £1,333.13
(Less dividend allowance applied: £500 × 33.75% saving = £168.75)
Adjusted: (£3,950 - £500) × 33.75% = £1,164.38
DTR credit: £593 (limited to UK tax on the foreign income)
UK tax payable: £1,164.38 - £593 = £571.38
```

## Section 8 -- Edge Cases

### 8.1 Accumulation Units in Funds
Income within accumulation units is still taxable to the investor — even though no cash is received. The fund manager issues a tax voucher showing the notional distribution. This is often overlooked.

### 8.2 Dividends vs Interest from Corporate Bonds
Returns from corporate bonds are interest (savings income), not dividends. Taxed at savings rates with the Personal Savings Allowance (£1,000 basic / £500 higher / £0 additional). Do not confuse with dividend rates.

### 8.3 REIT Dividends
Property Income Distributions (PIDs) from UK REITs are taxed as property income at normal income tax rates (20%/40%/45%), NOT at dividend rates. The dividend allowance does NOT apply to PIDs. The ordinary part of a REIT dividend is taxed as a normal dividend.

### 8.4 Close Company Loans (Section 455)
If a director borrows from their close company, the company pays Section 455 tax (33.75%). If the loan is written off, the director is taxed as if receiving a dividend. The Section 455 tax is refunded to the company.

### 8.5 Dividend in Specie
A company can pay a dividend by transferring an asset (not cash). The dividend value is the market value of the asset. The company may have a Corporation Tax liability on the disposal of the asset.

## Section 9 -- Filing Requirements

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Total dividends ≤ £500 | No Self Assessment required (covered by allowance) |
| Total dividends > £500, all UK, basic rate taxpayer | May need to complete SA100; HMRC may collect via Simple Assessment or PAYE code adjustment |
| Higher/additional rate taxpayer with dividends | Must file SA100 |
| Foreign dividends of any amount | Must file SA100 + SA106 |
| Company director taking dividends | Must file SA100 |

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply dividend rates to REIT Property Income Distributions — they are taxed at normal income tax rates
- NEVER carry forward or transfer the unused dividend allowance
- NEVER ignore the Personal Allowance taper for incomes between £100,000 and £125,140
- NEVER pay dividends without distributable reserves — this is a Companies Act breach
- NEVER apply the dividend allowance to ISA dividends — ISA income is already exempt
- NEVER forget that dividends still count as income for threshold purposes (PA taper, child benefit charge, student loan)
- NEVER advise on salary-vs-dividends without checking State Pension qualifying year implications
- NEVER present dividend tax computations as definitive — always label as estimated
