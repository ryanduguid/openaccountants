## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1 -- Standard Monthly Employee (Category A)

Gross salary £3,500/month. Tax code 1257L.

1. PAYE: (£3,500 × 12 - £12,570) × 20% ÷ 12 = £595.50/month (cumulative calc)
2. Employee NIC: (£3,500 - £1,048) × 8% = £196.16/month
3. Employer NIC: (£3,500 - £417) × 15% = £462.45/month
4. Auto-enrolment pension (employee): (£3,500 - £520) × 5% = £149.00
5. Auto-enrolment pension (employer): (£3,500 - £520) × 3% = £89.40

### Pattern 2 -- Director NIC Calculation

Directors may use either the annual earnings period method (standard) or the alternative method (cumulative per pay period). The annual method defers NIC until cumulative earnings exceed the annual threshold. Most payroll software defaults to the annual method; the alternative method requires explicit election.

### Pattern 3 -- Starter with No P45

Apply HMRC starter checklist. Use one of three statements:
- A: First job since 6 April -- apply 1257L on cumulative basis
- B: Currently has another job -- apply BR
- C: Has another source of income -- apply BR

### Pattern 4 -- Statutory Payment Recovery

Standard employers recover 92% of SMP/SAP/ShPP/SPBP/SNCP. Small employers (Class 1 NIC ≤ £45,000 in qualifying year) recover 100% + 9% compensation (109% total from Apr 2026). SSP cannot be recovered.
