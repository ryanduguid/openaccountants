| Unknown cost basis | STOP — cannot compute gain without omkostnadsbelopp |
| Unknown whether personal NFT or investment NFT | Treat as kapitalplacering (K4 avsnitt D — taxable at 30%) |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — affects worldwide taxation obligation |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap classification | Treat as taxable disposal (avyttring) |

---

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Crypto as "Andra Tillgångar" (Other Assets)

Skatteverket classifies all cryptocurrency (kryptovalutor/kryptotillgångar) as "andra tillgångar" (other assets) for capital gains purposes. They are **not** classified as currency, securities, or financial instruments under Swedish tax law.

**Key legislative references:**
- Inkomstskattelagen (IL) Chapter 44 — general capital gains provisions
- IL Chapter 48 — specific rules for "andra tillgångar"
- IL Chapter 41 § 1–2 — income from capital (inkomst av kapital)

### 2.2 Taxable Events

| Event | Taxable? | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Selling crypto for SEK/fiat | Yes | Capital gain/loss, K4 avsnitt D |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap (e.g. BTC → ETH) | Yes | Disposal of first crypto; acquisition of second |
| Paying for goods/services with crypto | Yes | Disposal at market value in SEK at payment date |
| Receiving salary in crypto | Yes | Employment income (inkomst av tjänst) at FMV when received |
| Mining rewards | Yes | Income at FMV when received (see Section 5) |
| Staking rewards | Yes | Interest income (ränteinkomst) at FMV when received |
| Lending crypto (e.g. DeFi lending) | Yes | Transfer to lending protocol is likely a disposal |
| Receiving airdrop | Depends | Taxable if received for a service; gratuitous may not be taxable until sold |
| Transfer between own wallets | No | Not a disposal — no tax event |
| HODLing (holding without selling) | No | No tax event until disposal |

### 2.3 No Trading vs Investment Distinction

Unlike Malta and some other jurisdictions, Sweden does **not** distinguish between trading and investment for crypto taxation purposes. All crypto capital gains are taxed at the flat 30% rate regardless of holding period or trading frequency. There is no "investor exemption" for long-term holders.

---

## Section 3 -- Rate Tables

### 3.1 Capital Income Tax (Inkomst av Kapital)

| Type | Rate | Citation |
|---|---|---|
| Capital gains on crypto | 30% flat | IL Chapter 65 § 7 |
| Loss deduction on crypto | 70% of loss deductible | IL Chapter 48 § 24, Chapter 44 |
| Interest income (staking/lending) | 30% flat | IL Chapter 42 |

### 3.2 Capital Loss Offset Rules

| Scenario | Deduction Rate |
|---|---|
| Crypto loss against crypto gain (same category — andra tillgångar) | 100% offset within category |
| Net loss in andra tillgångar against other capital income | 70% deductible |
| Net capital income deficit ≤ SEK 100,000 | 30% skattereduktion (tax credit against municipal tax) |
| Net capital income deficit > SEK 100,000 | 30% on first SEK 100,000 + 21% on excess |

**Citation:** IL Chapter 67 § 10; Skatteverket "Belopp och procent — inkomstår 2025"

### 3.3 Earned Income Tax (Mining/Business Activity)

If mining or other crypto activity is classified as earned income (inkomst av tjänst or inkomst av näringsverksamhet):

| Component | Rate (Income Year 2025) |
|---|---|
| Municipal tax (kommunalskatt) | Average 32.41% (varies 28.98%–35.30% by municipality) |
| State income tax (statlig inkomstskatt) | 20% on taxable income above SEK 625,800 |
| Maximum marginal rate | ~52.41% (32.41% + 20%) |
| General pension contribution (allmän pensionsavgift) | 7% on earned income (capped; offset by tax credit) |

**Citation:** Skatteverket "Belopp och procent — inkomstår 2025"; SCB kommunalskatter 2025

---

## Section 4 -- Cost Basis Methods

### 4.1 Genomsnittsmetoden (Average Cost Method) — MANDATORY

Skatteverket **requires** the average cost method for cryptocurrency. FIFO and specific identification are **not** permitted for crypto.

**How it works:**

1. Add up all acquisition costs (inkl. fees) for the same cryptocurrency
2. Divide by total number of coins/units purchased
3. This gives the average omkostnadsbelopp (cost basis) per unit
4. On each disposal, the cost basis per unit × number sold = deductible amount

**Critical rules:**
- Calculated **separately** for each type of cryptocurrency (BTC separate from ETH separate from SOL, etc.)
- All acquisitions across **all** exchanges and wallets are pooled together for the same cryptocurrency
- Mining/staking rewards enter the pool at FMV on the date received
- Exchange fees and transaction fees are included in the acquisition cost

### 4.2 Cost Basis Formula

```
Total omkostnadsbelopp = Σ (acquisition cost per purchase + fees)
Average cost per unit  = Total omkostnadsbelopp ÷ Total units acquired
Gain/Loss per disposal = Sale proceeds − (Average cost per unit × Units sold)
```

### 4.3 Example: Average Cost Calculation

```
Purchase 1:  2.0 BTC at SEK 250,000 each = SEK 500,000 + SEK 1,000 fee
Purchase 2:  1.0 BTC at SEK 400,000      = SEK 400,000 + SEK 500 fee
Staking:     0.1 BTC received, FMV        = SEK 35,000

Total cost:  SEK 500,000 + 1,000 + 400,000 + 500 + 35,000 = SEK 936,500
Total units: 2.0 + 1.0 + 0.1 = 3.1 BTC
Average:     SEK 936,500 ÷ 3.1 = SEK 302,096.77 per BTC

Sale of 1.5 BTC at SEK 450,000 each:
  Proceeds: 1.5 × SEK 450,000 = SEK 675,000
  Cost:     1.5 × SEK 302,096.77 = SEK 453,145.16
  Gain:     SEK 221,854.84
  Tax:      SEK 221,854.84 × 30% = SEK 66,556.45
```

## Section 5 -- DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrop Treatment

### 5.1 Mining

| Scale | Classification | Tax Treatment | Citation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private/hobby scale | Inkomst av tjänst (hobby) | Taxed at FMV when mined; municipal + state income tax rates | Skatteverket guidance on mining (kryptovalutor) |
| Commercial/business scale | Inkomst av näringsverksamhet | Business income; deduct hardware, electricity, and operating costs; social contributions apply | IL Chapter 13 |

**Determining hobby vs business:** Skatteverket considers continuity, scale, profit motive, and organisation. Most individual miners are classified as hobby.

**Cost basis of mined coins:** The amount declared as income becomes the cost basis (omkostnadsbelopp) for future capital gains calculations.

### 5.2 Staking

Skatteverket treats staking rewards as **ränteinkomst** (interest income) within inkomst av kapital, taxed at 30% when received.

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Tax point | When rewards are received/accessible |
| Valuation | FMV in SEK at receipt date |
| Tax rate | 30% (capital income) |
| Cost basis for future sale | FMV at receipt date |
| Reporting | Inkomstdeklaration 1, punkt 7.2 (Ränteinkomster) |

### 5.3 DeFi Lending

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Depositing crypto into lending protocol | Likely a **disposal** (avyttring) — capital gain/loss triggered |
| Interest received from lending | Interest income (ränteinkomst) at 30% |
| Withdrawing from lending protocol | New acquisition at FMV |

**Warning:** Skatteverket's position is that transferring crypto to a lending platform (e.g. Celsius, Aave) where the lender receives the right to use/lend the crypto constitutes a disposal. This was confirmed in guidance related to the Celsius bankruptcy (2025).

### 5.4 Liquidity Providing (LP)

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Adding crypto to LP | Likely disposal of underlying assets; LP tokens acquired at FMV |
| LP token received | New asset — cost basis = FMV of assets deposited |
| Withdrawing from LP | Disposal of LP tokens; reacquired underlying assets at FMV |
| Impermanent loss | Not separately deductible — reflected in gain/loss on LP token disposal |

**Flag for reviewer:** LP treatment remains uncertain. Skatteverket has not issued comprehensive LP-specific guidance.

### 5.5 Airdrops

| Type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Gratuitous airdrop (no action required) | Cost basis = SEK 0; taxed as capital gain only when sold |
| Airdrop received for a service/action (e.g. testnet participation, governance vote) | Income at FMV when received; cost basis = income amount declared |

### 5.6 Hard Forks

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Original coin | Cost basis unchanged |
| New forked coin | Cost basis = SEK 0 |
| Sale of forked coin | Full proceeds = capital gain |

---

## Section 6 -- NFT Treatment

Skatteverket has published specific NFT guidance (Beskattning av NFT, Non fungible token). Two possible classifications:

### 6.1 NFT as Capital Placement (Kapitalplacering)

Applies when the NFT is purchased as a speculative investment.

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Reporting | K4 avsnitt D (samma som kryptovalutor) |
| Gain | Taxed at 30% |
| Loss | 70% deductible |
| Cost basis | Acquisition price in SEK + fees |

### 6.2 NFT as Personal Property (Personlig tillgång)

Applies when the NFT is purchased for personal enjoyment (e.g. profile picture, digital art for personal use).

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Reporting | Punkt 7.5 in Inkomstdeklaration, using hjälpblankett SKV 2192 |
| Gain exemption | First SEK 50,000 of aggregate personal property gains per year is tax-free |
| Loss | NOT deductible |
| Alternative cost basis | 25% of sale price (schablonavdrag) may be used |

**Citation:** Skatteverket — "Beskattning av NFT, Non fungible token" (SKV guidance)

### 6.3 NFT Creation and Sale

If the taxpayer creates and sells NFTs as a regular activity, income may be classified as inkomst av näringsverksamhet (business income) subject to full marginal rates and social contributions.

---

## Section 7 -- Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Forms and Filing

| Form | Purpose | Section |
|---|---|---|
| Inkomstdeklaration 1 | Main personal tax return | Filed annually |
| Bilaga K4 — Avsnitt D | Cryptocurrency gains/losses (övriga tillgångar) | Aggregate gains and losses per crypto type |
| Punkt 7.2 | Interest income (staking/lending income) | In main declaration |
| Bilaga T2 | Hobby income (mining as hobby) | If mining income declared |
| Bilaga NE | Business income (commercial mining) | If mining classified as business |

### 7.2 K4 Avsnitt D Filing Details

- Report **total gain** and **total loss** separately per cryptocurrency type
- Not necessary to report each individual trade — aggregate allowed
- Each cryptocurrency (e.g. Bitcoin, Ethereum) must be reported on a separate line
- E-filing via Skatteverket's e-tjänst automatically calculates totals

### 7.3 Filing Deadlines

| Deadline | Description |
|---|---|
| 2 May 2026 | E-filing deadline for income year 2025 |
| March 2026 | Paper filing deadline (earlier than e-filing) |
| 30 June 2026 | Extended deadline if granted anstånd (extension) |

### 7.4 DAC8 / CARF Reporting (From 2026)

The Swedish Riksdag adopted DAC8/CARF implementation on 26 November 2025:
- Crypto service providers report user transaction data to Skatteverket
- Applies to reporting periods beginning after 31 December 2025
- Does **not** change how crypto is taxed — only enhances information exchange
- Skatteverket will cross-reference reported data with individual declarations

### 7.5 Record-Keeping

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention period | 7 years from end of relevant tax year |
| Records to maintain | Full transaction logs, cost basis calculations, exchange CSVs, wallet addresses, staking/mining logs |
| Format | CSV exports preferred; on-chain records (block explorer links) recommended |
| Burden of proof | On taxpayer — Skatteverket can request full documentation |

---

## Section 8 -- Loss Offset and Carry-Forward

### 8.1 Loss Offset Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Loss within andra tillgångar | 100% offset against gains in same category |
| Net loss from andra tillgångar | 70% deductible against other capital income (e.g. dividends, interest) |
| Net capital deficit (all capital income) | Skattereduktion: 30% of deficit up to SEK 100,000; 21% on excess |
| Carry-forward of capital losses | **NOT permitted** — losses must be used in the year they arise |

### 8.2 Stolen or Lost Crypto

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Crypto stolen (hacked exchange/wallet) | Generally **not** deductible — Skatteverket requires a genuine avyttring (disposal) |
| Exchange bankruptcy (e.g. FTX) | May qualify as avyttring if a court-approved restructuring plan converts holdings to a claim (as in FTX — Skatteverket guidance 2025) |
| Lost private keys | Not deductible — no avyttring has occurred |

---

## Section 9 -- Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 General Anti-Avoidance

Sweden has a general anti-avoidance rule (skatteflyktslagen, 1995:575) that can be invoked to disregard artificial tax-driven arrangements.

### 9.2 Wash Sales

Sweden does **not** have a specific wash-sale rule for crypto. A taxpayer could theoretically sell at a loss and immediately repurchase to harvest the loss. However:
- The new purchase resets the average cost basis (genomsnittsmetoden)
- Skatteverket may challenge if the arrangement lacks business substance under the general anti-avoidance rule

### 9.3 Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) Rules

If crypto is held through a foreign entity in a low-tax jurisdiction, Swedish CFC rules (IL Chapter 39a) may attribute income to the Swedish resident shareholder.

### 9.4 Exit Taxation

Sweden imposes a 10-year trailing tax on capital gains for individuals who emigrate. If an individual was resident in Sweden for at least 10 of the 15 years preceding emigration, capital gains on certain assets (including securities) may still be taxable in Sweden. Crypto's classification as "andra tillgångar" (not securities) means it may not fall within the exit tax scope — **flag for specialist review**.

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Simple Buy and Sell

**Input:** Swedish resident. Bought 0.5 BTC on 15 January 2025 at SEK 500,000 per BTC (total SEK 250,000). Exchange fee SEK 500. Sold 0.5 BTC on 20 October 2025 at SEK 700,000 per BTC (total SEK 350,000). Exchange fee SEK 700.

**Computation:**
```
Acquisition cost:      0.5 × SEK 500,000 + SEK 500 fee = SEK 250,500
Disposal proceeds:     0.5 × SEK 700,000 = SEK 350,000
Disposal costs:        SEK 700
Net proceeds:          SEK 350,000 - SEK 700 = SEK 349,300
Gain:                  SEK 349,300 - SEK 250,500 = SEK 98,800
Tax (30%):             SEK 98,800 × 0.30 = SEK 29,640

Reporting: K4 avsnitt D — Bitcoin — Gain SEK 98,800
```

### Example 2 -- Loss Scenario with 70% Deduction

**Input:** Swedish resident. Bought 10 ETH at average cost of SEK 30,000 each. Sold all 10 ETH at SEK 15,000 each. No other capital income in 2025.

**Computation:**
```
Acquisition cost:      10 × SEK 30,000 = SEK 300,000
Disposal proceeds:     10 × SEK 15,000 = SEK 150,000
Loss:                  SEK 150,000 - SEK 300,000 = SEK -150,000

Deductible loss (70%): SEK 150,000 × 0.70 = SEK 105,000
Capital deficit:       SEK 105,000
Skattereduktion:
  On first SEK 100,000: SEK 100,000 × 30% = SEK 30,000
  On excess SEK 5,000:  SEK 5,000 × 21%   = SEK 1,050
  Total tax credit:     SEK 31,050

Reporting: K4 avsnitt D — Ethereum — Loss SEK 150,000
The SEK 31,050 skattereduktion reduces municipal/state tax owed.
```

### Example 3 -- Mining Hobby Income + Subsequent Sale

**Input:** Swedish resident. Mined 0.2 BTC throughout 2025 (hobby scale). FMV at time of each mining reward totalled SEK 120,000. Later sold 0.2 BTC for SEK 140,000.

**Computation:**
```
Step 1 — Mining income:
  Income of hobby (inkomst av tjänst): SEK 120,000
  Taxed at marginal earned income rates (municipal + possibly state tax)
  Reporting: Bilaga T2

Step 2 — Sale of mined BTC:
  Cost basis: SEK 120,000 (= income declared)
  Proceeds: SEK 140,000
  Gain: SEK 20,000
  Tax (30%): SEK 6,000
  Reporting: K4 avsnitt D
```

## Self-Checks

Before finalising any Sweden crypto computation, verify:

- [ ] All amounts converted to SEK at the exchange rate on the transaction date
- [ ] Genomsnittsmetoden (average cost) used — NOT FIFO or specific identification
- [ ] Average cost calculated separately per cryptocurrency type
- [ ] All exchanges and wallets pooled together for the same cryptocurrency
- [ ] Mining/staking income declared separately from capital gains
- [ ] Staking reported as ränteinkomst (punkt 7.2) at 30%

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER use FIFO or specific identification for crypto cost basis — genomsnittsmetoden is mandatory in Sweden
- NEVER treat crypto-to-crypto swaps as non-taxable events
- NEVER ignore the 70% limitation on capital loss deductions
- NEVER assume losses can be carried forward — they cannot
- NEVER classify all mining as business income — most individuals are classified as hobby
- NEVER treat transfers between own wallets as disposals
- NEVER compute gains without verified cost basis and average cost calculations
- NEVER ignore DeFi lending as a potential disposal event
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
