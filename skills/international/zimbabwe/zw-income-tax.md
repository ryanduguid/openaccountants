description: Use this skill whenever asked about Zimbabwe income tax (PAYE, self-employed trade tax, or provisional tax) for individuals. Trigger on phrases like "how much PAYE do I pay", "ZIMRA tax tables", "USD tax bands", "ZiG / ZWG tax", "AIDS levy", "ITF1", "ITF12C", "ITF12B", "QPD provisional tax", "self-employed tax Zimbabwe", "NSSA contributions", "tax-free threshold Zimbabwe", "elderly credit", or any question about filing or computing income tax for an employee or a self-employed trader in Zimbabwe. Also trigger when classifying a Zimbabwean bank statement (USD or ZiG), computing the 3% AIDS levy, or advising on QPD instalments. This skill covers the dual-currency PAYE tables (USD and ZWG), the flat 25% trade/business rate, the AIDS levy, NSSA, provisional tax (QPDs), filing forms/deadlines, and registration/VAT thresholds. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Zimbabwe income tax work.

### How the dual-currency system works

Zimbabwe taxes income in the currency it is earned. An employee paid in USD is taxed on the **USD PAYE table**; an employee paid in ZiG/ZWG is taxed on the **ZWG PAYE table**. An employee paid in both currencies has each stream taxed under its own table. The **3% AIDS Levy** is then added to the income tax computed (it is a levy ON the tax, not on income). Source: ZIMRA Jan-Dec 2025 PAYE tax tables.

> **ZWG instability note.** The ZiG (introduced April 2024, replacing ZWL) is subject to devaluation, and ZIMRA may revise ZWG bands mid-year by public notice. The USD bands are the more stable reference. Always confirm the current ZWG table against the latest ZIMRA publication before computing in ZiG.

**PAYE Tax Brackets -- USD (Foreign Currency), 2025 -- MONTHLY**  _(ZIMRA USD Jan-Dec 2025 PAYE table (https://www.zimra.co.zw/domestic-taxes/tax-tables?download=4211:usd-jan-dec-2025-tax-tables))_

| Monthly income (USD) | Rate | Deduct (USD) | Cumulative tax at top of band |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 100.00 | 0% | -- | USD 0.00 |

- **Deduct method** — Each bracket taxes only its slice. "Deduct" is the ZIMRA shortcut: tax = (income x rate) - deduct.  _(ZIMRA USD Jan-Dec 2025 PAYE table (https://www.zimra.co.zw/domestic-taxes/tax-tables?download=4211:usd-jan-dec-2025-tax-tables))_
- **Tax-free threshold (USD)** — USD 100/month = USD 1,200/year. Top effective rate including AIDS levy = 40% x 1.03 = 41.2%.  _(ZIMRA USD Jan-Dec 2025 PAYE table)_

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown currency of pay (USD vs ZWG) | STOP -- cannot pick a tax table without the currency of earnings |
| Unknown pay period | Treat as monthly and flag for reviewer |
| Employment vs trade income unclear | Treat as trade income only if clearly a business; otherwise STOP |
| Unknown elderly/disability status | Apply NO credit (claim only on confirmation) |
| Unknown bonus amount vs exemption | Apply exemption only up to confirmed USD 700 ceiling |
| Unknown NSSA insurable earnings | Apply ceiling of USD 700 (or ZWG equivalent) |
| Unknown whether expense is wholly for trade | Not deductible |
| Mixed-use expense, no apportionment basis | 0% deduction |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

- **Minimum viable inputs** — the currency the client is paid in (USD and/or ZWG), the pay period, gross earnings, and whether the person is a pure employee (PAYE/FDS) or carries on a trade/profession. For traders: a bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text).
- **Recommended inputs** — payslips or employer PAYE schedules, bonus details, age (for the 55+ credit), disability status, NSSA contribution records, prior-year ITF1/ITF12C or assessment, VAT registration status, QPD payment confirmations.
- **Ideal inputs** — complete income and expenditure account, invoices/receipts supporting every deduction, asset register, provisional tax (QPD) payment proofs, employment income details if combined with trade income.
- **Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN** — No currency-of-pay = hard stop (cannot select a table). For traders, no bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions are supported by valid documentation and meet the wholly-and-exclusively test under the Income Tax Act."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-ZW-1** — Currency of earnings unknown. "Zimbabwe operates separate USD and ZWG PAYE tables. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the currency (or currencies) in which the client is paid. Please confirm before proceeding."
- **R-ZW-2** — Companies, partnerships, trusts. "This skill covers individuals (employees and sole traders/professionals) only. Companies, partnerships, and trusts file separately. Escalate to a registered tax practitioner."
- **R-ZW-3** — Non-resident / source-and-residence complexity. "Non-resident taxation, withholding taxes on non-residents, and double-tax-treaty relief require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a registered tax practitioner."
- **R-ZW-4** — Capital gains / property disposals. "Capital gains tax on specified assets and immovable property is a separate regime. Out of scope. Escalate to a registered tax practitioner."
- **R-ZW-5** — Presumptive tax / informal sector full schedule. "Presumptive tax categories and exact USD amounts are revised in the annual Finance Act and ZIMRA public notices. This skill carries only headline figures. Confirm the full schedule against the current ZIMRA presumptive-tax public notice. Escalate if precise per-category amounts are needed."
- **R-ZW-6** — Arrears / enforcement / penalties. "Client has outstanding arrears or is subject to ZIMRA enforcement. Late-filing penalties can reach 100% of tax due, plus interest at the prescribed rate. Do not advise. Escalate to a registered tax practitioner immediately."
- **R-ZW-7** — VAT return requested. "This skill covers income tax / PAYE only. Zimbabwe VAT (including fiscalisation under Public Notice 30 of 2025) is out of scope here."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank-statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Statements may be in USD or ZiG/ZWG -- read the currency column. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or narration as it appears on the statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. Many Zimbabwean statements mix English and Shona/Ndebele terms -- see Section 8.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits)

**3.1 Income Patterns (Credits)**

### 3.6 Zimbabwean Banks -- Statement Format Reference

**3.6 Zimbabwean Banks -- Statement Format Reference**

| Bank | Common Patterns | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CBZ Bank | TRANSFER, RTGS, ZIPIT, CHARGES | PDF/CSV; USD and ZWG accounts separate |
| Stanbic Bank | PAYMENT, TRF, FEE | PDF; merchant in narration |
| Steward Bank | ECOCASH, TRANSFER, CHARGE | Mobile-linked; many EcoCash entries |
| FBC Bank | RTGS, ZIPIT, DEBIT | PDF/CSV |
| Nedbank Zimbabwe | PAYMENT, TRANSFER, FEE | PDF |
| EcoCash (mobile money) | CASH IN/OUT, MERCHANT PAY, P2P | Statement export; high transaction volume |

- **Currency hygiene** — Never mix USD and ZWG figures in one computation. Each currency runs through its own PAYE table and is reported separately.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- USD Employee, mid-range salary

**Input line:**
`25/03/2025 ; CBZ CREDIT ; ACME ENGINEERING LTD ; SALARY MARCH ; +1,500.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
USD-paid employee, monthly. USD monthly table, band 1,000.01-2,000 at 30%, deduct 85.
Income tax = (1,500 x 30%) - 85 = 450 - 85 = **USD 365.00**.
AIDS levy = 365.00 x 3% = USD 10.95.
Total tax = 365.00 + 10.95 = **USD 375.95**.

**Classification:** PAYE (USD table). Net pay before NSSA = 1,500 - 375.95 = USD 1,124.05.

### Example 2 -- USD Employee, higher salary

**Input line:**
`25/04/2025 ; STANBIC ; HORIZON MINING ; SALARY APRIL ; +2,500.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
USD monthly table, band 2,000.01-3,000 at 35%, deduct 185.
Income tax = (2,500 x 35%) - 185 = 875 - 185 = **USD 690.00**.
AIDS levy = 690.00 x 3% = USD 20.70.
Total tax = **USD 710.70**.

**Classification:** PAYE (USD table). Total tax USD 710.70.

### Example 3 -- ZiG/ZWG Employee

**Input line:**
`25/05/2025 ; FBC ; SADZA RETAIL (PVT) LTD ; MUHOLO MAY ; +50,000.00 ; ZWG`

**Reasoning:**
ZWG-paid employee, monthly. ZWG monthly table, band 28,000.01-56,000 at 30%, deduct 2,380.
Income tax = (50,000 x 30%) - 2,380 = 15,000 - 2,380 = **ZWG 12,620.00**.
AIDS levy = 12,620.00 x 3% = ZWG 378.60.
Total tax = **ZWG 12,998.60**.

**Classification:** PAYE (ZWG table). Total tax ZWG 12,998.60. Do NOT convert to USD -- report in ZWG.

### Example 4 -- USD Employee below threshold

**Input line:**
`25/06/2025 ; STEWARD ; SMALL SHOP ; SALARY JUNE ; +90.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
USD 90/month is below the USD 100 tax-free threshold (band 0-100, 0%).
Income tax = USD 0.00. AIDS levy on zero = USD 0.00.

**Classification:** PAYE (USD table). No tax. Full USD 90.00 retained (before NSSA).

### Example 5 -- Self-employed trader (flat 25%)

**Input (annual summary, USD):**
Gross trade income USD 40,000; allowable expenses USD 16,000.

**Reasoning:**
Individuals from trade and investment are taxed at the **flat 25% business rate** (Finance Act s.14(2b)), NOT the progressive PAYE table.
Taxable income = 40,000 - 16,000 = USD 24,000.
Income tax = 24,000 x 25% = **USD 6,000.00**.
AIDS levy = 6,000 x 3% = USD 180.00.
Total tax = **USD 6,180.00** (effective 25.75%).

**Classification:** ITF12C self-assessment; QPDs payable during the year (Section 5.5).

### Example 6 -- NSSA contribution on USD salary above ceiling

**Input line:**
`30/06/2025 ; CBZ DEBIT ; NSSA P35 ; PENSION JUNE ; -31.50 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Employee earns USD 1,000/month, but NSSA insurable earnings are capped at **USD 700/month**.
Total POBS contribution = 9% x 700 = USD 63.00, split equally.
Employee share = 4.5% x 700 = **USD 31.50**; employer share = USD 31.50.

**Classification:** NSSA POBS employee contribution USD 31.50. The USD 1,000 salary is still taxed under the USD PAYE table.

### Example 7 -- Bonus within exemption

**Input line:**
`20/12/2025 ; STANBIC ; ACME ENGINEERING LTD ; ANNUAL BONUS ; +700.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Tax-free bonus / performance-award exemption is USD 700 (ZIMRA PAYE page).
USD 700 bonus = fully within the exemption.
Taxable portion = USD 0.00. Any bonus ABOVE USD 700 is added to taxable earnings and taxed at the marginal PAYE rate.

**Classification:** Exempt up to USD 700. Flag any excess for inclusion.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Selecting the correct PAYE table

- **Selecting the correct PAYE table** — Use the table matching the currency of pay and the pay period (monthly/annual/fortnightly/weekly/daily). USD earnings → USD table; ZWG earnings → ZWG table. Mixed-currency earners have each stream taxed under its own table. Never convert one currency to the other to "combine" income.  _(Income Tax Act [Chapter 23:06]; ZIMRA 2025 PAYE tables)_

### 5.2 The "deduct" method

- **The deduct method** — tax = (taxable income x band rate) - deduct. This reproduces the cumulative progressive result without manual slicing. Always confirm the income falls in the stated band first.

### 5.3 AIDS Levy

- **AIDS Levy computation** — After computing income tax, add 3% of the income tax payable (not 3% of income). Applies to individuals and companies. If income tax is zero (below threshold), the AIDS levy is also zero.  _(ZIMRA 2025 PAYE tables; ZIMRA corporate tax rates)_

### 5.4 Bonus / performance-award exemption

- **Bonus exemption** — The first USD 700 (ZWG equivalent for ZiG earners) of an annual bonus / performance award is exempt. Only the excess is added to taxable earnings.  _(ZIMRA PAYE page)_

### 5.5 Trade and investment income (self-employed individuals)

- **Trade and investment income taxation** — Individuals carrying on a trade or profession are taxed at a flat 25% on net taxable income (gross business income minus allowable expenses), plus 3% AIDS levy → 25.75% effective. This is NOT the progressive PAYE table -- that table is for employment income only. Companies and trusts are taxed at the same 25% + 3% AIDS = 25.75% effective.  _(ZIMRA corporate/business tax rates (Finance Act s.14(2b)))_

### 5.6 Self-employed professionals -- moved to QPD from 1 Jan 2025

- **Self-employed professionals moved to QPD** — Effective 1 January 2025, self-employed professionals (architects, engineers, legal practitioners, health practitioners, real-estate agents, etc.) were removed from presumptive tax and placed on the Self-Assessment / QPD provisional-tax system. They file provisional returns (ITF12B) and pay QPDs on estimated taxable income at the 25% + AIDS-levy business rate. Non-professional informal traders may still fall under presumptive tax (Section 5.8).  _(Lucent (lucent.co.zw QPD guide); transition confirmed via multiple secondary sources)_

### 5.7 Provisional tax (QPDs)

**5.7 Provisional tax (QPDs)**  _(Lucent QPD guide; ZIMRA Public Notice 17 of 2025)_

| QPD | % of estimated annual tax | Return (ITF12B) due | Payment due |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st (Q1) | 10% | 20 March | 25 March |
| 2nd (Q2) | 25% | 20 June | 25 June |
| 3rd (Q3) | 30% | 20 September | 25 September |
| 4th (Q4) | 35% | 15 December | 20 December |

- **QPD totals** — The four instalments sum to 100% of the estimated annual tax (10 + 25 + 30 + 35). The return is submitted ~5 days before each payment date.  _(Lucent QPD guide; ZIMRA Public Notice 17 of 2025)_

### 5.8 Presumptive tax (informal sector -- non-professionals)

- **Presumptive tax details** — Targets informal businesses with turnover generally below USD 60,000/year. Examples cited: restaurant/bottle-store operators USD 300/quarter; cottage-industry operators USD 300/quarter. Cross-border traders: presumptive tax = 10% of the Value for Duty Purposes (VDP) of commercial goods imported. A 2026 budget proposal referenced a 5%-of-turnover "other trades" rate -- not confirmed as enacted for 2025 `[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]`.  _(ZIMRA presumptive-tax notices; figures from research summaries -- `[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the full current schedule against the latest ZIMRA presumptive-tax public notice]`)_

### 5.9 The wholly-and-exclusively test (deductions)

- **Wholly-and-exclusively test** — For traders, an expense is deductible only if incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis. Personal expenses, drawings, fines, and the tax itself are never deductible.  _(Income Tax Act [Chapter 23:06])_

### 5.10 Final Deduction System (FDS)

- **Final Deduction System (FDS)** — For pure-employment individuals, PAYE is generally a final tax -- most employees do NOT file an annual return. Individuals with non-employment income (trade, multiple employers, investment income) must file the relevant return (ITF1 / ITF12C).  _(PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Zimbabwe individual))_

### 6.1 NSSA -- Pension and Other Benefits Scheme (POBS)

**6.1 NSSA -- Pension and Other Benefits Scheme (POBS)**  _(NSSA contributions/schemes pages; M&J Consultants 2025 NSSA summary)_

| Component | Rate | On |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee | 4.5% | Insurable earnings (capped) |
| Employer | 4.5% | Insurable earnings (capped) |
| **Total POBS** | **9.0%** | Insurable earnings (capped) |

- **POBS totals and ceiling** — The employee and employer columns (4.5% + 4.5%) sum to the 9.0% total. Insurable earnings ceiling: USD 700/month (introduced 2024, in force 2025). Contributions are computed only on earnings up to USD 700. ZWG-paid employees contribute on the ZWG equivalent of USD 700. Worked check: an employee earning USD 1,000 contributes on USD 700 → 9% = USD 63/month total (USD 31.50 each). (See Example 6.) Minimum / floor: `[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]` No explicit statutory minimum floor was confirmed from authoritative sources; verify directly with NSSA if a floor figure is needed.  _(NSSA contributions/schemes pages; M&J Consultants 2025 NSSA summary)_

### 6.2 NSSA -- Accident Prevention and Workers' Compensation Scheme (APWCS)

- **APWCS details** — Employer-only contribution (employees pay nothing). Rate varies by industry risk class -- no single statutory rate. Low-risk sectors (retail, finance, education) roughly 0.5-1% of the wage bill; high-risk (mining, construction) materially higher. `[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]` Exact per-industry class rates must be obtained from NSSA for the specific industry. Do not publish a single APWCS percentage.  _(NSSA schemes page; secondary summaries)_

### 6.3 Home-based business apportionment

- **Home-based business apportionment** — Apportion electricity (ZESA/ZETDC), water, internet, and rent to the business-use percentage. Conservative default: 0% until the reviewer confirms a documented basis (dedicated workspace, floor-area or usage measure).

### 6.4 Vehicle business use

- **Vehicle business use** — Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and maintenance is deductible; requires a mileage basis. Conservative default: 0% until a mileage log is provided.

### 6.5 Phone / data mixed use

- **Phone / data mixed use** — Business-use portion only (Econet/NetOne/TelOne/Liquid). Conservative default: 0% until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.6 IMTT (Intermediated Money Transfer Tax) deductibility

- **IMTT deductibility** — IMTT is levied on electronic transfers. Whether it is deductible against trade income depends on the nature of the transfer. Flag for reviewer to confirm deductibility before including.

### 6.7 Elderly / disability credits

- **Elderly / disability credits** — Age-55+ credit and blind/disabled credit are USD 900/year each (or ZWG equivalent) (ZIMRA concessions). Flag for reviewer to confirm eligibility (age, certified disability) before applying. Default: no credit.  _(ZIMRA concessions)_

### 6.8 ZWG band revisions

- **ZWG band revisions** — ZWG bands may be revised mid-year by ZIMRA public notice owing to devaluation. Flag for reviewer to confirm the ZWG table in force for the period being computed.

- NEVER compute NSSA on earnings above the USD 700 monthly insurable ceiling
- NEVER apply elderly or disability credits without confirming eligibility
- NEVER treat QPD provisional tax or income tax paid as a deductible expense
