# Russia — Business Formation & Registration for Self-Employed People

This skill helps an AI agent guide a user through *legally setting up* to earn
business income in Russia: registering as **самозанятый** (НПД), registering as
an **ИП** (*индивидуальный предприниматель* — individual entrepreneur / sole
proprietor), and understanding when forming an **ООО** (*общество с
ограниченной ответственностью* — limited liability company) is worth it. It
covers the registration mechanics, the state duty (*госпошлина*), choosing
**ОКВЭД** activity codes, electing a tax regime, opening a business bank account
(*расчётный счёт*), and deregistering / closing.

The AI replies to the user in the user's own language. Russian legal and tax
terms are kept native (самозанятый, ИП, ООО, ОКВЭД, ФНС, Госуслуги, ЕГРИП,
ЕГРЮЛ, расчётный счёт, госпошлина) so the meaning maps cleanly to the official
wording the user will see on the forms.

This skill stops at *formation*. Once the entity exists, route to the operating
skills: **ru-self-employed-npd** (НПД mechanics), **ru-usn** (simplified
system), **ru-income-tax**, **ru-social-contributions** (страховые взносы), and
**russia-vat** where relevant.

### Conservative defaults

When the user's facts are incomplete, the agent applies the safest reading and
flags the assumption rather than guessing optimistically:

- **Default to the simplest legal form that fits.** If a person is a solo
  freelancer with no employees, no goods resale, and income comfortably under
  2.4 млн ₽/year, default to **самозанятый (НПД)** — it is free, instant, and
  carries no страховые взносы and no reporting. Only escalate to ИП or ООО when
  the user's facts genuinely require it.
- **Never let the УСН election lapse silently.** If a new ИП wants УСН, the
  уведомление о переходе на УСН must be filed **with the registration documents
  or within 30 calendar days** of registration. Missing it drops the ИП onto
  **ОСНО** (the general regime, with VAT and НДФЛ) until the next calendar year.
  Always surface this deadline prominently.
- **Treat all rates, limits, and duties as point-in-time.** Russian tax law
  changes frequently (the 2026 reform notably cut the УСН/ПСН VAT-exemption and
  ПСН income limits). Where a figure drives a decision, the agent says "verify
  current value/procedure on nalog.gov.ru before relying on it".
- **Verify ОКВЭД codes against the official ОКВЭД 2 classifier** rather than
  inventing codes; the wrong code can block a regime (e.g. ПСН) or trigger
  questions.
- **Distinguish "can earn income" from "must register".** Casual one-off income
  may be reportable as an ordinary individual (НДФЛ via 3-НДФЛ); systematic
  business activity requires самозанятый / ИП / ООО status. When in doubt, flag
  it and recommend a Russian accountant.
- **No legal/registry actions are taken for the user.** The agent explains; the
  user files.

---

## 2. Becoming самозанятый (НПД) — instant registration via «Мой налог»

The **самозанятый** status (the Professional Income Tax / *Налог на
профессиональный доход* / **НПД**) is the lightest possible way to legalise
freelance income in Russia. There is **no state duty**, **no entry in any
business register**, and **no separate filing** — registration is effectively
instant.

**Who can become самозанятый**
- A Russian (or eligible EAEU) individual, **or an existing ИП** who switches to
  НПД.
- No employees (the самозанятый may not hire staff under labour contracts).
- Annual income **≤ 2,400,000 ₽** per calendar year.
- Activity is permitted for НПД — i.e. **own services, work, or self-made
  goods**. *Excluded*: resale of others' goods, подакцизные / маркированные
  goods, mining/extraction, agency/commission work, etc. (see
  ru-self-employed-npd for the full exclusion list).

**How to register (any one of these)**
1. **«Мой налог» app** (lknpd.nalog.ru or mobile) — register by passport photo
   + selfie, or via the ФНС личный кабинет, or via Госуслуги. This is the
   primary route.
2. **Госуслуги** (gosuslugi.ru) — links through to НПД registration.
3. **A partner bank** (Сбербанк, Т-Банк, Альфа-Банк, etc.) — many offer
   in-app самозанятый registration tied to an existing card/account.

**What happens at registration**
- ФНС confirms the status (usually same day; it can refuse within ~6 days if
  data mismatches).
- The person is **not** added to ЕГРИП or ЕГРЮЛ — they remain a физлицо with an
  НПД flag. Status can be checked on the public ФНС service
  (npd.nalog.ru → "Проверить статус самозанятого").
- No расчётный счёт is required — a самозанятый may receive money to an ordinary
  personal card and issues a **чек** through «Мой налог».

**Key facts to relay** (verify current values on nalog.gov.ru):
- Tax: **4%** on income from individuals, **6%** from legal entities / ИП.
- **No страховые взносы** are mandatory (pension contributions are voluntary).
- The regime is a federal experiment scheduled through **31.12.2028** — confirm
  it has not been changed before advising on a long horizon.

> payment, and what to do when the 2.4 млн ₽ cap is hit.

## 3. Registering as ИП (individual entrepreneur) — step by step

An **ИП** is the right form when the user outgrows НПД (over 2.4 млн ₽, needs
employees, resells goods, or wants ПСН / УСН with expense deductions) but a
full company is overkill. An ИП is **not a separate legal person** — the
individual remains personally liable for business debts with their own property,
but enjoys far simpler accounting and reporting than an ООО.

### 3.1 Step-by-step

1. **Choose ОКВЭД codes.** Pick one **main** activity code and any number of
   **additional** codes from the official **ОКВЭД 2** classifier. Use the
   narrowest codes that genuinely describe the work; codes can be added/changed
   later via form Р24001. Some regimes (especially ПСН) depend on the activity.
2. **Choose the tax regime** (see decision table in §3.3) and prepare the
   election (e.g. the УСН уведомление) so it can be filed *with* registration.
3. **Prepare form Р21001** (the ИП application) — name, ИНН, passport data,
   ОКВЭД codes. The applicant needs an **ИНН**; if they don't have one, it is
   assigned during registration.
4. **Choose a filing channel** (see §3.2) and pay the **800 ₽ госпошлина**
   *only if filing on paper*. Electronic filing is free.
5. **Submit to ФНС.** Registration is completed within **3 working days** of a
   complete filing.
6. **Receive the result.** ФНС issues the **Лист записи ЕГРИП** (record sheet)
   electronically — the ИП is now entered in **ЕГРИП**. There is no longer a
   paper certificate (свидетельство).
7. **Open a расчётный счёт** if needed (see §3.4) and start operating.

### 3.2 Where / how to file (channels)

| Channel | State duty | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Госуслуги** (gosuslugi.ru) | **0 ₽** | Electronic; needs a confirmed account / e-signature flow |
| **ФНС online** ("Государственная регистрация ИП", service.nalog.ru) | **0 ₽** electronically | Free if signed with an e-signature / via the app; 800 ₽ if it falls back to paper |
| **Bank** (Сбербанк, Т-Банк, Альфа, ВТБ, etc.) | **0 ₽** | Bank prepares docs + free e-signature and files for you; usually bundled with opening a расчётный счёт |
| **МФЦ** ("Мои документы") | **0 ₽** (if MFC files electronically) | Confirm the specific MFC transmits documents electronically |
| **Notary** | **0 ₽** for duty (notary fee applies) | Notary signs and transmits electronically |
| **Paper to ФНС / by mail** | **800 ₽** | Pay the duty and attach the receipt |

> The cheapest route is almost always **electronic** (Госуслуги / ФНС / bank):
> **0 ₽ state duty**.

### 3.3 Choosing the tax regime at (or after) registration

This is the single most consequential choice. **The УСН election must be filed
with the registration documents or within 30 calendar days of registration**;
otherwise the ИП sits on ОСНО until the next calendar year. ПСН requires a
separate patent application (form 26.5-1) before the patent start date.

| Regime | Best for | Headline rate (2026 — verify) | Income limit (verify) | Reporting | Election deadline |
|--------|----------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **НПД** (самозанятый) | Solo, services / own goods, no staff, < 2.4 млн ₽ | 4% (individuals) / 6% (legal entities) | **2,400,000 ₽**/yr | None (auto via «Мой налог») | Register in «Мой налог» any time; an ИП may switch to НПД |
| **УСН «Доходы»** | Low-expense services, wants simplicity | **6%** of revenue (regions may cut to 1%) | High annual cap — **verify current value** | Annual declaration | With registration **or within 30 days** |
| **УСН «Доходы минус расходы»** | Real, documented costs | **15%** of profit (regions may cut to 5%) | Same УСН cap — **verify** | Annual declaration | With registration **or within 30 days** |
| **ПСН** (patent) | Specific eligible activities, predictable income | Cost of the patent (fixed, region/activity-based) | **20,000,000 ₽**/yr from 2026 (cut from 60 млн — verify) | Patent ledger (КУДиР для ПСН), no declaration | Patent application ≥ 10 working days before start |
| **ОСНО** (general) | Needs VAT, big clients, or fell out of other regimes | НДФЛ on profit + НДС (VAT) | None | Full — НДФЛ + НДС | Default if nothing else elected |

Notes for the agent (all **verify current value/procedure**):
- **2026 reform context:** the VAT-exemption threshold for УСН was reduced (the
  exemption limit dropped to roughly **20 млн ₽** of revenue for 2026, with
  further reductions planned for later years), and the **ПСН income limit fell
  to 20 млн ₽**. This makes "which regime" advice time-sensitive — flag it.
- **ИП on any regime except НПД pays fixed страховые взносы** for themselves
  (see ru-social-contributions). НПД carries no mandatory contributions.
- УСН and ПСН can be **combined** by one ИП (e.g. patent for one activity, УСН
  for the rest). Confirm the combination rules currently in force.
- **АУСН** (automated УСН) is an additional special regime in some regions — out
  of scope here; mention it exists and defer to a current source.

### 3.4 Opening a расчётный счёт (business bank account)

- An ИП is **not legally required** to open a расчётный счёт, but in practice
  needs one to accept card/online payments, work with companies, pay taxes
  conveniently, and use acquiring. (A самозанятый generally does **not** need
  one — a personal card suffices.)
- Opened at any Russian bank (Т-Банк, Сбербанк, Альфа, Точка, ВТБ, etc.),
  usually online: provide ИП registration data (ЕГРИП record), passport, ИНН.
- The bank notifies ФНС of the account automatically.
- Mixing personal and business money on one account is discouraged; a dedicated
  расчётный счёт keeps accounting clean and is expected by counterparties.

## 4. ИП vs ООО — comparison

| Dimension | ИП (individual entrepreneur) | ООО (limited liability company) |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Legal nature | The individual themselves (физлицо со статусом ИП) | A separate legal person (юрлицо) |
| Register | **ЕГРИП** | **ЕГРЮЛ** |
| Liability | **Personal** — answers for business debts with own property | Limited to the company's assets / charter capital (with exceptions for subsidiary liability) |
| Charter capital | None | Minimum **10,000 ₽** (paid in money within 4 months of registration) |
| State duty (госпошлина) | 800 ₽ paper / **0 ₽** electronic | 4,000 ₽ paper / **0 ₽** electronic |
| Registration form | Р21001 | Р11001 + charter + founder's decision |
| Owners | One individual only | 1–50 participants (участники) |
| Profit withdrawal | Free — business money is the owner's money | Via salary or **dividends** (taxed; distribution rules apply) |
| Accounting | Simplified (no full бухучёт on most regimes) | Full accounting + balance sheet required |
| Tax regimes | НПД*, УСН, ПСН, ОСНО, АУСН | УСН, ОСНО, АУСН (no НПД, no ПСН) |
| Страховые взносы | Fixed "for self" (except on НПД) | For employees / director (min base ~1 МРОТ from 2026 — verify) |
| Closing | Simple — form Р26001, fast, cheap | Liquidation procedure — months, multi-step |

\*НПД is available to an individual who is also registered as ИП, with НПД's
own limits.

**When an ООО makes sense:**
- More than one owner / investors, or you need to bring in partners with shares.
- You want **limited liability** to ring-fence personal assets from business
  risk.
- Activities that are **closed to ИП** (e.g. selling strong alcohol at retail,
  certain licensed/regulated businesses, banking, insurance).
- Larger operations, employees, outside financing, or a plan to sell the
  business as a transferable asset.

For a solo freelance developer or service provider, **ИП (or самозанятый)** is
almost always the right call; an ООО adds cost, bookkeeping, and exit friction
for little benefit.

## 5. Worked examples (personas)

### Example A — Solo freelance developer, ~1.5 млн ₽/year
Anna writes code for individuals and small Russian companies, no employees,
income about 1.5 млн ₽/year. **Recommendation:** register as **самозанятый
(НПД)** via «Мой налог» — free, instant, no register entry, no страховые
взносы, no reporting. Tax: 4% from individuals, 6% from companies. Revisit only
if she approaches the **2.4 млн ₽** cap or wants to hire.

### Example B — Developer growing past 2.4 млн ₽, wants to hire one helper
Boris earns ~4 млн ₽/year and wants to bring on a contractor and work with
larger clients who expect a расчётный счёт. НПД no longer fits (over cap,
employees). **Recommendation:** register as **ИП**, file the **УСН «Доходы»**
уведомление **with the application or within 30 days** (so he isn't stranded on
ОСНО), pick narrow ОКВЭД codes for software development, file electronically
(**0 ₽** duty), and open a расчётный счёт. Note he will owe fixed страховые
взносы (see ru-social-contributions).

### Example C — Service business with heavy real costs
Galina runs a small studio with substantial documented expenses (subcontractors,
equipment, rent). **Recommendation:** **ИП on УСН «Доходы минус расходы» (15%)**,
because deductible costs make profit-based tax cheaper than 6% of gross. File
the УСН election on time; keep expense documents (КУДиР). Compare against ПСН if
her specific activity is patent-eligible and within the **20 млн ₽** ПСН limit.

### Example D — Two co-founders launching a product company
Dmitry and a partner want to split ownership, take outside investment later, and
limit personal liability. **Recommendation:** form an **ООО** with **10,000 ₽**
charter capital, file Р11001 + charter electronically (**0 ₽** duty), elect УСН
within 30 days if eligible, and open a расчётный счёт. Accept the trade-off of
full accounting and a longer closing process in exchange for limited liability
and transferable shares.

---

## 6. Tier 2 notes, references, and checklist

### Tier 2 — escalate to a Russian accountant / lawyer when:
- The activity may be **licensed or regulated** (alcohol, finance, medicine,
  education, transport) — formation form and permissions matter.
- The user is a **foreign national / non-resident**, or registering from abroad
  — eligibility, ИНН, and e-signature mechanics differ.
- Choosing between **ИП and ООО** with investors, multiple owners, or asset
  protection at stake.
- The user is near a **regime threshold** (НПД 2.4 млн; ПСН 20 млн; УСН VAT
  exemption ~20 млн) where the 2026 reform changes the math.
- **Combining regimes** (УСН + ПСН) or planning a **mid-year switch**.
- Any **debt, dispute, or tax arrears** present at closing.

### Reference — key forms & registers
- **Р21001** — application to register an ИП.
- **Р24001** — change ИП data (e.g. add/remove ОКВЭД).
- **Р26001** — application to close (deregister) an ИП.
- **Р11001** — application to register an ООО.
- **26.2-1** (КНД 1150001) — уведомление о переходе на УСН.
- **26.5-1** — application for a patent (ПСН).
- **ЕГРИП** — unified state register of individual entrepreneurs.
- **ЕГРЮЛ** — unified state register of legal entities.
- **ОКВЭД 2** — activity classifier for picking codes.
- Services: nalog.gov.ru (ФНС), gosuslugi.ru (Госуслуги), npd.nalog.ru &
  lknpd.nalog.ru («Мой налог» / самозанятый).

### Deregistering / closing

**Close a самозанятый (НПД):** in «Мой налог» → Профиль → "Сняться с учёта НПД",
choose a reason, submit. Free, immediate; status can be re-registered later.
There is nothing to remove from ЕГРИП (a самозанятый was never in it). Settle any
outstanding НПД tax first.

**Close an ИП:** file form **Р26001** to ФНС. State duty is **160 ₽ on paper**,
**0 ₽ electronically** (verify current amount). Before/around closing: settle
страховые взносы, file final declarations, pay outstanding tax, and (if any)
dismiss employees and deregister as an employer. ФНС removes the ИП from **ЕГРИП**
within ~5 working days. (Closing an **ООО** is a multi-month liquidation — out of
scope here; escalate.)

### Formation checklist (ИП)
- [ ] Confirm НПД isn't simpler/sufficient first.
- [ ] Pick main + additional **ОКВЭД 2** codes (narrow, accurate).
- [ ] Decide the tax regime; prepare the **УСН уведомление** if applicable.
- [ ] Prepare **Р21001**; have ИНН + passport ready.
- [ ] File **electronically** (Госуслуги / ФНС / bank) → **0 ₽ duty**.
- [ ] Receive **Лист записи ЕГРИП** (within 3 working days).
- [ ] File УСН election **within 30 days** if not filed with the application.
- [ ] Open a **расчётный счёт** if needed.
- [ ] Note ongoing duties: fixed **страховые взносы**, regime reporting.

## PROHIBITIONS

The agent must **not**:
- File, sign, or submit any registration, election, or closing document on the
  user's behalf, or transmit data to ФНС / Госуслуги / a bank for them. The
  agent explains; the user acts.
- Choose a tax regime as a final decision without flagging that rates, limits,
  and the 2026 reform changes must be **verified on nalog.gov.ru** and confirmed
  with a qualified Russian accountant.
- Invent or guess **ОКВЭД** codes, ИНН/ОГРНИП numbers, form field values, fees,
  or deadlines — verify against the official classifier and current ФНС sources.
- Advise on **licensed / regulated** activities, foreign-national registration,
  multi-owner structuring, or anything with debts/disputes without escalating to
  a qualified professional.
- Present this skill's figures (2.4 млн ₽ cap, 800 ₽ / 4,000 ₽ / 160 ₽ duties,
  10,000 ₽ charter capital, 20 млн ₽ ПСН / VAT limits, 30-day window, 3-day
  registration) as guaranteed-current — they are point-in-time and must be
  re-checked before reliance.
- Provide legal opinions on liability, asset protection, or dispute exposure —
  defer to a lawyer.
