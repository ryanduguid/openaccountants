# Russia — Legal Tax Optimization for the Self-Employed (ИП and Самозанятые)

This skill helps a self-employed person in Russia **legally** pay the least tax by choosing
and combining the right regime. It is a *planning* skill: it ranks the regimes, gives the
break-even points between them, and flags the schemes ФНС treats as abuse. It does **not**
compute a final return — for that, route to the regime skill itself.

The core levers are: (1) the **regime choice** — НПД vs УСН-6% vs УСН-15% vs ПСН vs ОСНО;
(2) the **страховые взносы offset** that wipes out most small-ИП tax; (3) **regional reduced
УСН rates**; and (4) **staying under the 2026 VAT threshold** so a УСН payer keeps a VAT-free
turnover.

### Conservative defaults

When data is missing, assume the **higher-tax, lower-risk** position and say so:

- **Default to the simplest compliant regime** that fits the facts. For a solo freelancer
  under ~2.4M ₽/year with no employees and no resale of goods, default to **НПД**.
- **Never assume a relationship is non-employment.** If a "самозанятый" works mainly for one
  client on that client's schedule and tools, treat it as a **misclassification risk**, not a
  saving.
- **Do not assume a low-rate region applies.** Regional reduced rates require real substance
  and now a qualifying ОКВЭД; default to the **standard 6%/15%** unless eligibility is proven.
- **Assume the 20M ₽ VAT threshold binds** if 2025 turnover is unknown and near the limit.
- **Round tax up, savings down.** Flag every estimate as *verify* and requiring sign-off.

## 2. Choosing the Regime

The five regimes available to a self-employed person, cheapest-first by typical effective burden:

| Regime (native) | What it taxes | Rate(s) (2026) | Turnover ceiling | Employees | страховые взносы? | Best when… |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **НПД / самозанятый** (*налог на профессиональный доход*) | gross receipts | **4%** from individuals, **6%** from legal entities/ИП | **2.4M ₽/yr** | **none allowed** | **none** (voluntary only) | low turnover, services only, no staff, no resale of goods |
| **ИП на УСН «Доходы»** | gross receipts | **6%** (region may cut to **1%**) | up to ~490.5M ₽ (loses VAT-free status above 20M ₽) | allowed | **yes** (offsets tax) | high margin / few real expenses |
| **ИП на УСН «Доходы минус расходы»** | profit (income − documented costs) | **15%** (region may cut to **5%**); **minimum tax 1% of income** | same as above | allowed | yes (counted in expenses) | low margin / heavy documented costs |
| **ИП на ПСН** (*патент*) | fixed *потенциальный доход* set by region | patent price ≈ **6%** of potential income | **20M ₽/yr** (2026; falls to 15M in 2027, 10M from 2028) | limited (≤15) | yes (patent reducible by взносы) | eligible activity with predictable income in a cheap-patent region |
| **ИП на ОСНО** (*общая система*) | profit (НДФЛ) + VAT | **НДФЛ 13–22%** progressive + **НДС 22%** | none | allowed | yes | forced by limits, or when big VAT-paying clients need input VAT |

> **2026 watch-outs.** ПСН lost several activities (private security, watchmen, street patrol,
> caretakers — ФЗ 359-ФЗ). ПСН and the УСН VAT-exemption both now sit on a **20M ₽** ceiling,
> falling further in 2027–2028. *Verify the patent price and eligible ОКВЭД in the specific
> region — patent cost is set locally and varies enormously.*

### Break-even logic

**(a) НПД vs УСН-6%.** Headline НПД rates (4%/6%) look similar to УСН-6%, but НПД carries
**no страховые взносы** (~57k ₽/yr fixed + 1% over 300k on УСН). For a solo freelancer the
взносы swing the comparison decisively toward НПД — until you hit the **2.4M ₽** wall, lose
the no-staff/no-resale conditions, or need pension contributions. At low turnover НПД almost
always wins; above ~2.4M ₽ you *must* leave НПД and УСН/ПСН is the next step.

**(b) УСН-6% vs УСН-15%.** Compare the tax base, not the rate. Switch from «Доходы» (6%) to
«Доходы минус расходы» (15%) when **documented expenses exceed ~60% of income**:

> 6% × Income = 15% × (Income − Expenses) ⟹ break-even at **Expenses ≈ 60% of Income**.

Below ~60% expenses, 6% is cheaper; above it, 15% wins. Adjust the break-even down if your
region offers a reduced «Доходы» rate (1%), and remember the **15% object has a 1%-of-income
minimum tax** in loss/low-profit years. Crucially, on **«Доходы» the страховые взносы reduce
the tax directly** (often to zero for a solo ИП), whereas on «Доходы минус расходы» they are
merely a deductible expense — so the real break-even is usually a bit **above** 60%.

**(c) ПСН vs УСН.** ПСН taxes a *fixed regional potential income*, so it wins when your **real
income exceeds the regional potential income** for that activity and the patent is cheap.
Compute the patent price (region-specific) and compare to УСН-6%/15% on actual numbers. ПСН
also lets you reduce the patent by страховые взносы. Below 20M ₽ only; check eligibility.

**(d) When ОСНО makes sense.** Almost never by choice for a small freelancer — НДФЛ up to 22%
plus 22% НДС is the heaviest load. ОСНО is rational only when (i) you breach all special-regime
limits, or (ii) your customers are large VAT payers who require **input VAT (вычет НДС)** to
deal with you, making your invoices uncompetitive without VAT.

## 3. Страховые взносы Offset and Regional Rates

### The взносы offset — the single biggest legal lever for a small ИП

In 2026 a Russian ИП owes **fixed страховые взносы of 57,390 ₽** plus **1% of income over
300,000 ₽** (additional part capped at **321,818 ₽**). *Verify the indexed figures for the
year.* These взносы directly cut the tax:

- **УСН «Доходы» (6%) and ПСН:** the tax/patent is **reduced by the взносы** — for an ИП with
  **no employees, down to zero**; with employees, by **at most 50%**. Since 2023 the reduction
  may use взносы *due* in the year even if not yet paid (the 1%-over-300k for the year counts).
- **УСН «Доходы минус расходы» (15%):** взносы are a **deductible expense**, lowering the base
  (and you still owe at least the 1% minimum tax). On this object the additional 1%-over-300k
  base is now **income minus expenses** (2026 amendment) — *verify.*
- **НПД:** взносы do not apply (no offset needed; coverage is voluntary, including the new 2026
  voluntary sick-pay scheme).

**Practical effect:** a solo ИП on УСН-6% earning under ~1M ₽ often pays **0 ₽ of УСН** because
the fixed взносы exceed the 6% tax. Always net the взносы against the tax before comparing
regimes — comparing headline rates alone is misleading.

### Regional reduced rates (1% / 5%)

Regions may set УСН «Доходы» as low as **1%** and «Доходы минус расходы» as low as **5%**. For
2026, **eligibility tightened**: a reduced rate now requires the activity to be on the
government-approved list (Government Order **4176-р** of 30.12.2025, under ФЗ **425-ФЗ**),
typically a **≥70% share of income from the qualifying ОКВЭД**, income within the УСН ceiling
(~490.5M ₽), and registration in that region.

**"Register in a cheap region" — proceed with caution (RISK).** Re-registering in a 1%/5%
region purely to cut tax, with **no real substance** (no office, staff, or operations there),
is challenged by ФНС as artificial **налоговая миграция**: tax is reassessed at the standard
6%/15% rate of the region of actual activity, plus penalties. Two guardrails make this mostly
ineffective as a pure trick:

1. **The "three-year rule" (ст. 346.21 НК, ФЗ 362-ФЗ of 29.10.2024):** after relocating, the
   ИП must keep applying the **former region's rate for the next three years** if that region's
   rate was higher — so an immediate move to a 1% region does **not** immediately yield 1%.
2. **Substance test:** real activity, premises, and staff must actually be in the low-rate
   region.

A genuine relocation of the business may legitimately access a lower rate; a paper move will
not. Treat region-shopping as **high-risk** and require accountant sign-off.

---

## 4. The 2026 VAT (НДС) Threshold Lever

From **1 January 2026** a УСН payer becomes a **VAT payer once income exceeds 20M ₽** (down
from 60M ₽; the threshold falls to 15M ₽ in 2027 and 10M ₽ from 2028). The business stays on
УСН (the regime ceiling is still ~490.5M ₽) but loses the VAT exemption. Once over, the ИП
chooses between:

- **Standard VAT** — **22% / 10% / 0%** with the right to deduct input VAT (вычеты); or
- **Special reduced VAT without deductions** — **5%** for income 20M–272.5M ₽, or **7%** for
  272.5M–490.5M ₽.

*Verify the bands and rates against ФНС before applying.*

**Planning lever — stay under 20M ₽.** For a service freelancer with few input costs, crossing
into VAT adds real cost and admin. Legitimate ways to manage it:

- **Time and smooth income** across calendar years so a single year does not breach 20M ₽
  (legitimate timing of invoicing/recognition — *not* hiding income).
- For couples or genuinely separate businesses, keep them **truly independent** — but note this
  is the boundary with the prohibited **дробление** scheme (Section 6); artificial splitting to
  duplicate the threshold is illegal.
- If you must cross, model **5%-without-deductions vs 22%-with-deductions**: with low input
  VAT, the 5% special rate is usually cheaper; with large VAT-bearing costs, standard 22% with
  вычеты can win.

> **Do not** advise splitting one business across several entities/ИП purely to keep each under
> 20M ₽ — that is дробление бизнеса and is reassessed and penalised (Section 6).

## 5. Worked Examples

All figures illustrative, 2026 rules, **research-verified — confirm before acting**.

### Persona A — Low-turnover designer, 900,000 ₽/year, no staff, individual clients

- **НПД:** mostly 4% (individuals) → ≈ **36,000 ₽**, **no взносы**. ✅ cheapest.
- **УСН-6%:** 6% × 900k = 54,000 ₽, but fixed взносы (57,390 ₽) exceed the tax → **УСН = 0 ₽**;
  net cost = the **57,390 ₽ взносы** you must pay anyway.
- **Verdict:** **НПД** — ~36k ₽ total and no compulsory взносы. The simplest, cheapest fit.

### Persona B — Developer, 3,000,000 ₽/year, high margin, no staff

- НПД unavailable (over 2.4M ₽).
- **УСН-6%:** 6% × 3M = 180,000 ₽; взносы = 57,390 + 1% × (3M − 300k) = 57,390 + 27,000 =
  **84,390 ₽**; взносы fully reduce the УСН (solo, no staff) → **УСН ≈ 95,610 ₽**; total burden
  ≈ **180,000 ₽** (84,390 взносы + 95,610 УСН). ✅ usually best for high margin.
- **УСН-15%:** only wins if documented expenses exceed ~60% of income — not the case here.
- **Verdict:** **УСН «Доходы» 6%**, взносы offset applied.

### Persona C — E-commerce ИП, 5,000,000 ₽/year, COGS ≈ 70% of income

- Income 5M ₽, expenses ~3.5M ₽ (70%).
- **УСН-6%:** 6% × 5M = 300,000 ₽ (− взносы).
- **УСН-15%:** 15% × (5M − 3.5M − взносы) ≈ 15% × 1.44M ≈ **216,000 ₽** (above the 1% minimum
  of 50,000 ₽). ✅ cheaper because expenses exceed the ~60% break-even.
- **Verdict:** **УСН «Доходы минус расходы» 15%** — but only with **fully documented** costs.

### Persona D — Consultant, 22,000,000 ₽/year on УСН — crosses the 2026 VAT threshold

- Over 20M ₽ in 2025 ⟹ **VAT payer from 1 Jan 2026** while staying on УСН.
- Few input costs ⟹ little to deduct. Compare:
  - **5% special VAT, no deductions:** 5% × 22M ≈ **1,100,000 ₽**.
  - **22% standard VAT with вычеты:** 22% output, but minimal input VAT to offset → far higher.
- **Verdict:** elect the **5% special rate**; consider whether smoothing turnover under 20M ₽
  in future years is feasible and legitimate. Plus the underlying УСН tax and взносы as in B/C.

## 6. Risks and Red Flags

### RISK — Самозанятый misclassification and the 2-year ban

- **The 2-year ban (ФЗ 422-ФЗ, ст. 6):** income a самозанятый receives from a **client who was
  their employer within the last two years cannot be НПД income** — it is taxed as ordinary
  employment income. No agency, contract relabelling, or "different activity" removes this until
  two full years pass from the dismissal date. **Converting an employee into a "самозанятый"
  contractor is the classic trap.**
- **ФНС scrutiny of company→самозанятый arrangements:** ФНС auto-detects substituted employment
  by matching ИНН in «Мой налог» against ЕФС-1 data. Hallmarks of disguised employment: regular
  fixed monthly pay, working to the client's schedule with the client's equipment, integration
  into the org structure, and **a самозанятый with only one client**. From **February 2026** a
  reinforced monitoring order (Минтруд order 657н of 19.11.2025) adds **quarterly** monitoring
  aimed precisely at firms moving ex-staff onto самозанятый status. *Verify current criteria.*
- **Consequences of reclassification:** the relationship is recharacterised as employment —
  back **НДФЛ** (progressive, from 13%), **страховые взносы (~30%)**, penalties, and fines (up
  to ~100,000 ₽ per substituted contract). This wipes out any "saving" many times over.

### PROHIBITED — Дробление бизнеса (artificial business splitting)

Splitting one genuine business across several formally independent ИП/companies **solely** to
keep each under a special-regime limit (e.g. under the 2.4M ₽ НПД cap, the 20M ₽ VAT/ПСН
threshold, or the УСН ceiling) is **abusive and illegal** under **ст. 54.1 НК РФ** (no business
purpose, only tax benefit). ФНС markers: single management and interdependence; shared office,
staff, IP address, cash system; cross-management; fictitious intra-group transactions. Outcomes
range from tax reassessment as one consolidated taxpayer, through administrative fines, to
**criminal liability (УК РФ ст. 198–199.2)**. A voluntary-disclosure **amnesty** (ст. 6, ФЗ
176-ФЗ) can write off 2022–2024 reassessments **only** if the business genuinely consolidates —
a paper rename does not qualify. **Never design or endorse a дробление scheme.**

### Other red flags

- **Region-shopping without substance** (Section 3) — reassessed at the real-activity region's
  standard rate; the three-year rule blunts any quick win.
- **Hiding income to stay under a threshold** — that is evasion, not planning. Smoothing genuine
  timing of invoices is legitimate; concealing receipts is not.
- **Backdated documents / fictitious expenses on УСН-15%** — only **real, documented** costs are
  deductible.

## PROHIBITIONS

This skill plans tax **legally** only. It must **never**:

- Advise, design, or endorse **tax evasion** — hiding or under-reporting income, fictitious or
  backdated expenses, fake invoices, or off-the-books receipts.
- Recommend **дробление бизнеса** — splitting one real business across multiple ИП/entities to
  multiply special-regime limits or thresholds (ст. 54.1 НК РФ; ст. 198–199.2 УК РФ).
- Help construct a **fictitious самозанятый / disguised-employment** arrangement, or any plan to
  evade the **2-year former-employer ban** or recharacterise employees as contractors to dodge
  НДФЛ and страховые взносы.
- Recommend **paper "registration in a low-rate region"** without genuine business substance, or
  any scheme to defeat the three-year relocation rule.
- Present aggressive positions as safe, or omit a material ФНС risk. When a request crosses into
  any of the above, **refuse the scheme and offer the legal alternative instead.**
