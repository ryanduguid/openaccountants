# Russia — Taxation of Cryptocurrency / Digital Currency (цифровая валюта) for Individuals

This skill computes and explains how Russia taxes **digital currency** — **цифровая валюта**
(*tsifrovaya valyuta*) — for individuals: gains on **disposal** (продажа / обмен), income from
**mining** (майнинг), and the legal status of holding and using crypto. Russia does **not** use a
"crypto" tax category as such; since 1 January 2025 digital currency is **property** (*имущество*)
under the Tax Code, and ordinary НДФЛ rules apply with a few crypto-specific tax-base rules.

Reply to the user in their own language; keep the native Russian terms in parentheses on first use.

> **AI language rule:** Detect the user's language and answer in it. Keep Russian terms verbatim
> (цифровая валюта, НДФЛ, ФНС, майнинг, реестр майнеров, 3-НДФЛ, ЭПР) — the user and their
> accountant will recognise them.

## 1. Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Country | Russia (RU) |
| Tax | **НДФЛ** (personal income tax) on gains — digital currency taxed as **property (имущество)** |
| Disposal gains scale | Special **two-rate** scale: **13 %** up to 2.4M ₽, **15 %** above (capped at 15 %) |
| Mining income scale | **General progressive scale 13 / 15 / 18 / 20 / 22 %**, taxed at fair value **at receipt** |
| Currency | Russian rouble (₽ / RUB) — all amounts converted at **Банк России** rate on the transaction date |
| Legislation | **Федеральный закон № 418-ФЗ от 29.11.2024** (digital-currency tax), amending **НК РФ** глава 23; **№ 259-ФЗ** (digital financial assets / digital currency framework) |
| Authority | **ФНС** — Федеральная налоговая служба (Federal Tax Service), nalog.gov.ru |
| Filing | Annual **3-НДФЛ** declaration, due **30 April** of the following year; tax paid by **15 July** |
| VAT (НДС) | **None** — operations with digital currency and mining are **exempt from НДС** |
| Non-resident rate | **30 %** on Russian-source crypto income, no cost-basis structure parity (verify) |
| Quality tier | **Research-verified — pending sign-off by a qualified Russian accountant** |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults

When facts are missing, default to the position that produces the **higher** tax / the safer
compliance posture, and state the assumption explicitly:

- **Assume tax residency** (≥ 183 days in Russia in the rolling 12 months) unless the user says
  otherwise — non-residents are taxed at 30 % with no resident-style relief, so confirm before relying on it.
- **Assume a taxable disposal occurred** on any sale, crypto-to-crypto swap, or use of crypto to settle
  an obligation. A swap of one token for another **is** a disposal of the first token.
- **Assume mining is taxable at receipt** at market value, even if the coins are never sold.
- **Assume zero cost basis** if the user cannot document acquisition cost — undocumented basis is
  generally **not** deductible. Push the user to produce exchange statements / bank records.
- **Assume the domestic payment ban applies** — never advise using crypto to pay for goods/services
  inside Russia.
- Treat the **foreign-trade settlement regime (ЭПР)** and the 2026 exchange/broker framework as
  **evolving** — verify current in-force status before advising.

---

## 2. Legal status (settled vs evolving)

**Digital currency is property — SETTLED.** Federal Law **№ 418-ФЗ of 29 November 2024** amended the
Tax Code so that, from **1 January 2025**, **цифровая валюта** is recognised as **property (имущество)**
for tax purposes. Consequently disposals and mining are taxable events under НДФЛ. The underlying
civil/financial framework comes from Federal Law **№ 259-ФЗ "О цифровых финансовых активах, цифровой
валюте..."** (digital financial assets / digital currency).

**Holding and investing — LEGAL.** Individuals may **own, hold, buy and sell** digital currency.
Crypto is treated as an investment asset, not as money.

**Domestic payment ban — SETTLED.** Digital currency **may not be used as a means of payment for goods,
works or services inside Russia** (it is not legal tender; only the rouble is). Advising or facilitating
domestic crypto payments is outside this skill's scope and exposes the user to penalties.

**Mining registry (реестр майнеров) — SETTLED for professionals; threshold for individuals — VERIFY.**
- Legal entities (юрлица) and individual entrepreneurs (ИП) that mine on an industrial scale **must
  register** in the **реестр майнеров** maintained by **ФНС**.
- Ordinary individuals may mine **without registration** only if electricity consumption stays within
  the personal limit commonly cited as **6 000 kWh/month** — *verify the current in-force limit*, as it
  is set by Government decree and may change.
- **Self-employed on НПД (самозанятые)** are **prohibited** from mining and from putting mining income
  into the НПД base; mining income goes onto the general НДФЛ scale instead.

**Foreign-trade settlement regime (ЭПР) — EVOLVING.** Under an **experimental legal regime
(экспериментальный правовой режим / ЭПР)** supervised by the **Банк России**, crypto **may be used in
cross-border settlements under foreign-trade contracts**. This is a controlled pilot for businesses, not
a general permission for individuals, and the **Банк России**'s 2025–2026 concept for regulated exchanges,
brokers and "especially qualified" investors is still being built out. **Verify current in-force status**
before advising on any cross-border or exchange-based activity.

## 3. Taxable events & gain computation

### What is a taxable event

| Event | Taxable? | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Buying crypto with roubles | No | Acquisition only; records the **cost basis** |
| Holding crypto (unrealised gain) | No | No mark-to-market for individuals |
| **Selling crypto for fiat** (₽, $) | **Yes** | Disposal; gain = proceeds − cost basis |
| **Crypto-to-crypto swap** | **Yes** | Disposal of the token given up, valued in ₽ at the swap date |
| Using crypto to settle an obligation | **Yes** (and banned domestically) | Disposal at market value |
| **Receiving mined coins** | **Yes** | See §4 — taxed at receipt at market value |
| Receiving crypto as a gift | Maybe | General НДФЛ gift rules; verify per facts |
| Transferring between own wallets | No | No change of beneficial owner |

### Gain on disposal

Gain (the **tax base**, налоговая база) is computed in roubles:

```
Gain = Proceeds (₽, at Банк России rate on disposal date)
     − Documented acquisition cost (cost basis, ₽)
     − Documented related expenses (e.g. exchange fees), where supported
```

- **Cost basis (стоимость приобретения)** is deductible only when **documented** (exchange statements,
  bank transfers, contracts). Undocumented basis ⇒ treat as **zero** (conservative default).
- For **mined coins later sold**, the cost basis is the **market value already taxed at receipt** (§4),
  so the same gain is **not taxed twice**.
- Losses and netting across disposals follow the ordinary НДФЛ tax-base rules for property/financial
  assets — **verify** the exact netting and loss-carry treatment with a Russian accountant, as the
  crypto-specific tax-base rules are new.

### Rate on disposal gains — the SPECIAL two-rate scale (capped at 15 %)

Disposal gains fall into a **separate tax base** that uses **only two rates**, the same upper cap as
securities/dividends income — **NOT** the full five-band general scale:

| Band | Annual disposal gain (₽) | Rate |
|------|--------------------------|------|
| 1 | up to **2 400 000** | **13 %** |
| 2 | over **2 400 000** | **15 %** (on the excess) |

So НДФЛ on disposal gains is **capped at 15 %** — it does **not** reach 18/20/22 %.
This is the most commonly mis-stated point: the headline "up to 22 %" Russian НДФЛ scale does **not**
apply to crypto **disposal** gains.

> **Verify** the exact band and threshold (2.4M ₽) and the cap against ФНС (nalog.gov.ru) and НК РФ
> глава 23 at filing time.

---

## 4. Mining taxation (майнинг)

Mining is taxed in **two stages**:

**Stage 1 — receipt (доход в натуральной форме).** When mined coins are received, the **market value
in roubles at the date of receipt** is **income** and is taxable **immediately**, whether or not the
coins are sold. Value at **Банк России**-referenced market rates on the receipt date.

**Stage 2 — later disposal.** When the mined coins are sold/swapped, the gain is **proceeds − the value
already taxed at receipt** (that value becomes the cost basis), taxed under the §3 disposal rules.

### Rate on mining income — the GENERAL progressive scale (13–22 %)

Unlike disposal gains, **mining income uses the full general НДФЛ progressive scale**:

| Band | Annual income (₽) | Rate |
|------|-------------------|------|
| 1 | up to 2 400 000 | 13 % |
| 2 | 2 400 000 – 5 000 000 | 15 % |
| 3 | 5 000 000 – 20 000 000 | 18 % |
| 4 | 20 000 000 – 50 000 000 | 20 % |
| 5 | over 50 000 000 | 22 % |

Applied **band-by-band** on the excess, not to the whole amount.

### Mining compliance

- **Register** in the **реестр майнеров** (ФНС) if mining as a legal entity / ИП, or as an individual
  above the personal electricity limit (commonly cited **6 000 kWh/month** — *verify current limit*).
- Documented expenses (electricity, equipment depreciation, pool fees) may reduce the mining tax base —
  *verify* the deductible categories for individuals vs ИП.
- **Самозанятые (НПД) cannot mine** within the НПД regime.
- **Informational reporting:** miners are required to report mined-coin data to **ФНС** (volume received,
  wallet/pool identifiers). One widely cited rule is reporting by the **20th of the month following
  receipt** — *verify* this monthly informational filing separately from the annual **3-НДФЛ**
  declaration, as the two are distinct obligations.

## 5. Worked examples

> Illustrative only; rates/thresholds must be re-verified at filing time. All values in roubles (₽).

### Example 1 — simple disposal below the 2.4M threshold

Bought 0.5 BTC for **1 000 000 ₽** (documented), sold for **1 800 000 ₽**.

- Gain = 1 800 000 − 1 000 000 = **800 000 ₽**
- 800 000 < 2.4M ⇒ entire gain at **13 %**
- НДФЛ = 800 000 × 13 % = **104 000 ₽**

### Example 2 — disposal crossing the 2.4M threshold (two-rate cap)

Gain on the year's disposals = **3 000 000 ₽**.

- First 2 400 000 × 13 % = 312 000 ₽
- Remaining 600 000 × 15 % = 90 000 ₽
- НДФЛ = **402 000 ₽** (note: **15 %** is the cap — never 18 %+ on disposal gains)

### Example 3 — undocumented cost basis

Sold crypto for **900 000 ₽** but cannot document acquisition cost.

- Cost basis = **0** (conservative default)
- Gain = 900 000 ₽, all at 13 % ⇒ НДФЛ = **117 000 ₽**
- Lesson: locate exchange/bank records to substantiate basis before filing.

### Example 4 — mining received, then sold (no double tax)

Mined coins received with market value **500 000 ₽**; later sold for **700 000 ₽**.

- **At receipt:** income 500 000 ₽ on the general scale (within band 1) ⇒ 500 000 × 13 % = **65 000 ₽**
- **At sale:** gain = 700 000 − 500 000 (basis = value already taxed) = 200 000 ₽ at 13 % = **26 000 ₽**
- Total НДФЛ = **91 000 ₽**; the 500 000 ₽ is **not** taxed twice.

### Example 5 — mining income high enough to reach an upper band

Annual mining income (value at receipt) = **6 000 000 ₽**, no other income.

- 2 400 000 × 13 % = 312 000
- (5 000 000 − 2 400 000) = 2 600 000 × 15 % = 390 000
- (6 000 000 − 5 000 000) = 1 000 000 × 18 % = 180 000
- НДФЛ = **882 000 ₽** — mining **can** reach 18 % (and beyond), unlike disposal gains.

## 6. Tier 2 — reviewer judgement, references, test suite

### Reviewer judgement (escalate to a qualified Russian accountant)

- **Two-base interaction.** Whether mining-then-sale, multiple disposals, losses, and other НДФЛ income
  net correctly across the disposal base vs the general base — the crypto-specific tax-base rules are new
  (effective 2025) and practice is still settling. **Verify.**
- **Mining deductible expenses** for individuals vs ИП; whether equipment is depreciable.
- **Residency edge cases** (relocation mid-year, 30 % non-resident exposure).
- **ЭПР / cross-border** activity and any 2026 regulated-exchange framework — confirm in-force status.
- **Self-employment overlap** — НПД prohibits mining; ИП on ОСНО/УСН have different rules (УСН generally
  not available for mining). Route to ru-self-employed-npd / ru-usn / ru-income-tax as needed.
- **Penalties / criminal thresholds** for non-reporting — confirm current figures before advising.

### Test suite (expected behaviour)

1. *"What's the crypto tax rate in Russia?"* → НДФЛ; disposal gains **13 %/15 % capped at 15 %**; mining on **13–22 %**; clarify which.
2. *"Is Bitcoin taxed at 22 % in Russia?"* → Only **mining** income can reach 22 %; **disposal** gains cap at 15 %.
3. *"Do I pay tax if I just hold crypto?"* → No tax on holding; tax on disposal/mining.
4. *"Is a crypto-to-crypto swap taxable?"* → **Yes** — disposal of the token given up, valued in ₽.
5. *"Can I pay for coffee with Bitcoin in Russia?"* → **No** — domestic payment ban; not legal tender.
6. *"Is there VAT on crypto?"* → **No НДС** on digital currency / mining.
7. *"I mined coins but didn't sell — do I owe tax?"* → **Yes**, at market value at **receipt**.
8. *"How do I declare?"* → Annual **3-НДФЛ** by **30 April**, pay by **15 July**.
9. *"Can a самозанятый mine?"* → **No** — mining excluded from НПД.
10. *"Can I use crypto to pay an overseas supplier?"* → Only via the **ЭПР** (business pilot); **verify** status.
