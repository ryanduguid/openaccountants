# Russia — Упрощённая система налогообложения (УСН) for ИП and Small Business

The **УСН** (*Упрощённая система налогообложения*, "simplified taxation system") is the
default tax regime for most small Russian businesses. It replaces, for a single flat tax,
the personal income tax on business profit (НДФЛ for ИП / налог на прибыль for organisations)
and — historically — VAT (НДС). The 2025 tax reform broke that last link: from 2026 a УСН
payer above a turnover threshold is **also a VAT payer**. This skill covers УСН for
**individual entrepreneurs (ИП — индивидуальный предприниматель)** and small organisations.

**Related skills.** For freelancers below ~2.4M ₽/year with no employees and no resale of
goods, the **НПД** regime (*налог на профессиональный доход*, the "self-employed" / самозанятый
tax at 4%/6%) is usually simpler and cheaper — see **ru-self-employed-npd**. For the fixed and
1%-over-300k insurance contributions an ИП always owes, see **ru-social-contributions**.

> **YMYL notice.** Russian tax law changed substantially for 2026 (Federal Law 425-ФЗ of
> 28.11.2025; deflator order Минэкономразвития 734 of 06.11.2025). All figures below are
> research-verified against ФНС, КонсультантПлюс, Гарант and major accounting publishers as of
> May 2026. Where a value is annually indexed, the formula is given so you can re-verify the
> current value. **Always confirm against nalog.gov.ru before filing.**

### 1.1 Rates (2026)

| Object | Base rate | Floor (regional) | Tax base |
|--------|-----------|------------------|----------|
| «Доходы» (income) | **6%** | down to **1%** | gross income received (cash basis) |
| «Доходы минус расходы» (income minus expenses) | **15%** | down to **5%** | income less the closed list of deductible expenses |
| Minimum tax («Доходы минус расходы» only) | **1% of income** | — | paid if the 15% computation is below it (incl. a loss year) |

> Note: the старые повышенные ставки (8% / 20%) that applied between the basic and upper
> turnover limits were **abolished** from 2025. There is now a single flat rate per object up
> to the УСН ceiling.

### 1.2 Eligibility limits (2026, deflator коэффициент-дефлятор = 1.090, order МЭР 734)

| Limit | 2026 value | Base × deflator |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Annual income to **stay on** УСН | **490.5M ₽** | 450M × 1.090 |
| 9-month income to **switch to** УСН (organisations) | **337.5M ₽** | 337.5M (not indexed by deflator in the standard reading — *verify current value*) |
| Headcount (average) | **≤ 130** employees | — |
| Fixed assets (остаточная стоимость ОС) | **218M ₽** | 200M × 1.090 |
| VAT (НДС) exemption ceiling — prior-year income | **20M ₽** | statutory (2027: 15M; 2028: 10M) |

Exceeding the income or asset ceiling, or the headcount limit, causes loss of УСН from the
start of the quarter in which the breach occurred.

### 1.3 VAT (НДС) bands for УСН payers (2026)

| Prior-year income | VAT status / rate |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| ≤ 20M ₽ | Exempt from НДС (освобождение) |
| > 20M and ≤ 272.5M ₽ | **5%** without input-VAT deduction, **or** 22% with deduction |
| > 272.5M and ≤ 490.5M ₽ | **7%** without input-VAT deduction, **or** 22% with deduction |
| Standard rate (with deduction) | **22%** (raised from 20% by 425-ФЗ); 10% applies to socially-significant goods; 0% for exports/qualifying IT |

### 1.4 Conservative defaults

When information is missing, assume the more cautious treatment and flag it:

- **Object unknown** → do not guess; the object is chosen once a year and binds for the whole
  year. Ask, or model both.
- **Expense not clearly on the закрытый перечень (closed list, ст. 346.16)** → treat as
  **non-deductible** under «Доходы минус расходы». The list is exhaustive.
- **Expense lacks a primary document / proof of payment** → non-deductible.
- **Income timing** → cash basis: income is recognised when money (or property) is *received*,
  including advances/предоплата.
- **VAT status near 20M ₽** → if prior-year income is at/above the threshold, default to **VAT
  payer** and recommend choosing a rate; do not assume exemption.
- **Regional reduced rate claimed** → verify the specific region's law and the activity code
  (ОКВЭД); from 2026 regions may only reduce rates for activities the federal Government lists.
- **ИП страховые взносы offset** → apply, but cap correctly (see §5.3).

---

## 2. Choosing «Доходы» 6% vs «Доходы минус расходы» 15%

The two objects tax completely different bases. The choice is made for the whole calendar year
and can only be changed from 1 January of the next year (notify ФНС by 31 December).

### 2.1 Break-even logic

Ignoring regional reductions and the взносы offset, the two objects produce the **same** tax
when expenses equal a fixed share of income:

```
6% × Income  =  15% × (Income − Expenses)
=>  Expenses / Income = 0.60   (i.e. 60%)
```

- **Expenses < 60% of income** → «Доходы» (6%) is usually cheaper.
- **Expenses > 60% of income** → «Доходы минус расходы» (15%) is usually cheaper.
- **Around 60%** → other factors decide (see below).

This 60% rule is the headline heuristic. Two adjustments matter in practice:

1. **Страховые взносы offset (§5.3) tilts toward «Доходы».** On «Доходы» an ИП *reduces the
   tax itself* by contributions (in full if no employees, up to 50% with employees). On «Доходы
   минус расходы» contributions are merely a *deductible expense*, so they save only 15% of
   their value, not 100%. This pushes the practical break-even **above 60%** — often to roughly
   65–70% of income before «Доходы минус расходы» wins, especially for low-income ИП whose tax
   can be wiped out entirely by the fixed взносы.

2. **The 1% minimum tax (§2.2) sets a floor on «Доходы минус расходы».** A high-cost or
   loss-making business on the 15% object never pays less than 1% of income.

### 2.2 The minimum tax (минимальный налог) — «Доходы минус расходы» only

At year end compute **both**:

```
Regular tax = 15% × (Income − Expenses)
Minimum tax = 1%  × Income
УСН due     = max(Regular tax, Minimum tax)
```

If the minimum tax is higher (a thin-margin or loss year), you pay the minimum tax. The
difference (minimum tax paid − regular tax) may be **carried forward** and added to expenses /
loss in later years (ст. 346.18). The «Доходы» object has no minimum tax.

### 2.3 Practical decision checklist

- Low costs, services, freelancing (consulting, IT done as ИП, design) → **«Доходы» 6%**.
- Trading, manufacturing, anything reselling goods with a thin margin → **«Доходы минус
  расходы» 15%**, but watch the closed expense list and the 1% floor.
- Strong regional incentive for your activity (rate cut to 1% or 5%) can override the heuristic.
- If income is small enough that fixed взносы exceed the «Доходы» tax, «Доходы» effectively
  costs **0 ₽** of УСН for an ИП without employees — almost always the winner.

## 3. Eligibility Limits and Refusal Catalogue

### 3.1 Who can use УСН

An ИП or organisation may apply УСН if it stays within the limits in §1.2 **and** is not on the
prohibited-activities list of ст. 346.12 НК РФ (banks, insurers, NPFs, professional securities
dealers, pawnshops, gambling, producers of excisable goods other than certain wine/grapes,
notaries and advocates in private practice, organisations with branches, organisations where
another legal entity owns > 25%, etc.).

To start: file the notification (уведомление о переходе на УСН) within **30 days** of
registration, or by **31 December** to apply УСН from the next year.

### 3.2 Refusal catalogue

| Code | Situation | Action |
|------|-----------|--------|
| **R-RU-1** | Income exceeds 490.5M ₽ in 2026 | Loss of УСН from the start of that quarter; move to ОСНО. Out of scope — escalate. |
| **R-RU-2** | Average headcount exceeds 130 | Loss of УСН from that quarter. Escalate. |
| **R-RU-3** | Fixed-asset residual value exceeds 218M ₽ | Loss of УСН (applies to organisations; relevant for ИП too on the asset test). Escalate. |
| **R-RU-4** | Prohibited activity (banking, insurance, gambling, excisable production, etc., ст. 346.12) | УСН not available. Refuse and refer to a practitioner. |
| **R-RU-5** | Organisation has branches, or > 25% owned by another legal entity | УСН not available. Refuse. |
| **R-RU-6** | Client is actually eligible/registered under **НПД** (самозанятый) | Redirect to **ru-self-employed-npd** — usually simpler and cheaper for true freelancers. |
| **R-RU-7** | VAT (НДС) treatment for a payer above 20M ₽ — choosing 5%/7% vs 22%, input-VAT deduction, invoicing | Tier 2: flag and present options; do not auto-decide. See §4. |
| **R-RU-8** | Cross-border transactions, sanctions exposure, EAEU trade, currency control | Out of scope. Escalate — sanctions and currency-control rules dominate. |
| **R-RU-9** | Combining УСН with ПСН (patent), or splitting a business across regimes | Tier 2: anti-fragmentation (дробление бизнеса) risk. Escalate. |
| **R-RU-10** | Whether a specific expense is on the closed list (ст. 346.16) | Tier 2 if not obvious — default to non-deductible and flag. |

## 4. The 2025+ VAT-on-УСН Rules (НДС для упрощенцев)

This is the single biggest change for small business. Until 2024, УСН payers were not VAT
payers. From **2025** (Law 176-ФЗ) a УСН payer whose income exceeds the threshold becomes a
**НДС payer**. The threshold and rates were further changed for **2026** by **425-ФЗ
(28.11.2025)**.

### 4.1 When you become a VAT payer

- Look at **prior-year income**. For 2026 the exemption ceiling is **20M ₽** (down from 60M ₽
  in 2025; falling to 15M in 2027 and 10M in 2028 — *verify*).
- If prior-year (2025) income ≤ 20M ₽ → **exempt** (освобождение) for 2026, no VAT returns, no
  VAT invoices. Exemption is automatic; no application is required.
- If prior-year income > 20M ₽ → you are a **VAT payer** from 1 January 2026 and must choose a
  rate. If you cross 20M ₽ *during* the year, VAT obligations begin from the **1st of the month
  following** the breach.

### 4.2 Choosing the rate

A VAT-liable УСН payer picks **one** regime — you cannot mix:

| Option | Rate | Input-VAT deduction | Income band (prior year) |
|--------|------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| Reduced | **5%** | No (no вычет) | > 20M and ≤ 272.5M ₽ |
| Reduced | **7%** | No (no вычет) | > 272.5M and ≤ 490.5M ₽ |
| Standard | **22%** | Yes (full вычет of input НДС) | any band |

- **5%/7% (без вычетов)** suits businesses with few VAT-bearing purchases (services,
  labour-heavy work) — you charge a small VAT but cannot reclaim input VAT.
- **22% (с вычетами)** suits businesses with large VAT-bearing purchases for resale/production
  — the higher output rate is offset by reclaiming input VAT.

### 4.3 Lock-in period

Once you choose a reduced rate (5% or 7%) **or** move to 22%, you must apply it for **12
consecutive quarters (3 years)** before changing — unless your income falls back below 20M ₽
(exemption) or rises into the next band (5%→7%), which happen automatically. **Exception:** a
payer who chooses a reduced rate for the *first time in 2026* may abandon it for 22% within the
**first 4 quarters** of applying it.

### 4.4 Compliance obligations once you are a VAT payer

- Issue счета-фактуры (VAT invoices) and keep the книга продаж / книга покупок.
- File a **quarterly VAT declaration electronically** by the 25th of the month after the quarter.
- Pay VAT in three equal monthly instalments after each quarter.
- ФНС published **Методические рекомендации по НДС для УСН** (2026) — the primary practical
  reference. Tag all non-trivial VAT-on-УСН questions **R-RU-7 (Tier 2)** and confirm with a
  practitioner; see also the **russia-vat** skill.

---

## 5. КУДиР, Advance Payments, and Страховые взносы Offset

### 5.1 КУДиР (Книга учёта доходов и расходов)

Every УСН payer keeps a **КУДиР** — the tax ledger that supports the declaration.

- **«Доходы»** payers record income only (and, in a separate section, the contributions/payments
  that reduce the tax).
- **«Доходы минус расходы»** payers record both income and the closed-list expenses, each with a
  primary document and proof of payment.
- It may be kept electronically and is **not filed routinely**, but ФНС can demand it on audit.
- Cash basis throughout: income on receipt (including advances), expenses when both incurred and
  paid.

### 5.2 Advance payments and the annual declaration

УСН is paid in **quarterly advance payments** computed on a cumulative (year-to-date) basis,
then trued up at year end.

| Period | Pay advance by | Уведомление (notification) by |
|--------|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Q1 (Jan–Mar) | 28 April | 25 April* |
| H1 (Jan–Jun) | 28 July | 25 July* |
| 9M (Jan–Sep) | 28 October | 25 October* |
| Year — ИП | final tax 28 April; **declaration by 25 April** | — |
| Year — organisations | tax & **declaration by 25 March** (commonly cited 30 March) | — |

\*Because УСН is paid through the **ЕНП / ЕНС** (единый налоговый платёж / счёт, the single tax
account), a **уведомление об исчисленных суммах** must be filed by the 25th before each advance
so ФНС allocates the money. When the 25th/28th falls on a weekend it shifts to the next working
day (e.g. several 2026 dates land on 27/28 of the month — *verify the exact calendar*).

### 5.3 Страховые взносы offset (the big lever for ИП)

An ИП always pays **fixed insurance contributions за себя** plus **1% on income over 300,000 ₽**
(see **ru-social-contributions** for the mechanics). 2026 figures:

- Fixed contribution (full year): **57,390 ₽** — *verify current value*.
- Additional contribution: **1% × (income − 300,000 ₽)**, capped at **321,818 ₽** for 2026.
- Combined maximum: **379,208 ₽** (57,390 + 321,818) — *verify*.
- Deadlines: fixed part by **28 December 2026**; the 1% part by **1 July 2027**.

How contributions reduce УСН:

| Object | Effect of страховые взносы |
|--------|----------------------------|
| **«Доходы»** — ИП **without** employees | Reduce the УСН tax itself **by up to 100%** (tax can go to 0). From 2023 the fixed взносы reduce the tax for the year they relate to even if not yet paid (подлежащие уплате). |
| **«Доходы»** — ИП **with** employees / organisation | Reduce the УСН tax by **no more than 50%**. |
| **«Доходы минус расходы»** | Contributions are a **deductible expense**, not a tax credit — they cut the base, saving only 15% of their value. |

---

## 6. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — «Доходы» 6%, ИП, no employees (the взносы wipeout)

IT freelancer ИП, 2026 income **2,000,000 ₽**, no employees.

- УСН before offset: 6% × 2,000,000 = **120,000 ₽**.
- Fixed взносы 57,390 ₽ + 1% over 300k = 1% × (2,000,000 − 300,000) = 17,000 ₽ →
  total contributions **74,390 ₽**.
- «Доходы» ИП without employees reduces the tax by contributions in full:
  120,000 − 74,390 = **45,610 ₽ УСН** for the year.
- Compare НПД (ru-self-employed-npd): at 6% on B2B income this would be ~120,000 ₽ tax but with
  **no separate insurance contributions** — for some clients НПД is still cheaper. Model both.

### Example 2 — break-even, «Доходы» vs «Доходы минус расходы»

Trader, income **10,000,000 ₽**, expenses **6,500,000 ₽** (65% of income), no employees.

- «Доходы»: 6% × 10,000,000 = 600,000 ₽; less взносы (57,390 + 1%×9,700,000 = 97,000 →
  154,390 ₽) → **445,610 ₽**.
- «Доходы минус расходы»: 15% × (10,000,000 − 6,500,000) = 15% × 3,500,000 = **525,000 ₽**
  (contributions already in the 6.5M expenses). Check minimum tax: 1% × 10,000,000 = 100,000 ₽ <
  525,000 → regular tax stands.
- Despite expenses being **above the 60% rule**, «Доходы» wins here once the взносы offset is
  applied — illustrating why the practical break-even sits higher than 60%.

### Example 3 — minimum tax (loss year), «Доходы минус расходы»

Manufacturer, income **8,000,000 ₽**, expenses **7,800,000 ₽**.

- Regular tax: 15% × (8,000,000 − 7,800,000) = 15% × 200,000 = 30,000 ₽.
- Minimum tax: 1% × 8,000,000 = **80,000 ₽**.
- Pay **max(30,000, 80,000) = 80,000 ₽**. The difference 80,000 − 30,000 = **50,000 ₽** is
  carried forward into next year's expenses/loss.

### Example 4 — crossing the VAT threshold

ИП on «Доходы», 2025 income **35,000,000 ₽** (above 20M ₽), continues УСН in 2026.

- Because prior-year income > 20M ₽, the ИП is a **VAT payer from 1 Jan 2026**.
- Income is in the 20M–272.5M band → choose **5% without deduction** or **22% with deduction**.
- A services business with few VAT-bearing inputs would normally pick **5%**, charge 5% НДС to
  customers, file quarterly VAT returns, and **lock in for 12 quarters**. Flag **R-RU-7 (Tier
  2)** and confirm with a practitioner.

### Example 5 — regional reduced rate

ИП in a region that set a **1%** «Доходы» rate for IT activity (valid ОКВЭД, federal
Government's permitted-activity list).

- Income 4,000,000 ₽ → УСН = 1% × 4,000,000 = 40,000 ₽ before offset.
- Fixed + 1% взносы (57,390 + 37,000 = 94,390 ₽) exceed the tax → **УСН = 0 ₽** (ИП without
  employees). Verify the regional law and that the activity is on the permitted list, since from
  2026 regions may only reduce rates for federally-listed activities.

---

## 7. Tier 2 — Issues Requiring Reviewer Judgement

Flag and escalate (do not auto-decide) when any of these arise:

- **VAT-on-УСН choice** (5% / 7% / 22%, input-VAT deduction, transitional contracts, advances
  across the rate change) — **R-RU-7**. Heavy reliance on ФНС Методические рекомендации 2026.
- **Loss of УСН mid-year** from breaching income/headcount/asset limits — recomputation under
  ОСНО from the start of the breach quarter — **R-RU-1/2/3**.
- **Closed-list expense disputes** (ст. 346.16) — whether a specific cost is deductible at all.
- **Дробление бизнеса** (business fragmentation / splitting to stay under limits) — major audit
  and criminal-liability risk — **R-RU-9**.
- **Combining УСН with ПСН** (patent) and apportioning income, headcount and assets.
- **Switching object** «Доходы» ↔ «Доходы минус расходы» and the timing/notification.
- **Cross-border, EAEU, currency control, sanctions** — **R-RU-8**, out of scope.
- **First-year and short-period** returns; transition in/out of НПД.

Always require sign-off by a qualified Russian accountant before filing.

## 8. Bank Statement Reading Guide (Russian banks) + Reference + Test Suite

### 8.1 Reading Russian bank statements (выписка по счёту)

УСН is cash basis, so the расчётный счёт (current account) statement is the primary source for
income. Major banks: **Сбербанк, Тинькофф (Т-Банк), Альфа-Банк, ВТБ, Точка, Модульбанк**.

Statement columns to expect:

- **Дата операции** — transaction date (income recognised here, on receipt).
- **Назначение платежа** — narrative; the key field for classification. Look for "оплата по
  договору", "за услуги", "аванс/предоплата" (advances are income on receipt), "возврат" (a
  refund — reverses income, not income).
- **Сумма** with **Дебет / Кредит** — кредит (incoming) is income; дебет (outgoing) may be a
  deductible expense (15% object only) or a non-business transfer.
- **В том числе НДС** — whether the line includes VAT; relevant once the ИП is a VAT payer.
- **Контрагент / ИНН** — counterparty and its ИНН.

Classification cautions:

- **Own-funds top-ups** ("пополнение счёта", "внесение собственных средств") are **not income**.
- **Loans received / returned** are not income / not expense.
- **Transfers between the ИП's own accounts** are not income.
- **Refunds to customers (возврат)** reduce income.
- **Personal card spending by an ИП** is generally not a business expense unless it is a closed-
  list business cost with documents — default non-deductible and flag.
- Acquiring/эквайринг settlements: income is the **gross sale**, with the bank's commission as a
  separate (deductible, 15% object) expense — do not net them.

| T3 | Expenses = 60% of income, no взносы | 6% and 15% objects give the **same** tax (break-even) |
| T4 | 2025 income 25,000,000 ₽, continues УСН 2026 | **VAT payer** from 1 Jan 2026; choose 5% or 22%; flag R-RU-7 |
| T5 | Income 600,000,000 ₽ in 2026 | **R-RU-1** — exceeds 490.5M ₽, loses УСН; escalate |
| T6 | Bank line "внесение собственных средств 200,000 ₽" | **Not income** — exclude |
| T7 | True freelancer, 1.5M ₽, no employees, no goods resale | Suggest **НПД** (ru-self-employed-npd) as likely cheaper; model both |

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do not** file or submit any УСН or НДС declaration, уведомление, or payment to ФНС on the
  taxpayer's behalf. Prepare figures only; the taxpayer/practitioner files.
- **Do not** decide the VAT rate (5% / 7% / 22%) automatically — it is a 3-year lock-in; present
  options and require practitioner sign-off (R-RU-7).
- **Do not** treat an expense as deductible under «Доходы минус расходы» unless it is on the
  closed list of ст. 346.16 **and** has a primary document and proof of payment.
- **Do not** advise splitting a business across ИП/regimes to stay under limits — дробление
  бизнеса carries audit and criminal risk (R-RU-9).
- **Do not** opine on cross-border, EAEU, currency-control, or sanctions matters (R-RU-8) — out
  of scope.
- **Do not** present any annually-indexed figure as final without re-verifying against
  nalog.gov.ru for the current period.
- **Do not** assume VAT exemption for a payer whose prior-year income is at or above 20M ₽.

reform — changes frequently and figures are indexed annually; always confirm current values and
