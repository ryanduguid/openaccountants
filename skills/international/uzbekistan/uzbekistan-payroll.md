  Use this skill whenever asked about Uzbekistan (the Republic of Uzbekistan — Oʻzbekiston, Central Asia) payroll processing for employed persons. Trigger on phrases like "Uzbekistan payroll", "Uzbek payroll", "ish haqi", "oylik maosh", "salary tax Uzbekistan", "PIT withholding Uzbekistan", "12% income tax Uzbekistan", "PAYE Uzbekistan", "social tax Uzbekistan", "ijtimoiy soliq", "INPS Uzbekistan", "individual accumulative pension fund", "soliq.uz payroll", "my.soliq.uz", "State Tax Committee Uzbekistan", "monthly payroll report Uzbekistan", "net salary Uzbekistan", "gross to net Uzbekistan", "employer cost Uzbekistan", "minimum wage Uzbekistan", "BCV Uzbekistan", "base calculation value", or any question about computing employee pay, salary withholding tax (PIT), or employer social tax for Uzbekistan-based employees. This skill covers the flat 12% personal income tax withheld at source (the employer is the tax agent), the 12% employer Social Tax (Ijtimoiy soliq), the 0.1% employee INPS pension contribution carved out of PIT, the cumulative monthly withholding method, the monthly payroll report on my.soliq.uz, the minimum wage and Base Calculation Value (BCV), and penalties. CRITICAL: jurisdiction code UZ is the country of Uzbekistan (currency UZS, soʻm) and figures are anchored to PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (reviewed 16 Jan 2026) and the EY Jan-2026 tax alert. ALWAYS read this skill before processing any Uzbekistan payroll.

# Uzbekistan Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — Research-verified.** Rates and structure are cross-verified across PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Uzbekistan, Individual & Corporate; reviewed 16 Jan 2026), the EY Global Tax Alert "Uzbekistan: tax updates effective from 2026" (Jan 2026), LegalAct.uz (PIT cumulative method and the 0.1% INPS carve-out), WageIndicator (minimum wage from 1 Aug 2025) and EOR practitioner guides (Asanify). The official primary sources — the Tax Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (Soliq kodeksi) and soliq.uz — were not directly text-extracted line-by-line; figures rely on the Big-4 / specialist English summaries. Every figure below carries an inline source or a `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` marker. A qualified Uzbek tax adviser / licensed accountant must validate this skill before production use. **Confidence: medium.**

> **CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION.** Jurisdiction code **UZ = the Republic of Uzbekistan (Oʻzbekiston, Central Asia), currency UZS (Uzbek soʻm)**. Do not confuse with neighbouring CIS payrolls (Kazakhstan KZT, Azerbaijan AZN, Tajikistan TJS, etc.) — their rates and forms differ and must NOT appear in this skill.

## Confidence Tier Definitions

Every rule in this skill is tagged with a confidence tier:

- **[T1] Tier 1 -- Deterministic.** Apply exactly as written. No reviewer judgement required.
- **[T2] Tier 2 -- Reviewer Judgement Required.** Flag the issue and present options. A qualified Uzbek tax adviser must confirm before filing.
- **[T3] Tier 3 -- Out of Scope / Escalate.** Skill does not cover this. Do not guess. Escalate and document the gap.

## Section 2 -- Personal Income Tax (PIT) Withholding -- the Employer as Tax Agent

Employment income is taxed at a **flat 12%** of gross salary. The employer acts as the **tax agent**, withholds PIT **at source** at the moment of salary payment, and remits it to the State Tax Committee. There has been **no progressive band since the 2019 reform** — the rate is a single flat 12%. Source: PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Taxes on personal income.

### PIT formula [T1]

```
PIT = PIT base × 12%
```

- For a standard payroll, the **PIT base is gross employment income**. A monthly **1× BCV personal deduction** is available only to **specified categories** of employee (e.g. certain low-income / benefit-eligible employees) — it is **not** universal. Do **not** apply the deduction to a generic payroll without confirming eligibility. Source: PwC WWTS Uzbekistan; LegalAct.uz. See CD6 / `[RESEARCH GAP]`.
- The **0.1% INPS** pension contribution is **carved OUT of the 12% PIT** (Section 3) — it does **not** reduce net pay below `gross × 0.88` and is **not** an additional charge. [T1]
- PIT is computed on a **cumulative (year-to-date) monthly basis**:
  `PIT for the month = PIT(Jan→current month) − PIT(Jan→previous month)`.
  For a flat 12% with a constant monthly salary and no deduction, this reduces to a simple `monthly gross × 12%`. The cumulative method matters when salary varies month to month or when the BCV deduction applies. Source: LegalAct.uz.

### Non-employment / context PIT rates (NOT salary) [T1 / informational]

| Income type | Rate | Note | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Resident employment income | **12%** | The standard payroll rate (this skill). | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual |
| Non-resident employment income | **12%** | Reduced from the former 20% on Uzbek-source income of non-residents (except dividends/interest/freight). Verify treaty relief for genuine non-residents [T2]. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual |
| Resident dividends and interest | 5% | Not employment income. JSC share dividends PIT-exempt for residents & non-residents 1 Apr 2022–31 Dec 2028. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual |
| Non-resident dividends and interest | 10% | Not employment income. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual |
| Non-resident transportation / freight services | 6% | Not employment income. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual |

> These special rates apply to **investment / non-employment income** or to non-residents. Do not apply them to a standard salary computation. If a "salary" turns out to be a dividend, freight payment or IE turnover, this is [T3] — out of payroll scope.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Tax (Ijtimoiy soliq) and the INPS Pension

Uzbekistan has **two** distinct payroll levies in addition to PIT:

1. **Employer Social Tax (Ijtimoiy soliq)** — paid **by the employer, on top of** gross payroll. It is **not** withheld from the employee.
2. **Employee INPS contribution** (Individual Accumulative Pension Fund) — **0.1% of gross**, but **carved OUT of the 12% PIT**, so it is **not** an additional employee cost.

### 3a. Employer Social Tax rate table [T1]

| Payer / case | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Standard commercial entity** | **12%** | Total gross payroll (local + expatriate staff) | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Corporate: Other taxes |
| Budget (state-financed) organisation | 25% | Gross payroll | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Other taxes |
| Specialised workshops employing persons with disabilities | 4.7% | Gross payroll | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Other taxes |
| "SOS Children's Villages of Uzbekistan" association | 7% | Gross payroll | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Other taxes |
| Temporary 1% reduced rate (specified sectors/cases — see below) | 1% | Gross payroll | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Corporate: Other taxes; EY 2026 alert |

- Social Tax is an **employer cost** — it does **not** appear on the employee's payslip as a deduction and does **not** reduce net pay. [T1]
- There is **no upper ceiling**. In practice, where wages are below the statutory minimum wage, Social Tax is computed on **at least the minimum wage** per employee (CD4 / `[RESEARCH GAP]`). [T2]

#### Temporary 1% Social Tax — qualifying cases [T2]

Each has its own sunset date; confirm eligibility before applying. Source: PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Corporate: Other taxes; EY 2026 alert.

| Case | Window |
|---|---|
| Employers of low-income staff earning > 1.5× minimum wage | 1 Jan 2025 – 1 Jan 2028 |
| Employers of students under 30 in vocational training | 1 Sep 2024 – 1 Sep 2027 |
| Qualifying greenhouse farms | per statute `[RESEARCH GAP]` |
| Cotton-textile / knitwear / garment clusters | per statute `[RESEARCH GAP]` |
| Fruit / vegetable sellers | per statute `[RESEARCH GAP]` |
| Children's-content producers | per statute `[RESEARCH GAP]` |

### 3b. Employee INPS pension (0.1%, carved out of PIT) [T1]

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| INPS contribution rate | **0.1%** of gross salary | LegalAct.uz |
| Funded from | **Out of the calculated 12% PIT** — it reduces the PIT remitted to budget and is redirected to the employee's individual pension account | LegalAct.uz |
| Additional cost to employee? | **No** — it is part of the 12%, not on top of it | LegalAct.uz |
| Additional cost to employer? | **No** | LegalAct.uz |

**Arithmetic check.** On `gross × 12%` PIT, the split is: `gross × 0.1%` → INPS pension account; `gross × 11.9%` → State budget as PIT. The employee's total deduction is still **12% of gross**, and net pay is still `gross × 0.88`. [T1]

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].** One secondary news item (newslineuz.com) suggested a planned increase of the INPS rate to **2%**, but that page failed to load (TLS error) and the increase / effective date is **UNCONFIRMED**. Treat INPS as **0.1%, carved out of the 12% PIT** until verified against the Tax Code. Source: research caveat (1).

## Section 4 -- Gross-to-Net and Employer-Cost Computation Order

The deterministic order of operations for a standard monthly payroll of a **standard commercial-entity** employee (no BCV deduction): [T1]

```
1.  Determine gross salary (ish haqi / oylik maosh), in UZS.
2.  PIT = gross × 12%                              (withheld from gross by the employer as tax agent).
        of which: INPS = gross × 0.1%             (carved out; goes to the employee's pension account)
                   to budget = gross × 11.9%       (remitted to the State Tax Committee as PIT)
3.  Net pay = gross − PIT
           = gross × (1 − 0.12)
           = gross × 0.88.
4.  Employer Social Tax = gross × 12%              (standard rate; paid ON TOP of gross).
5.  Total employer cash cost = gross + employer Social Tax
           = gross × 1.12.
```

Source: PwC WWTS Uzbekistan (PIT 12% withholding; Social Tax 12%); LegalAct.uz (0.1% INPS carve-out).

**Arithmetic check:** net multiplier = 1 − 0.12 = **0.88**; standard employer-cost multiplier = 1 + 0.12 = **1.12**. [T1]

> Variant multipliers by employer Social Tax rate (net multiplier is always 0.88, since the employee bears only 12% PIT): [T1]
>
> | Employer type | Social Tax rate | Employer-cost multiplier |
> |---|---|---|
> | Standard commercial | 12% | 1.12 |
> | Budget organisation | 25% | 1.25 |
> | Disability workshop | 4.7% | 1.047 |
> | SOS Children's Villages | 7% | 1.07 |
> | Temporary 1% case | 1% | 1.01 |

## Section 5 -- Conservative Defaults

When a fact is unknown, apply these defaults and flag for the reviewer. Source: research `conservative_defaults`.

| # | Default assumption | Rationale / source |
|---|---|---|
| CD1 | Apply **12%** flat PIT to gross employment income for both residents and resident-status non-residents; for a genuine non-resident, verify treaty relief [T2]. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual. |
| CD2 | Use the **12% standard** employer Social Tax rate unless the entity is a budget organisation (25%) or qualifies for a specific reduced/temporary rate. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Corporate: Other taxes. |
| CD3 | Treat the **0.1% INPS** as **carved out of the 12% PIT** (no extra employee cost) — net pay = gross × 0.88. | LegalAct.uz; research caveat (1). |
| CD4 | Where wages are **below the statutory minimum wage**, compute employer Social Tax on **at least the minimum wage** per employee; flag [T2]. | EOR guidance; exact statutory mechanic unconfirmed `[RESEARCH GAP]`. |
| CD5 | File and pay PIT + Social Tax by the **15th** of the following month. | Asanify EOR guide; `[RESEARCH GAP]` — confirm official deadline. |
| CD6 | Do **not** apply the monthly 1× BCV PIT personal deduction to a generic payroll — it applies only to specified eligible categories. PIT base = full gross unless eligibility is confirmed. | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan; research caveat (2). |

---

## Section 6 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing any payroll [T1]

Ask for any unknown item. Do **not** compute until items 1--4 are confirmed.

1. **Employer TIN (INN / STIR)** and registration with the State Tax Committee.
2. **Pay period and payment date** (PIT is withheld on payment; the monthly report is filed by the 15th of the following month — CD5).
3. **Gross salary for the period**, in UZS. If only a net figure is known, flag for gross-up (gross = net / 0.88) and present as estimate only [T2].
4. **Employer Social Tax category**: standard commercial (12%), budget organisation (25%), disability workshop (4.7%), SOS Children's Villages (7%), or a qualifying temporary-1% case (CD2) [T2 if unclear].

### Refusal Catalogue [T1]

Refuse to produce a final payroll figure and escalate when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Request concerns a **different CIS jurisdiction** (Kazakhstan KZT, Azerbaijan AZN, Tajikistan TJS, etc.) | STOP. Wrong jurisdiction. This skill is Uzbekistan (UZ / UZS). Escalate to the correct skill [T3]. |
| Gross salary not provided (only "net" or "budget") | Gross-up required (gross = net / 0.88). Present as estimate only and flag [T2]. |
| Payment date / pay period unknown | STOP. Report timing depends on the payment date (CD5). |
| Worker is an **individual entrepreneur (IE) / self-employed** | OUT OF SCOPE for payroll. From 1 Jan 2026 the fixed-PIT IE regime is cancelled and a **1% turnover tax** applies to IEs/self-employed with annual turnover up to UZS 1 billion (EY 2026 alert). Escalate [T3]. |
| Income is **not employment income** (dividends 5%/10%, interest, freight 6%, services) | OUT OF SCOPE for this skill [T3]. |
| Employee may qualify for the **1× BCV PIT deduction** | Do not apply it by default (CD6); confirm eligibility in the Tax Code, flag [T2] / `[RESEARCH GAP]`. |
| Genuine **non-resident** with possible **treaty relief** | Apply 12% by default (CD1) but flag [T2]; verify the applicable double-tax treaty. |

## Section 7 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (Deterministic)

Map bank-statement narrations (often Uzbek / Russian / transliterated) to payroll classifications. All patterns [T1] unless flagged. Major Uzbek banks: National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU), Uzpromstroybank (SQB), Ipoteka Bank, Hamkorbank, Kapitalbank, Asaka Bank, Agrobank, Davr Bank.

### 7a. Salary credits to the employee's account

| Narration pattern (Uzbek / Russian / common) | Classification |
|---|---|
| ISH HAQI, OYLIK, OYLIK MAOSH | Net salary payment |
| ZARPLATA, ЗАРПЛАТА (Russian "salary") | Net salary payment |
| OYLIK [month/year], MONTHLY SALARY | Net monthly salary |
| AVANS, AVANS TOʻLOVI | Salary advance — partial net payment [T2] |
| PREMIYA, BONUS, MUKOFOT | Bonus — taxable as employment income (12% PIT applies) [T1] |
| OTPUSKNYE, TAʼTIL PULI | Holiday / leave pay — employment income [T1] |

### 7b. Employer remittances (debits from the company account)

| Narration pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| SOLIQ, DSQ, DAVLAT SOLIQ QOʻMITASI, SOLIQ.UZ | Tax remittance to the State Tax Committee (PIT) |
| JSHDS, JISMONIY SHAXSLAR DAROMAD SOLIGʻI | Personal income tax (PIT) withholding remittance |
| IJTIMOIY SOLIQ, SOTSIALNYY NALOG | Employer Social Tax payment |
| INPS, JAMGʻARIB PENSIYA | Individual Accumulative Pension Fund (the 0.1% carved out of PIT) |
| ISH HAQI, ZARPLATA, PAYROLL, NET WAGES | Net salary disbursement to employees |

> Salaries, PIT and Social Tax are **never** items on a VAT (QQS) return — keep them out of uzbekistan-vat. Cross-reference: uzbekistan-vat.md.

## Section 8 -- Filing Obligations

### Forms [T1 / T2]

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Portal | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly payroll / withholding report** (PIT + Social Tax) | Declare employee gross income, withheld 12% PIT, employee INPS, and employer 12% Social Tax | By the **15th** of the month following the reporting month; tax + contributions paid by the same date | my.soliq.uz | Asanify EOR guide; `[RESEARCH GAP]` — confirm official form designation |
| **Individual annual tax return** (declaration of income) | Filed by individuals where required (multiple income sources, foreign income); most pure-employment taxpayers are settled via employer withholding | **Filing by 1 April** of the following year; **PIT balance payable by 1 June** of the following year | my.soliq.uz | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Tax administration |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].** The monthly report **form name** and the e-filing mechanics (my.soliq.uz, 15th-of-month deadline) come from secondary EOR guides, not directly from the authority. Confirm the current official form designation and deadline against soliq.uz / the Tax Code before relying. Source: research caveat (6).

> For an employee whose salary is fully taxed at source via the employer as tax agent, **no annual return** is generally required — the annual return is for individuals with income (e.g. multiple sources, foreign income) not fully settled by withholding. [T1]

---

## Section 9 -- Minimum Wage and Base Calculation Value (BCV)

Two statutory reference figures drive Uzbek payroll thresholds. Both were reset effective **1 August 2025** by Presidential Decree No. UP-97 (2025).

| Item | Value | Effective | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Statutory minimum wage | **UZS 1,271,000 / month** (up from UZS 1,155,000) | 1 Aug 2025 | WageIndicator; Presidential Decree No. UP-97 (2025) |
| Base Calculation Value (BCV / BHM) | **UZS 412,000 / month** | 1 Aug 2025 | PwC WWTS Uzbekistan, Individual: Significant developments |

- The **minimum wage** is the floor for contractual pay and, in practice, the minimum base for employer Social Tax where actual wages are lower (CD4 / `[RESEARCH GAP]`). [T2]
- The **BCV** is used for the standard 1× BCV monthly PIT personal deduction (eligible categories only — CD6), and for fines, duties and statutory thresholds. [T1]

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All figures in UZS. Each example is recomputed end-to-end. Unless stated, the employer is a **standard commercial entity** (employee net = gross × 0.88; employer cost = gross × 1.12) and **no BCV deduction** applies (CD6).

### Example 1 -- Standard salary, UZS 5,000,000 gross [T1]

- PIT = 5,000,000 × 12% = **600,000**
  - of which INPS (0.1%) = 5,000,000 × 0.1% = **5,000** (to the employee's pension account)
  - of which to budget = 600,000 − 5,000 = **595,000**
- **Net pay = 5,000,000 − 600,000 = 4,400,000** (= 5,000,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax = 5,000,000 × 12% = **600,000**
- **Total employer cost = 5,000,000 + 600,000 = 5,600,000** (= 5,000,000 × 1.12) ✓
- Total to remit (PIT + employer Social Tax) = 600,000 + 600,000 = **1,200,000**

Bank statement: a credit of UZS 4,400,000 narrated `ISH HAQI 03/2025`.

### Example 2 -- Mid salary, UZS 3,000,000 gross [T1]

- PIT = 3,000,000 × 12% = **360,000** (INPS 0.1% = 3,000; to budget = 357,000)
- **Net pay = 3,000,000 − 360,000 = 2,640,000** (= 3,000,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax = 3,000,000 × 12% = **360,000**
- **Total employer cost = 3,360,000** (= 3,000,000 × 1.12) ✓
- Total to remit = 360,000 + 360,000 = **720,000**

### Example 3 -- Minimum-wage salary, UZS 1,271,000 gross [T1]

- PIT = 1,271,000 × 12% = **152,520** (INPS 0.1% = 1,271; to budget = 151,249)
- **Net pay = 1,271,000 − 152,520 = 1,118,480** (= 1,271,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax = 1,271,000 × 12% = **152,520**
- **Total employer cost = 1,423,520** (= 1,271,000 × 1.12) ✓

> Note: there is **no tax-free band** by default — PIT applies from the first soʻm of salary (the 1× BCV deduction is for eligible categories only, CD6). [T1]

### Example 4 -- High salary, UZS 10,000,000 gross [T1]

- PIT = 10,000,000 × 12% = **1,200,000** (INPS 0.1% = 10,000; to budget = 1,190,000)
- **Net pay = 10,000,000 − 1,200,000 = 8,800,000** (= 10,000,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax = 10,000,000 × 12% = **1,200,000**
- **Total employer cost = 11,200,000** (= 10,000,000 × 1.12) ✓
- Total to remit = 1,200,000 + 1,200,000 = **2,400,000**

### Example 5 -- Budget (state-financed) organisation, UZS 4,000,000 gross [T1]

- PIT = 4,000,000 × 12% = **480,000** (INPS 0.1% = 4,000; to budget = 476,000)
- **Net pay = 4,000,000 − 480,000 = 3,520,000** (= 4,000,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax (**25%** — budget organisation) = 4,000,000 × 25% = **1,000,000**
- **Total employer cost = 4,000,000 + 1,000,000 = 5,000,000** (= 4,000,000 × 1.25) ✓

> The employee side is **identical** to a commercial entity (12% PIT). Only the **employer Social Tax rate** differs (25% vs 12%). [T1]

### Example 6 -- Temporary 1% Social Tax case, UZS 2,000,000 gross [T1] / [T2]

Employer qualifies for a temporary 1% Social Tax rate (e.g. low-income staff earning > 1.5× minimum wage, 1 Jan 2025 – 1 Jan 2028 — confirm eligibility).

- PIT = 2,000,000 × 12% = **240,000** (INPS 0.1% = 2,000; to budget = 238,000)
- **Net pay = 2,000,000 − 240,000 = 1,760,000** (= 2,000,000 × 0.88) ✓
- Employer Social Tax (**1%**) = 2,000,000 × 1% = **20,000**
- **Total employer cost = 2,000,000 + 20,000 = 2,020,000** (= 2,000,000 × 1.01) ✓

> **[T2].** The 1% rate is conditional and time-limited (Section 3a). Confirm the employer/employee qualifies and the window is open before applying it; otherwise default to 12% (CD2).

## Section 12 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

| # | Situation | Why it needs judgement | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| T2-1 | Employee may qualify for the **1× BCV PIT deduction** | The deduction applies only to specified categories, not universally | Default to full gross (CD6); confirm eligibility; flag `[RESEARCH GAP]`. |

| T2-4 | **Temporary 1% Social Tax** eligibility / window | Each case has its own conditions and sunset date | Confirm eligibility and that the window is open; else default to 12%. |
| T2-5 | Wages **below the minimum wage** — Social Tax minimum base | Exact statutory minimum-base mechanic unconfirmed | Compute Social Tax on at least the minimum wage (CD4); flag `[RESEARCH GAP]`. |
| T2-6 | **Net-to-gross** gross-up requested | Iterative / rounding-sensitive (gross = net / 0.88) | Present as estimate; flag for adviser. |
| T2-7 | Worker may be an **IE / self-employed** rather than an employee | Wrong regime (1% turnover tax from 2026, not payroll) | Escalate [T3] — out of payroll scope. |
| T2-8 | **INPS rate** | A secondary source hinted at a planned 2% rate (unverified, page failed to load) | Use 0.1% (CD3); confirm against the Tax Code before relying. `[RESEARCH GAP]` |

## Section 13 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested layout for a single-employee monthly payroll working paper. UZS throughout.

| Cell ref | Label | Formula / source |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Pay period (month/year) | input |
| B2 | Payment date | input — drives report timing (CD5) |
| B3 | Gross salary (ish haqi) | input |
| B4 | Employer Social Tax rate (0.12 / 0.25 / 0.047 / 0.07 / 0.01) | input (CD2) |
| B5 | PIT (12%) | `=ROUND(B3*0.12,2)` |
| B6 | of which INPS (0.1%, carved out of B5) | `=ROUND(B3*0.001,2)` |
| B7 | of which PIT to budget | `=B5-B6` |
| B8 | **Net pay** | `=B3-B5` |
| B9 | Employer Social Tax | `=ROUND(B3*B4,2)` |
| B10 | **Total employer cost** | `=B3+B9` |
| B11 | Total to remit (PIT + employer Social Tax) | `=B5+B9` |

Validation rows: confirm B8 = B3 × 0.88; confirm B6 + B7 = B5; confirm B10 = B3 × (1 + B4); for a standard commercial entity (B4 = 0.12), confirm B10 = B3 × 1.12.

## Section 14 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

Uzbek (and Russian) payroll bank narrations and key terms:

| Term (Uzbek / Russian transliterated) | English | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ish haqi / oylik / oylik maosh | salary / wage | gross unless context says net |
| zarplata (зарплата) | salary | Russian — common in narrations |
| avans | advance / instalment | partial salary payment |
| premiya / mukofot | bonus / premium | taxable as employment income (12% PIT) |
| jismoniy shaxslar daromad soligʻi (JShDS) | personal income tax | the 12% PIT |
| ijtimoiy soliq | social tax | employer 12% (etc.) |
| INPS / jamgʻarib pensiya | individual accumulative pension fund | the 0.1% carved out of PIT |
| Davlat soliq qoʻmitasi (DSQ) | State Tax Committee | soliq.uz / my.soliq.uz |
| STIR / INN | taxpayer identification number | employer / individual TIN |
| naqd pul | cash | cash withdrawal — exclude from payroll classification |
| ichki oʻtkazma | internal transfer | between client's own accounts — exclude |

**Conventions.** Uzbek banks export statements in UZS; dates often DD.MM.YYYY. Convert foreign-currency salaries to UZS at the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan (cbu.uz) rate on the relevant date. Narrations may appear in Uzbek (Latin or Cyrillic) or Russian.

---

## Section 15 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement is mid-year or records are incomplete:

1. **No prior monthly reports on hand** → request the my.soliq.uz filing history; reconcile each month's PIT and Social Tax against bank remittances to the State Tax Committee. Do not assume prior months were correct.
2. **Net-only history** → reconstruct gross via the gross-to-net order (Section 4): gross = net / 0.88, iterating for rounding; mark all reconstructed grosses as estimates [T2].
3. **Employer Social Tax category unknown** → default to **12% standard** (CD2) unless the entity is clearly a budget organisation (25%) or a confirmed reduced/temporary case; confirm before finalising.
4. **Worker type unclear (employee vs IE/self-employed)** → STOP and confirm; the IE / self-employed regimes (1% turnover tax from 2026) are out of payroll scope [T3].
5. **BCV-deduction eligibility uncertain** → do **not** apply the 1× BCV deduction by default (CD6); compute PIT on full gross and flag [T2] / `[RESEARCH GAP]`.

## Section 17 -- Test Suite

Each test states inputs and the recomputed expected output. Reviewers should rerun every figure. All amounts in UZS. Unless stated, the employer is a **standard commercial entity** (net = gross × 0.88; employer cost = gross × 1.12) and no BCV deduction applies.

### Test 1 -- Standard salary
**Input:** Gross UZS 5,000,000, paid March 2025, standard commercial entity.
**Expected:** PIT 600,000 (INPS 5,000; to budget 595,000). **Net 4,400,000.** Employer Social Tax 600,000. **Total employer cost 5,600,000.** Total to remit 1,200,000.

### Test 4 -- High salary
**Input:** Gross UZS 10,000,000, paid April 2025, standard commercial entity.
**Expected:** PIT 1,200,000 (INPS 10,000; to budget 1,190,000). **Net 8,800,000.** Employer Social Tax 1,200,000. **Total employer cost 11,200,000.** Total to remit 2,400,000.

### Test 5 -- Budget (state-financed) organisation
**Input:** Gross UZS 4,000,000, budget organisation (Social Tax 25%).
**Expected:** PIT 480,000 (INPS 4,000; to budget 476,000). **Net 3,520,000.** Employer Social Tax 1,000,000. **Total employer cost 5,000,000** (= 4,000,000 × 1.25). Employee side identical to a commercial entity.

**Expected:** PIT 240,000 (INPS 2,000; to budget 238,000). **Net 1,760,000.** Employer Social Tax 20,000. **Total employer cost 2,020,000** (= 2,000,000 × 1.01). Flag: confirm the 1% rate applies; else default to 12%.

### Test 7 -- Net-to-gross gross-up [T2]
**Input:** Known net UZS 4,400,000, standard commercial entity, no BCV deduction.
**Expected:** Gross = 4,400,000 / 0.88 = **5,000,000**; PIT 600,000; employer Social Tax 600,000; total employer cost 5,600,000. Present as estimate; flag for adviser.

### Test 8 -- Wrong jurisdiction guard

### Test 9 -- IE / self-employed guard
**Input:** "Salary" turns out to be individual-entrepreneur turnover.
**Expected:** REFUSE for payroll — from 1 Jan 2026 IEs/self-employed pay 1% turnover tax (up to UZS 1 billion/yr); fixed-PIT IE regime cancelled. Out of payroll scope [T3].

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER confuse **Uzbekistan (UZ, UZS, soʻm)** with a neighbouring CIS jurisdiction (Kazakhstan KZT, Azerbaijan AZN, Tajikistan TJS) — their rates and forms must NOT appear in this skill.
- NEVER apply a progressive band to Uzbek salary PIT — it is a **flat 12%** since the 2019 reform.
- NEVER treat the **0.1% INPS** as an additional employee charge — it is **carved out of the 12% PIT**; net pay is gross × 0.88, not less.
- NEVER add the employer **12% Social Tax** as a deduction from the employee's pay — it is an employer cost on top of gross.
- NEVER apply the **1× BCV PIT deduction** to a generic payroll by default — it is for specified eligible categories only (CD6); flag `[RESEARCH GAP]`.
- NEVER assume the employer Social Tax rate without confirming the category — it ranges from **1% to 25%** (12% standard, 25% budget org, 4.7% disability workshop, 7% SOS, 1% temporary cases).
- NEVER apply a temporary 1% Social Tax rate without confirming eligibility and that the statutory window is open.
- NEVER apply the **IE / self-employed** regime (1% turnover tax from 2026) to an employee's payroll — that is out of payroll scope [T3].
- NEVER guess the **INPS rate (use 0.1%)**, the **penalty/peni amounts**, or any figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` — verify against soliq.uz / the Tax Code.
- NEVER miss the monthly payroll report and payment deadline (15th of the following month, CD5) — confirm the official form designation.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a qualified Uzbek tax adviser / licensed accountant.
