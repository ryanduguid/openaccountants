### PIT Rate Table (2025 — flat system, NO progressive bands)

| Income type | Taxpayer | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employment, rental, capital gains, most other income | Resident individual | **12%** | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Dividends and interest | Resident individual | **5%** | PwC |
| Dividends from JOINT-STOCK COMPANY shares | Resident or non-resident | **EXEMPT** (1 Apr 2022 – 31 Dec 2028) | PwC |
| Employment, royalties, other Uzbek-source income | Non-resident | **12%** (reduced from 20% by Presidential Resolution) | PwC |
| Dividends and interest | Non-resident | **10%** | PwC |
| Transportation (freight) services income | Non-resident | **6%** | PwC |
| PIT in certain designated areas (e.g. Sokh district, Shahimardan / Chungara enclaves) | Resident in designated area | **1%** | LegalAct.uz |

**Uzbekistan PIT is a flat 12% — there are no progressive brackets and no general tax-free personal allowance.** The flat rate IS the system. (PwC)

### Employer Social Tax (ST) Rates — paid by employer, NOT withheld from employee

| Employer category | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard (non-budget) entity | **12%** | total payroll cost (wage fund) | PwC, Other taxes |
| State budget organisation | **25%** | total payroll cost | PwC |
| 'SOS Children's Villages of Uzbekistan' | **7.0%** | total payroll cost | PwC |
| Employers of persons with disabilities | **4.7%** | total payroll cost | PwC |
| Low-income employees relief (temporary, 1 Jan 2025 – 1 Jan 2028) | **1%** | payroll for employees earning above 1.5x minimum wage | PwC |

> Social tax is an EMPLOYER cost on the wage fund. It is **not** deducted from the employee's gross pay. Default to **12%** unless the entity is a confirmed state budget organisation (25%) or qualifies for a documented reduced rate.

### Employee Carve-Out — INPS Accumulative Pension

| Item | Rate | Mechanism | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| INPS (Individual Accumulated Pension Account) | **0.1%** of employee gross income | Carved **OUT OF** the 12% PIT already withheld and redirected to the employee's individual accumulative pension account. **Not** an additional levy on top of the 12%. | LegalAct.uz |

> **Critical:** The INPS 0.1% does NOT increase the employee's burden. Of the 12% PIT withheld, 0.1 percentage point of income is diverted to the individual pension account and 11.9 percentage points go to the budget. The total deducted from the employee is still 12%.
> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the INPS mechanism is sourced to LegalAct.uz (a secondary site). Verify against the Tax Code before relying on the carve-out treatment for a specific client.

### Statutory Base Amounts (from 1 August 2025)

| Amount | Value | Previous | Purpose | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly wage | **UZS 1,271,000** | UZS 1,155,000 (1 Oct 2024) | wage floor | WageIndicator |
| Base calculation amount (BHM / BRV / BCU) | **UZS 412,000** | UZS 375,000 | tax thresholds, fines, state duties, patents, IE minimum social tax | goldenpages.uz |
| Basic pension calculation amount (BVIP) | **UZS 471,000** | UZS 428,000 | pension calculations | goldenpages.uz |

> BHM, BRV and BCU are three names for the SAME statutory base calculation amount.
> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** these figures are reported from the July 2025 Presidential Decree via WageIndicator / goldenpages; the primary decree on lex.uz was not fetched. Confirm before filing.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency status | Treat as **non-resident** until 183-day test is documented (non-resident rates differ by income type) |
| Unknown income type | Treat as employment / general income at **12%** (the universal default) |
| Unknown employer category for social tax | **12%** (standard non-budget) — only use 25% for a confirmed state budget organisation |
| Dividend source unknown (JSC vs other) | Treat as NON-JSC dividend at **5%** (do not assume the JSC exemption) |
| Designated-area 1% rate | Do NOT apply unless the taxpayer's location is documented as a qualifying area |
| Self-employed turnover regime (2026+) | **1% turnover tax** + minimum **1 BHM/month** social tax — do NOT assume the old sub-UZS 100m exemption applies |
| INPS treatment | Carve-out within the 12% PIT — never add as an extra deduction |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- confirmation of (1) residency status (resident if present in Uzbekistan 183+ days in any consecutive 12-month period ending in the tax year — PwC), (2) the type of income (employment, dividends, interest, rental, freight, self-employment/turnover), and (3) the gross amounts in UZS for the calendar year.

**Recommended** -- full bank statement(s) for the tax year in CSV/PDF/pasted text, employer payroll records, dividend/interest vouchers, prior-year declaration, and (for self-employed) turnover ledger.

**Ideal** -- complete income summary by source, social-tax payment records, INPS contribution records, individual-entrepreneur turnover-tax filings, and (for departing expats) date of departure.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No information on residency OR income type = hard stop (the rate cannot be selected). Income type known but no documentation = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced without source documents. The reviewer must verify residency, income classification, and amounts against primary records."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-UZ-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines which rate applies (residents 12%/5%; non-residents 12%/10%/6%). This skill cannot select a rate without knowing whether the individual was present in Uzbekistan 183+ days in the relevant 12-month period. Please confirm."

**R-UZ-2 -- Corporate income tax / legal entities.** "This skill covers individuals, sole traders and individual entrepreneurs only. Companies file corporate income tax / turnover tax separately. Escalate to a qualified Uzbekistan tax practitioner."

**R-UZ-3 -- Designated-area 1% rate claimed.** "The 1% PIT rate applies only to specific designated areas (e.g. Sokh, Shahimardan/Chungara enclaves). Do not apply it without documentary proof of the taxpayer's qualifying location. Escalate to a reviewer."

**R-UZ-4 -- New 2026 special tax regime for foreign citizens.** "A special tax regime for foreign citizens is reported to be introduced from January 2026, but its rate, eligibility and any minimum-salary threshold are unconfirmed. Do not compute under it. Escalate to a qualified practitioner. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]"

**R-UZ-5 -- Penalties / arrears / enforcement.** "Specific late-filing and late-payment penalty percentages and interest (peni) are not confirmed in the available sources. Do not advise on penalty amounts. Escalate to a qualified practitioner. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]"

**R-UZ-6 -- VAT / corporate turnover for entities.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Uzbekistan VAT or company turnover tax, use the relevant Uzbekistan VAT / corporate skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All figures in UZS. Rates per Section 1 (PwC / LegalAct.uz). Arithmetic recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Resident Employee, Monthly Salary

**Input line:**
`31/03/2025 ; NBU ; ISH HAQI MART ; [employer] ; +5,000,000.00 ; UZS`

**Reasoning:**
Resident employment income. PIT = 12% of 5,000,000 = **600,000**. Of that 600,000, the INPS carve-out is 0.1% of income = 0.1% × 5,000,000 = **5,000** redirected to the individual pension account (the remaining 595,000 goes to the budget). The INPS is NOT additional. Net pay to employee = 5,000,000 − 600,000 = **4,400,000**.

**Employer side (not deducted from employee):** social tax 12% × 5,000,000 = **600,000**.

**Classification:** Gross 5,000,000; PIT 600,000 (incl. INPS 5,000); Net 4,400,000.

### Example 2 -- Cumulative Monthly Withholding Check

**Input:** Same employee, gross 5,000,000 in January, February and March.

**Reasoning (cumulative method, LegalAct.uz):** PIT is computed cumulatively: PIT(Jan–current month) − PIT(Jan–previous month).
- Cumulative Jan–Mar income = 15,000,000. Cumulative PIT = 12% × 15,000,000 = 1,800,000.
- Cumulative Jan–Feb PIT = 12% × 10,000,000 = 1,200,000.
- March withholding = 1,800,000 − 1,200,000 = **600,000**. ✓ Consistent with the flat monthly 600,000.

**Classification:** March PIT withheld = 600,000.

### Example 3 -- Resident Dividend from a Non-JSC Company

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; Kapitalbank ; DIVIDEND ; OOO [company] ; +10,000,000.00 ; UZS`

**Reasoning:**
Resident dividend from a limited-liability company (not joint-stock). Rate = 5%. PIT = 5% × 10,000,000 = **500,000**. (If the payer were a joint-stock company, the dividend would be PIT-EXEMPT through 31 Dec 2028.)

**Classification:** Dividend 10,000,000; PIT 500,000; net 9,500,000.

### Example 4 -- Non-Resident Freight Income

**Input line:**
`20/06/2025 ; Hamkorbank ; FREIGHT SERVICES ; [non-resident carrier] ; +50,000,000.00 ; UZS`

**Reasoning:**
Non-resident transportation (freight) services income. Rate = 6%. PIT = 6% × 50,000,000 = **3,000,000**.

**Classification:** Freight income 50,000,000; non-resident PIT 3,000,000.

### Example 5 -- Individual Entrepreneur, 2026 Turnover Regime

**Input:** Individual entrepreneur, annual turnover 800,000,000 in 2026 (≤ UZS 1bn).

**Reasoning:**
From 1 January 2026 turnover ≤ UZS 1bn attracts a **1% turnover tax** (PwC significant developments). Turnover tax = 1% × 800,000,000 = **8,000,000**. Plus minimum social tax of 1 BHM/month = 412,000 × 12 = **4,944,000** regardless of turnover (PwC). The old sub-UZS-100m exemption is abolished from 1 Jan 2026 — do not apply it. Total = 8,000,000 + 4,944,000 = **12,944,000**.

**Classification:** Turnover tax 8,000,000; social tax 4,944,000; total 12,944,000.

### Example 6 -- Annual Salary, Full-Year Reconciliation

**Input:** Resident employee, total annual employment income 60,000,000.

**Reasoning:**
PIT = 12% × 60,000,000 = **7,200,000**. INPS carve-out = 0.1% × 60,000,000 = **60,000** (part of the 7,200,000, not extra). Net = 60,000,000 − 7,200,000 = **52,800,000**. Employer social tax (standard) = 12% × 60,000,000 = **7,200,000** (employer cost, not deducted).

**Classification:** Gross 60,000,000; PIT 7,200,000 (incl. INPS 60,000); Net 52,800,000.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Flat-Rate System

**Legislation:** Tax Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan (in force from 1 Jan 2020, as amended).

Personal income tax is a flat **12%** on employment, rental, capital-gains and most other income of resident individuals. There are no progressive bands and no general tax-free personal allowance. (PwC)

### 5.2 Dividends and Interest (Residents)

Resident individuals pay **5%** PIT on dividends and interest. Dividends paid on **joint-stock company shares are PIT-EXEMPT** for both residents and non-residents from 1 April 2022 through 31 December 2028. (PwC)

### 5.3 Non-Resident Rates

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employment, royalties, other Uzbek-source income | 12% (reduced from 20% by Presidential Resolution) | PwC |
| Dividends and interest | 10% | PwC |
| Transportation (freight) services income | 6% | PwC |

Residency = present in Uzbekistan **183+ days** in any consecutive 12-month period ending in the calendar tax year. (PwC)

### 5.4 Designated-Area Reduced Rate

A **1%** PIT rate applies for individuals in certain designated areas (e.g. Sokh district, Shahimardan, Chungara/Shahimardan enclaves). (LegalAct.uz) Apply only with documented proof of qualifying location — otherwise default to 12%.

### 5.5 Withholding and INPS Mechanism

Employers withhold 12% PIT **cumulatively** each month: PIT(Jan–current month) − PIT(Jan–previous month), remitted with salary no later than the PIT reporting deadline. (PwC / LegalAct.uz)

The **INPS 0.1%** of employee income is carved OUT of the 12% PIT into the employee's individual accumulative pension account — it is NOT an additional levy. (LegalAct.uz; **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the Tax Code.)

Income from a **non-primary** place of work is taxed at a flat 12% without benefits/deductions and reconciled via the annual declaration. (LegalAct.uz)

### 5.6 Employer Social Tax

Social tax on the total wage fund, paid by the employer (NOT withheld from the employee):
- **12%** standard (non-budget) entities
- **25%** state budget organisations
- **7.0%** 'SOS Children's Villages of Uzbekistan'
- **4.7%** employers of persons with disabilities
- **1%** temporary relief, 1 Jan 2025 – 1 Jan 2028, for employees earning above 1.5x minimum wage
(PwC)

There is no general ceiling. Individual entrepreneurs pay social tax of at least **1 BHM/month (UZS 412,000)** regardless of turnover. (PwC)

### 5.7 Self-Employed / Individual Entrepreneurs (2026 changes)

| Rule | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Turnover tax (from 1 Jan 2026) | 1% where annual turnover ≤ UZS 1 billion | PwC significant developments |
| Sub-UZS-100m exemption | ABOLISHED from 1 Jan 2026 | PwC / EY |
| Fixed-amount PIT regime for IEs | CANCELLED from 1 Jan 2026 | PwC / EY |
| IE minimum social tax | At least 1 BHM/month (UZS 412,000) regardless of turnover | PwC |
| Remote registration | From 1 Nov 2025, self-employed/IEs can register remotely via digital platforms with biometric + SMS verification | PwC |

### 5.8 Tax Year and Filing

- Tax year = calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec). (PwC)
- Annual PIT declaration due by **1 April** of the following year; resulting tax due by **1 June**. (PwC)
- Departing expatriates file an exit return at least **one month before departure** (unless leaving before 1 February). (PwC)

### 5.9 Statute of Limitations

Three-year limitation period for individual tax matters; no formal individual audits — declarations are reviewed at filing. (PwC)

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Residency Determination

- Apply the 183-day test over any consecutive 12-month period ending in the tax year.
- Dual residence and treaty tie-breakers require treaty analysis.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm day-count and any applicable double-tax treaty.

### 6.2 JSC vs Non-JSC Dividend Classification

- JSC-share dividends are exempt (to 31 Dec 2028); other dividends are 5% (resident) / 10% (non-resident).
- **Conservative default:** treat as non-JSC (5%) until JSC status is documented.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the legal form of the distributing entity.

### 6.3 Foreign-Source Income of Residents

- Residents are taxable on worldwide income; foreign-source income generally requires an annual declaration.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm foreign-source amounts, foreign tax paid, and treaty relief.

### 6.4 Designated-Area 1% Rate

- Narrow, location-specific relief.
- **Conservative default:** do not apply.
- **Flag for reviewer:** require documentary proof of qualifying location.

### 6.5 New 2026 Special Tax Regime for Foreign Citizens

- A special regime for foreign citizens is reported from January 2026; rate, eligibility and any minimum-salary threshold are unconfirmed.
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the official text. Do not compute under it without confirmation.

### 6.6 INPS Treatment in Take-Home Models

- Treat 0.1% INPS as part of the 12% PIT, never as an extra deduction.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the carve-out mechanism against the Tax Code if material to the model.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Resident monthly salary.**
Input: Resident, monthly gross 5,000,000.
Expected: PIT 12% = 600,000 (incl. INPS 0.1% = 5,000 carved out); net = 4,400,000; employer social tax 12% = 600,000.

**Test 2 -- Cumulative withholding.**
Input: Same employee, 5,000,000 in each of Jan/Feb/Mar.
Expected: March PIT = 12% × 15,000,000 − 12% × 10,000,000 = 1,800,000 − 1,200,000 = 600,000.

**Test 3 -- Resident non-JSC dividend.**
Input: Resident dividend 10,000,000 from an LLC.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a rate without first confirming residency (resident vs non-resident rates differ).
- NEVER add the INPS 0.1% as an extra deduction on top of the 12% PIT — it is carved OUT of the 12%.
- NEVER treat employer social tax (12%/25%/etc.) as a deduction from the employee's gross pay.
- NEVER assume a dividend is JSC-exempt without confirming the entity's legal form — default to 5% (resident).
- NEVER apply the designated-area 1% rate without documentary proof of qualifying location.
- NEVER apply the abolished sub-UZS-100m self-employed exemption to 2026-onward periods.
- NEVER state late-filing/late-payment penalty percentages — they are unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER compute under the new 2026 "special tax regime for foreign citizens" — its terms are unconfirmed.
- NEVER use progressive bands — Uzbekistan PIT is flat.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pending reviewer sign-off.
