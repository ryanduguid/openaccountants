# Italy Tax Optimization -- Self-Employed Skill v1.0

---

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Italy (Repubblica Italiana) |
| Key optimization legislation | Testo Unico delle Imposte sui Redditi (TUIR, DPR 917/1986) -- Art. 10 (oneri deducibili), Art. 15 (detrazioni), Art. 16-ter (riordino detrazioni 2026), Art. 54 (redditi di lavoro autonomo), Art. 66 (contabilità semplificata), Art. 1 commi 54-89 L. 190/2014 + L. 145/2018 (regime forfettario); Legge di Bilancio 2026 (L. 199/2025) |
| Tax authority attitude to planning | The Agenzia delle Entrate accepts legitimate planning. Italy has a general anti-avoidance rule under Art. 10-bis L. 212/2000 (Statuto del Contribuente): arrangements lacking economic substance whose principal purpose is to obtain undue tax advantages can be disregarded. Penalties: 100-200% of unpaid tax for abuse. Ruling requests (interpello) available for certainty. |
| Currency | EUR |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan -- 31 Dec) |
| Filing deadline | 30 November (Modello Redditi PF); Modello 730 typically by 30 September |

### IRPEF Rates 2026 (Legge di Bilancio 2026)

| Taxable income (EUR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 28,000 | 23% |
| 28,001 -- 50,000 | 33% (reduced from 35% in 2025) |
| 50,001+ | 43% |

Plus addizionale regionale (0.9-3.33% depending on region) and addizionale comunale (0-0.9%).

### Detrazioni Limits (Art. 16-ter TUIR, from 2025)

For taxable income > EUR 75,000: detrazioni cap of EUR 14,000 (income EUR 75,000-100,000) or EUR 8,000 (income > EUR 100,000), multiplied by coefficient based on number of dependent children. For income > EUR 120,000: progressive reduction of Art. 15 detrazioni. For income > EUR 200,000: additional EUR 440 reduction.

## Section 2 -- Income Splitting & Structuring

### Regime Forfettario vs Regime Ordinario

| Factor | Regime Forfettario | Regime Ordinario |
|---|---|---|
| Revenue ceiling | EUR 85,000 (immediate exit if > EUR 100,000) | No limit |
| Tax rate | 15% flat (imposta sostitutiva) -- replaces IRPEF, addizionali, IRAP | Progressive IRPEF 23-43% + addizionali |
| Start-up rate | 5% for first 5 years (if conditions met) | N/A |
| Expense deduction | No actual expenses -- profitability coefficient applied to revenue | Actual expenses deducted |
| VAT | No VAT charged or recovered | Standard VAT rules |
| Social contributions | Deductible from forfettario income | Deductible from ordinary income |
| Exclusion criteria | Employment income > EUR 35,000 in prior year (if not ceased); participation in SRL with connected activity; more than EUR 20,000 in gross employee costs | N/A |

**Legislation:** Art. 1 commi 54-89, L. 190/2014, as amended by L. 145/2018, L. 197/2022, L. 199/2025

**Strategy:** For a professional (BNC) with EUR 60,000 revenue and actual expenses of EUR 10,000: forfettario taxable income = EUR 60,000 × 22% coefficient (depending on ATECO) = EUR 13,200 → tax at 15% = EUR 1,980. Under ordinary regime: EUR 50,000 taxable → IRPEF ~EUR 12,620 + addizionali. The forfettario saves over EUR 10,000.

### SRL (Società a Responsabilità Limitata) vs Ditta Individuale

| Factor | Ditta Individuale | SRL |
|---|---|---|
| Top tax rate | 43% IRPEF + addizionali | 24% IRES + 3.9% IRAP = ~28% |
| Extraction costs | N/A | Dividends: 26% withholding on distributed profits |
| When to incorporate | When profits consistently exceed EUR 50,000 and can be retained | Requires notarial deed, annual accounts, compliance costs |

### Impresa Familiare (Family Business)

Up to 49% of business income can be attributed to family members who participate in the business. Each member is taxed individually at their own marginal rate.

**Legislation:** TUIR Art. 5, comma 4; Art. 230-bis Codice Civile

---

## Section 3 -- Deductions Most People Miss

### Oneri Deducibili (reduce taxable income) -- TUIR Art. 10

| Deduction | Detail | Legislation |
|---|---|---|
| Contributi previdenziali | Social security contributions (INPS gestione separata/artigiani/commercianti) fully deductible from taxable income | Art. 10 comma 1 lett. e) |
| Fondi pensione integrativi | Contributions to supplementary pension funds deductible up to EUR 5,300/year (increased from EUR 5,164.57 by L.B. 2026). TFR allocations do not count against this limit. | Art. 10 comma 1 lett. e-bis) |
| Assegni periodici (alimony) | Periodic maintenance payments to ex-spouse (not child support) are deductible | Art. 10 comma 1 lett. c) |
| Contributi previdenziali per collaboratori domestici | Contributions for domestic workers up to EUR 1,549.37/year | Art. 10 comma 2 |

### Detrazioni (reduce tax payable) -- TUIR Art. 15

| Detrazione | Rate | Cap | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spese sanitarie (medical) | 19% | Above EUR 129.11 threshold; no cap | Always deductible regardless of income (exempt from Art. 16-ter cap) |
| Interessi mutuo abitazione principale | 19% | Max EUR 4,000/year interest | Mortgage interest on primary residence |
| Spese istruzione (education) | 19% | Max EUR 800/year per student | University, school fees |
| Spese funebri | 19% | Max EUR 1,550 per event | Funeral expenses |
| Assicurazione vita/infortuni | 19% | Max EUR 530 premium | Life/accident insurance premiums |
| Erogazioni liberali (donations) | 19-30% | Various limits | Donations to ONLUS (30%), political parties (26%), cultural heritage (65%) |
| Spese veterinarie | 19% | EUR 129.11 -- EUR 550 range | Pet veterinary expenses |
| Bonus edilizi (building renovations) | 50-65% | EUR 96,000 per unit (standard bonus ristrutturazione) | Spread over 10 years. Includes Ecobonus, Sismabonus. |
| Bonus mobili | 50% | EUR 5,000 (2025/2026) | Furniture/appliances for renovated property |

---

## Section 4 -- Capital Allowances Optimization

**Legislation:** TUIR Art. 102 (ammortamento), DM 31/12/1988 (coefficienti di ammortamento)

### Ammortamento (Depreciation)

| Asset category | Rate (ministerial coefficient) |
|---|---|
| Office equipment | 20% |
| Electronic equipment, computers | 20% |
| Office furniture | 12% |
| Motor vehicles (professional use) | 25% |
| Buildings (commercial) | 3% |

First year: 50% of the normal rate (half-year convention).

### Beni strumentali < EUR 516.46

Assets costing less than EUR 516.46 can be fully expensed in the year of purchase (Art. 102 comma 5 TUIR). Use this threshold to time smaller purchases.

### Motor Vehicle Deduction Limits (Art. 164 TUIR)

| Category | Deductible cost cap | Deductible % |
|---|---|---|
| Agent/representative | EUR 25,822.84 | 80% |
| Professional (use for work) | EUR 18,075.99 | 20% |
| Exclusive business use | Full cost | 100% |

**Strategy:** For professionals, the deduction on cars is severely limited (20% of costs up to EUR 18,075.99). Consider whether leasing (with deduction limits) or using the vehicle as a personal expense is more tax-efficient. Agents benefit from 80% deductibility.

---

## Section 5 -- Loss Utilization

**Legislation:** TUIR Art. 8, Art. 84

| Relief | Detail |
|---|---|
| Horizontal offset (same year) | Losses from one category of income can offset gains in other categories within the same year (e.g., business loss offsets rental income). |
| Carry-forward (impresa) | Business losses carry forward indefinitely but can only offset up to 80% of future business income (minimum taxation rule). |
| First 3 years exception | Losses from the first 3 years of a new business can be carried forward without the 80% limitation -- full offset allowed. |
| No carry-back | Italy does not allow loss carry-back. |
| Forfettario losses | The regime forfettario does not generate deductible losses. If the coefficient-based income is lower than social contributions, the excess contributions carry forward. |

### Strategy

In the start-up phase (first 3 years), maximize deductible expenses to create large losses. These carry forward with full offset (no 80% limit), providing significant future tax savings once profitability is achieved.

---

## Section 6 -- Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Regime forfettario threshold management | If revenue is approaching EUR 85,000, defer invoicing to January to remain in the regime. If revenue exceeds EUR 100,000, exit is immediate (mid-year). |
| Accelerate deductions (ordinario) | Prepay professional insurance, subscriptions, training before 31 December. Under contabilità semplificata (regime di cassa), expenses are deductible when paid. |
| Acconti management | IRPEF advance payments (acconti) in June (40%) and November (60%) are based on prior-year liability. If current-year income is lower, use the metodo previsionale to reduce acconti. Risk: 10% penalty if underestimated by > 10%. |
| Fondo pensione contributions | Maximize EUR 5,300 deduction before 31 December. |
| Building bonus timing | Start renovation works and make payments via bonifico parlante before year-end to claim the detrazione in the current year's return. |
| Employment income threshold (forfettario) | If transitioning from employment, ensure employment income in the prior year was ≤ EUR 35,000 (or that the relationship ended). |

---

## Section 7 -- VAT Optimization (IVA)

**Legislation:** DPR 633/1972

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Regime forfettario | No IVA charged or recovered. Simplifies compliance. Competitive for B2C (clients see lower prices). |
| Regime dei minimi (historical) | Closed to new entrants since 2016, but existing beneficiaries may still be in it. |
| IVA per cassa (cash-basis VAT) | Pay output IVA only when payment is received. Available if turnover ≤ EUR 2 million. | 
| Split payment (scissione dei pagamenti) | Public sector clients withhold IVA and pay directly to Erario. Reduces cash flow impact but creates IVA credit positions. |
| IVA credit refund vs offset | Quarterly IVA credits > EUR 2,582.28 can be refunded (with guarantee requirements above EUR 30,000) or offset against other taxes (F24). |
| Reverse charge (inversione contabile) | For specific sectors (construction sub-contracting, cleaning): no output IVA. Report via reverse charge. Requires careful documentation. |
| Voluntary registration (forfettario) | Even in forfettario, you may need to charge IVA on intra-EU acquisitions above EUR 10,000. Plan accordingly. |

---

## Section 8 -- Social Security Optimization

**Legislation:** L. 335/1995 (riforma Dini); Circolari INPS

### INPS Contribution Structures

| Category | Contribution rate (2025/2026) | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Gestione Separata (professionals without cassa) | 26.07% (without other coverage) / 24% (with other coverage) | Net income |
| Artigiani/Commercianti | ~24% up to EUR 55,448; 25% above | Minimum income EUR 18,415 → minimum contribution ~EUR 4,427 |
| Casse professionali (regulated professions) | Varies by cassa (Inarcassa, Cassa Forense, etc.) | Varies |

### Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Forfettario 35% reduction | Artigiani/Commercianti in regime forfettario can request a 35% reduction in INPS contributions. Application via Cassetto Previdenziale, valid for the calendar year. |
| Gestione Separata income management | Contributions are proportional to income. Lower income = lower contributions. But this also reduces future pension. |
| Cassa professionale optimization | Some casse offer reduced rates for young professionals or in the first years of activity. Check specific cassa rules. |
| Social contributions as deduction | All INPS/cassa contributions are fully deductible from taxable income (Art. 10 TUIR). In forfettario, they reduce the flat-tax base directly. |
| Minimum contribution planning | Artigiani/Commercianti pay a minimum contribution regardless of income. If income is very low, consider whether the minimum is excessive relative to the pension benefit. |

## Section 9 -- Investment & Retirement

### Fondi Pensione Integrativi (Supplementary Pension) -- TUIR Art. 10, D.Lgs. 252/2005

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Annual deduction limit | EUR 5,300 (from 2026, increased from EUR 5,164.57) |
| TFR contributions | Do not count against the EUR 5,300 limit. TFR allocated to the fund has its own favorable taxation (max 23% on a reduced base). |
| Taxation on exit | 15%, reduced by 0.30% for each year of participation beyond the 15th, down to a minimum of 9%. |
| First-job bonus | Employees in their first 5 years can accumulate unused deduction capacity (up to EUR 2,582.29/year extra) for use in later years. |

**Strategy:** A self-employed professional earning EUR 80,000 contributing EUR 5,300 to a fondo pensione saves: EUR 5,300 × 43% (marginal rate) = EUR 2,279 in IRPEF. At exit (after 35+ years of participation), the fund is taxed at only 9%.

### PIR (Piani Individuali di Risparmio)

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tax treatment | Gains and income from PIR-compliant investments are exempt from capital gains tax (26%) and IVAFE. |
| Annual limit | EUR 40,000, lifetime limit EUR 200,000 |
| Holding period | Minimum 5 years |
| Strategy | Shelter investment gains from the 26% capital gains tax. |

### Bonus Investimenti

Various tax credits for capital investments (Industria 4.0, Transizione 5.0) may still be available for business equipment purchases, though availability changes annually.

| Evasion vs avoidance | Italy has a low threshold for what constitutes criminal tax evasion: > EUR 150,000 in undeclared income or > EUR 50,000 in IRPEF evaded = criminal liability. |
| Impresa familiare formality | Must be established via notarial deed registered within the relevant tax year. Retroactive attribution is not possible. |
| Motor vehicle deduction abuse | Claiming 100% business use on a personal vehicle without documentation will be disallowed. |
| Detrazioni cap (Art. 16-ter) | For income > EUR 75,000, total detrazioni are capped. Exceeding the cap means lost tax benefits. Plan detrazioni-eligible expenditure accordingly. |
