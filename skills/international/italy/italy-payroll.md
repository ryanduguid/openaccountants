## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (IRPEF)

The employer (sostituto d'imposta) withholds IRPEF monthly from the employee's gross pay after deducting INPS employee contributions. Cumulative method used.

### IRPEF Tax Brackets (2026 -- Legge di Bilancio 2026)

| Taxable Income (EUR, annual) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 28,000 | 23% |
| 28,001 -- 50,000 | 33% |
| 50,001+ | 43% |

**Key 2026 change:** The second bracket rate dropped from 35% to 33%, saving up to EUR 440/year for employees with income between EUR 28,000 and EUR 50,000.

For incomes above EUR 200,000, a neutralisation mechanism (sterilizzazione) claws back the benefit of the 33% rate reduction (Art. 1, commi 3--4, L. 199/2025).

### Tax-Free Threshold and Detrazioni per Lavoro Dipendente

| Income Range (EUR) | Detrazione (Employment Deduction) |
|---|---|
| Up to 8,500 (no tax area) | IRPEF = 0 (deduction fully offsets tax) |
| 8,501 -- 15,000 | EUR 1,955 (maximum) |
| 15,001 -- 50,000 | Decreasing progressively; minimum EUR 690 |
| Above 50,000 | EUR 690 fixed |

### Addizionali IRPEF (Regional and Municipal Surcharges)

| Surcharge | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Addizionale regionale | 1.23% -- 3.33% | Varies by region of residence |
| Addizionale comunale | 0% -- 0.9% | Varies by municipality; some have progressive brackets |

Addizionali for the prior year are withheld in monthly instalments from January to November of the current year (e.g., 2025 addizionali withheld Jan--Nov 2026). Current-year acconto may also be withheld.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (2026)

### INPS Contributions (Employee Share)

| Contribution | Employee Rate | Base | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| IVS (Invalidità, Vecchiaia, Superstiti) | 9.19% | Up to INPS ceiling | General rate for industry/commerce employees |
| IVS above ceiling | 9.19% continues but only employer pays excess | Above EUR 122,295/year | For post-1996 first-insured (L. 335/95) |
| Fondo di garanzia TFR | -- | -- | No employee share |
| CIG (Cassa Integrazione Guadagni) | -- | -- | Employer-only for most sectors |
| CIGS (for companies > 15 employees) | -- | -- | Employer-only |

**Note:** The 9.19% rate is the standard for most private-sector employees (operai and impiegati in industry and commerce). Actual rates vary by CCNL (Contratto Collettivo Nazionale di Lavoro), sector, and employee classification. Common variants:

| Sector | Employee Rate |
|---|---|
| Industry (> 15 employees) | 9.19% |
| Commerce/services | 9.19% |
| Agriculture | 8.84% |
| Dirigenti (managers) | 9.19% |

### INPS Ceiling (Massimale, 2026)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Massimale annuo (post-1996 contributors) | EUR 122,295 |
| Minimale annuo | EUR 18,808 |

The massimale applies only to workers first insured after 1 January 1996 with no prior contributions under the old system.

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions (2026)

### INPS Contributions (Employer Share)

The total INPS rate is approximately 30--33% for the employer, depending on sector, company size, and applicable reductions. The main components:

| Contribution | Approximate Employer Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IVS (pension) | ~23.81% | Main pension contribution |
| Malattia (sickness) | 2.22% | Industry; 0% for commerce impiegati (INPS covers) |
| Maternità | 0.46% | |
| Disoccupazione (NASpI unemployment) | 1.61% | |
| CIG ordinaria (companies ≤ 50 employees, industry) | 1.70% | Varies by sector |
| CIGS (companies > 50 employees) | 0.90% | Additional |
| Fondo di garanzia TFR | 0.20% | |
| CUAF (assegni familiari) | 0.68% | Family allowances |
| INAIL (accident insurance) | Variable (0.4%--12%+) | Risk-based; separate from INPS |

### Typical Total Employer Rates

| Sector | Approximate Total Employer Rate |

| Industry (> 50 employees) | ~31--33% |
| Industry (≤ 50 employees) | ~30--31% |
| Commerce / services | ~28--30% |
| Dirigenti | ~33--35% |

These rates apply on gross salary without ceiling for most components. IVS above the massimale: employer pays an additional ~1% on amounts exceeding EUR 122,295 (no employee share above ceiling).

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (IRPEF + INPS) | **This skill (italy-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed income tax | italy-income-tax.md |
| Italian VAT (IVA) | italy-vat-return.md |
| Bookkeeping | italy-bookkeeping.md |
| E-invoicing (FatturaPA / SDI) | italy-einvoice.md |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages + employer INPS + INAIL + TFR accrual are P&L expenses. Employee IRPEF, addizionali, and INPS deductions are liabilities (debiti verso erario / debiti verso INPS) until F24 payment. TFR is a liability (fondo TFR) until paid or transferred.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** CU data feeds into the employee's Modello 730 or Redditi PF. The sostituto d'imposta processes 730 refunds/debits in monthly payroll (July--November).
- **Payroll → INPS:** UniEmens monthly submissions reconcile with F24 payments. Annual CU data must match UniEmens totals.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a flat tax rate -- Italy uses progressive IRPEF brackets with detrazioni
- NEVER forget addizionali regionali and comunali -- they are separate from IRPEF and vary by residence
- NEVER omit the tredicesima (13th month) -- it is legally required for all employees
- NEVER confuse the INPS massimale (EUR 122,295) with a general salary cap -- it only affects post-1996 contributors
- NEVER compute TFR without the Art. 2120 formula (gross / 13.5 + revaluation)
- NEVER miss the F24 deadline (16th of the month) -- penalties and interest apply immediately
- NEVER issue a busta paga without all mandatory fields per L. 4/1953
- NEVER assume a national minimum wage exists -- use the applicable CCNL
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- direct to a commercialista or consulente del lavoro for sign-off
