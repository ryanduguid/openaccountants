## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Phase 1 -- Generation (All Taxpayers Since Dec 2021)

- ALL VAT-registered taxpayers in KSA
- Must generate e-invoices (and credit/debit notes) using a compliant electronic system
- Paper invoices no longer legally valid
- Basic QR code required on simplified (B2C) invoices
- No system-to-system integration required

### Phase 2 -- Integration (Wave-Based)

- System must integrate with ZATCA's FATOORA platform via API
- **Standard Tax Invoice (B2B)**: Must be cleared by ZATCA before delivery to buyer
- **Simplified Tax Invoice (B2C)**: Must be reported to ZATCA within 24 hours
- Cryptographic stamp (digital signature) required on all invoices
- Enhanced QR code with TLV-encoded cryptographic data

### Document Types

| Type | Code | SubType Code | Clearance Model |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard Tax Invoice (B2B) | 388 | 0100000 | Real-time clearance (before sharing with buyer) |
| Simplified Tax Invoice (B2C) | 388 | 0200000 | Near-real-time reporting (within 24 hours) |
| Standard Credit Note | 381 | 0100000 | Clearance |

| Standard Debit Note | 383 | 0100000 | Clearance |
| Simplified Debit Note | 383 | 0200000 | Reporting |

### Exemptions

- None for Phase 1 — all VAT-registered taxpayers must comply
- Phase 2 integration is wave-based by revenue; ZATCA notifies targeted groups 6 months in advance

## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### Onboarding Process

1. Register on FATOORA portal (fatoora.zatca.gov.sa) using ZATCA credentials
2. Generate OTP (One-Time Password) per EGS device
3. EGS generates ECDSA private key (secp256k1) and Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
4. Submit CSR + OTP to Compliance CSID API → receive Compliance CSID (temporary certificate)
5. Run 3 compliance checks (standard invoice, simplified invoice, credit note)
6. Submit compliance check results → receive Production CSID (permanent certificate)
7. Begin production clearance/reporting

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| /compliance | POST | Onboarding — get Compliance CSID |
| /production/csids | POST | Get Production CSID |
| /compliance/invoices | POST | Submit compliance test invoices |
| /invoices/clearance | POST | Clear standard (B2B) invoices |
| /invoices/reporting | POST | Report simplified (B2C) invoices |

### Production Base URL

```
https://gw-fatoora.zatca.gov.sa/e-invoicing/developer-portal
```

### Authentication

- HTTP Basic Auth using Base64-encoded `{CSID_binary_token}:{secret}`
- Each EGS device has its own certificate and credentials
- Certificate renewal required before expiry

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### ZATCA Server-Side Validation

1. XML schema validation against UBL 2.1 + ZATCA CIUS
2. Cryptographic signature verification (ECDSA secp256k1)
3. Certificate chain validation (must be ZATCA-issued)
4. Invoice hash verification (SHA-256 of canonical form)
5. Previous invoice hash chain integrity
6. UUID uniqueness check
7. Invoice Counter Value (ICV) sequence validation
8. Tax calculation verification (line totals, tax amounts)
9. Seller VAT number validity
10. Buyer VAT number validity (standard invoices)

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Code | Description | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| INVALID-SIGNATURE | Signature verification failed | Regenerate signature with correct private key |
| INVALID-CERTIFICATE | Certificate not issued by ZATCA | Re-onboard the EGS device |
| DUPLICATE-UUID | UUID already submitted | Generate new UUID per RFC 4122 |
| INVALID-HASH | Invoice hash does not match content | Recompute SHA-256 on canonical XML |
| PIH-MISMATCH | Previous invoice hash incorrect | Use hash of actual last invoice |
| TAX-CALC-ERROR | Tax amounts do not compute | Verify: TaxAmount = TaxableAmount × Rate |
| MISSING-FIELD | Required field absent | Add missing UBL element |

### Validation Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| CLEARED | Standard invoice accepted (can share with buyer) |
| REPORTED | Simplified invoice acknowledged |
| REJECTED | Validation failed — must fix and resubmit |
| WARNING | Non-blocking issue — invoice accepted but flagged |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### VAT Rates in KSA

| Category | Code | Rate | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard | S | 15% | Default rate |
| Zero-rated | Z | 0% | Exports, international transport |
| Exempt | E | 0% | Financial services, residential rent |
| Out of scope | O | 0% | Government services |

### Calculation Rules

- Line Extension Amount = Quantity × Unit Price - Discount
- Tax Amount per line = Line Extension Amount × Tax Rate / 100
- Rounding: 2 decimal places (round half-up)
- Document-level TaxTotal must equal sum of all line tax amounts (tolerance: SAR 0.01)
- TaxInclusiveAmount = TaxExclusiveAmount + TaxTotal

### Multi-Rate Invoice

- Each line item carries its own TaxCategory and Percent
- TaxTotal contains multiple TaxSubtotal elements (one per distinct rate)
- Each TaxSubtotal aggregates TaxableAmount and TaxAmount for that rate

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention Period | Minimum 6 years from end of tax period (VAT Implementing Regulations Art. 66) |
| Format | Original XML (signed) + ZATCA response |
| Digital Signature | Must retain the signed XML with embedded UBL Extensions containing the signature |
| Integrity | Invoice hash chain provides tamper evidence |
| Medium | Electronic storage; must be accessible on demand by ZATCA |
| QR Code | Physical/PDF copies must display the complete TLV QR code |
| Language | Arabic required for invoice content; bilingual (Arabic + English) permitted |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Violation | Penalty (SAR) |
|---|---|
| Not issuing e-invoices | 5,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Not including required fields | 5,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Not integrating with FATOORA (Phase 2) | 5,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Deleting or modifying e-invoices after issuance | 10,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Not storing e-invoices per requirements | 5,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Obstructing ZATCA officials | 5,000 -- 50,000 per violation |
| Repeated violations | Penalty doubled; potential business suspension |

ZATCA may also publish violator names publicly and may suspend tax registration for severe/repeated non-compliance.

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### VAT Return Integration

- Cleared B2B invoices feed directly into ZATCA's VAT return pre-population
- Reported B2C invoices aggregated for VAT return box totals
- VAT return data (Box 1: standard-rated sales, Box 2: zero-rated, etc.) can be cross-referenced against FATOORA submission records
- Discrepancies between submitted e-invoices and VAT return values trigger ZATCA risk-assessment flags

### Credit Note Handling

- Credit notes must reference the original invoice UUID
- Tax adjustments in VAT return derived from cleared credit notes
- ZATCA validates that credit note does not exceed original invoice value

### Withholding Tax

- If withholding tax applies (certain services), the invoice must still show full VAT amount
- Withholding is a separate mechanism; e-invoice shows gross amounts

### Audit Trail

- ZATCA maintains complete record of all cleared/reported invoices
- Taxpayer's records must match ZATCA's records exactly
- UUID + ICV provide unique identification for audit queries
