description: "ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Saudi Arabian corporate income tax (CIT) work. Use this skill whenever asked about Saudi CIT for a resident company with non-Saudi/non-GCC shareholders, a Saudi PE of a non-resident, or a \"mixed\" entity owned partly by Saudi/GCC nationals and partly by foreigners. Trigger on phrases like \"Saudi CIT\", \"Saudi corporate income tax\", \"Saudi corporate tax\", \"ZATCA CIT 20%\", \"Saudi mixed entity\", \"Saudi PE tax\", \"Saudi Income Tax Law\", \"Royal Decree M/1\", \"Saudi non-resident tax\", \"Saudi natural gas tax\", \"Saudi hydrocarbons tax\", \"Saudi 50%/85% tax\", \"Article 21 ITL\", \"Article 12 ITL interest limitation\", \"Saudi transfer pricing\", \"Saudi Pillar Two\", \"Saudi DMTT\", \"Saudi 120 days filing\". Covers the 20% standard rate under the Income Tax Law (Royal Decree M/1 dated 15/1/1425H — 6 March 2004) and its Implementing Regulations on foreign-shareholder taxable income, the 30% natural gas rate, the tiered 50%–85% oil and other hydrocarbons rates depending on capital base, the mixed-entity Zakat/CIT split for partly Saudi/GCC-owned companies, Saudi PE attribution for non-residents, the indefinite loss carry-forward capped at 25% of annual taxable income (Article 21), the 50% of EBITDA interest deduction limitation (Article 12), the transfer-pricing Bylaws (2019) with BEPS Action 13 MF/LF/CbCR thresholds, the Pillar Two Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax track (TBC for 2025–2026 enactment), the ZATCA portal filing within 120 days of fiscal year-end, and quarterly advance CIT instalments where applicable. Out of scope: Zakat-only entities (Saudi/GCC-owned — see sa-zakat), the Real Estate Transaction Tax, withholding tax compliance detail (see sa-withholding-tax), VAT and e-invoicing (see saudi-arabia-vat and saudi-einvoice), group consolidated returns outside specific share-deal structures, special economic zones (e.g., RHQ Program 30-year exemption, ILBZ, KAEC, Ras Al-Khair, NEOM), bank/insurance specialised computational regimes beyond the rate reference, mutual funds and investment funds, and any ZATCA dispute or appellate proceedings."

| Skill version | 1.0 |

### 1.1 Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults table**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Shareholder nationality unclear | Treat as foreign (CIT applies) until Saudi/GCC nationality is documented |
| Resident-company sector unclear | Default to standard 20% (not 30% gas, not 50–85% oil); flag |
| Activity boundary unclear (e.g., upstream vs downstream hydrocarbons) | Default to standard 20% and flag for reviewer; do not apply the elevated rates without confirmation |
| Mixed-entity ownership percentages unverified | Use Commercial Registration / shareholder register as filed; do not assume |
| Loss carry-forward cap | Always apply the 25% annual cap under Article 21 |
| Interest deduction | Always apply the 50% of EBITDA cap under Article 12; track disallowed interest for carry-forward |
| TP documentation threshold | Apply CbCR/MF/LF requirements at SAR 750M group consolidated revenue; flag where uncertain |
| Pillar Two / DMTT | Mark **TBC**; do not commit to a number until enactment confirmed |
| Filing deadline | **120 days** from FYE — never assume an extension |
| Group consolidation | Treat companies as standalone unless a specific share-deal structure is documented |
| Penalty figures | Apply 5%/month capped at 25% as headline; defer specific cases to reviewer |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 2.1 Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — Full-year audited (or draft) financial statements (income statement, balance sheet, cash flow), prior-year CIT/Zakat return as filed with ZATCA, Commercial Registration (CR) showing shareholder composition with nationality breakdown, articles of association, confirmation of fiscal year-end, sector classification (standard / natural gas / hydrocarbons / banking / insurance), and any TP-relevant related-party transaction summary.

**Recommended** — General ledger, fixed-asset register with depreciation schedule, related-party transactions schedule, withholding tax credit certificates, prior-year tax-loss carry-forward schedule (with Article 21 25% cap tracking), prior-year disallowed interest carry-forward (Article 12), advance tax payment receipts, ZATCA correspondence and prior assessments.

**Ideal** — Audited statements signed by a SOCPA-registered audit firm, complete tax computation reconciling accounting profit to taxable income, Master File / Local File / CbCR where group consolidated revenue exceeds SAR 750M, shareholder register with nationality and percentages, board resolutions for material elections, and confirmation of Pillar Two / DMTT scoping if part of an in-scope MNE group.

**HARD STOP if minimum is missing.** Without financial statements, the CR with shareholder nationality breakdown, and the prior-year return, no CIT computation may be produced — the Zakat/CIT split cannot be determined.

### 2.2 Refusal Catalogue

- **R-SA-CT-1** — Saudi/GCC-only-owned entities. Companies wholly owned by Saudi or GCC nationals/entities are subject to Zakat, not CIT. Out of scope — see `sa-zakat`.  _(R-SA-CT-1)_
- **R-SA-CT-2** — Specialised sector regimes. Banking and insurance carry sector-specific computational rules beyond the rate. Out of scope except for the rate reference. Investment funds, mutual funds, and similar collective vehicles — out of scope.  _(R-SA-CT-2)_
- **R-SA-CT-3** — Group consolidated returns. Saudi tax law does not generally permit group consolidation. Specific share-deal structures may produce de facto consolidation effects — out of scope for this skill; refer to a SOCPA adviser.  _(R-SA-CT-3)_
- **R-SA-CT-4** — Special Economic Zones and incentive regimes. Includes the Regional Headquarters (RHQ) Program (30-year tax incentive package), the Integrated Logistics Bonded Zone (ILBZ), King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC), Ras Al-Khair, NEOM, and other zone-specific incentives. Out of scope — escalate to a SOCPA adviser familiar with the specific zone.  _(R-SA-CT-4)_
- **R-SA-CT-5** — Hydrocarbons upstream / oil and gas concessions. The tiered 50%–85% rates are referenced for completeness only. Actual computation involves concession-specific terms, cost-recovery mechanics, and Ministry of Energy interactions. Out of scope — escalate.  _(R-SA-CT-5)_
- **R-SA-CT-6** — Active ZATCA assessment / audit / appellate proceedings. Tax Violations and Disputes Resolution Committee (TVDRC), General Secretariat of Zakat, Tax and Customs Committees, or Court of Appeal proceedings — escalate. Do not produce numbers that pre-empt the dispute.  _(R-SA-CT-6)_
- **R-SA-CT-7** — Transfer-pricing controversy. Active APA, MAP, or controversy under the TP Bylaws — out of scope.  _(R-SA-CT-7)_
- **R-SA-CT-8** — Cross-skill scope. VAT → `saudi-arabia-vat`; e-invoicing → `saudi-einvoice`; withholding tax compliance → `sa-withholding-tax`; Zakat → `sa-zakat`; Real Estate Transaction Tax — separate skill (TBD).  _(R-SA-CT-8)_
- **R-SA-CT-9** — Pillar Two ambiguity. Where the Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) enactment status, scope, or effective date is uncertain, flag as TBC and decline to commit to a number until the gazetted instrument is verified.  _(R-SA-CT-9)_
- **R-SA-CT-10** — Tax treaty positions and PE determinations. Treaty-based PE analysis, Article 5 thresholds, treaty residency, and tie-breakers — escalate to a SOCPA adviser for any taxpayer claiming treaty relief.  _(R-SA-CT-10)_

## Section 3 — Tier 1 — Taxable Persons, Taxable Base, 20% Standard Rate

### 3.1 Taxable Persons

- **Taxable persons** — Saudi CIT applies to: 1. Non-Saudi/non-GCC shareholders of a resident company — taxed on their share of the company's taxable income (the company computes a single taxable income, then attributes the non-Saudi/GCC share to CIT and the Saudi/GCC share to Zakat — see "mixed entity" mechanics in §3.4 and §5.2). 2. Non-residents earning Saudi-source income — through a Permanent Establishment (PE) under Article 4 ITL or via specific transactional withholding regimes (see `sa-withholding-tax`). 3. Saudi PEs of non-residents — taxed on attributable income computed under Articles 4–5 ITL and Implementing Regulations. Saudi and GCC nationals are NOT subject to CIT. Their share is subject to Zakat instead (2.5% of the Zakat base — see `sa-zakat`).  _(ITL Articles 1–4 and Implementing Regulations)_

### 3.2 Standard Rate — 20%

- **Standard CIT rate** — 20% of adjusted taxable income for: the foreign-shareholder share in a resident company; Saudi PEs of non-residents; non-resident persons earning Saudi-source business income.  _(Article 7(a) ITL)_
- **CIT standard formula** — CIT = 20% × Adjusted Taxable Income (foreign-share portion or PE attributable income)  _(Article 7(a) ITL)_
- **Scope of standard rate** — This rate applies to all sectors except (i) natural gas investment (30%), (ii) oil and other hydrocarbons (tiered 50%–85%), and (iii) any specific incentive regimes (out of scope).  _(Article 7(a) ITL)_

### 3.3 Taxable Base — Adjusted Taxable Income

- **Adjusted Taxable Income formula** — Adjusted Taxable Income = Gross Income (Article 6) − Allowable Deductions (Articles 8–17) − Tax depreciation (Articles 17, declining-balance per asset class) − Loss carry-forward (Article 21, capped at 25% of annual taxable income) ± Adjustments per Implementing Regulations  _(Articles 5–6 ITL and Implementing Regulations)_

**Key adjustments**  _(Articles 5–6 ITL and Implementing Regulations)_

| Item | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Provisions and contingent expenses | Generally non-deductible unless realised |
| Related-party expenses without arm's-length pricing | Disallowed to the extent non-arm's-length (TP Bylaws) |
| Interest expense | Deductible up to **50% of EBITDA** (Article 12); excess carried forward |
| Bad debts | Deductible when written off and Article 13 conditions are met |
| Donations / charitable contributions | Deductible only if to a public-benefit entity approved by the relevant authority (Article 13(c) and Implementing Regulations) |
| Dividends paid | Not deductible |
| Income tax / Zakat paid | Not deductible |
| Withholding tax paid by the company (gross-up scenarios) | Specific Implementing-Regulation treatment — verify |
| Foreign tax | Foreign tax credit available under Article 6(c) and Implementing Regulations |

### 3.4 Mixed-Entity Computation Mechanics

- **Mixed-entity computation** — Foreign-share portion = Total Adjusted Taxable Income × (Non-Saudi/GCC ownership %) CIT                  = 20% × Foreign-share portion Saudi/GCC-share portion = Total tax base for Zakat purposes × (Saudi/GCC ownership %) Zakat                  = 2.5% × Saudi/GCC Zakat base (see sa-zakat)
- **Ownership percentage timing** — The ownership percentages are taken from the Commercial Registration (CR) as of the last day of the fiscal year (or per the Implementing Regulations where a change occurred mid-year — verify).
- **Conservative default** — Use the CR snapshot at year-end; flag any mid-year ownership changes for reviewer to apportion correctly under the Implementing Regulations.

### 3.5 Permanent Establishment (PE) — Article 4 ITL

- **Permanent Establishment** — A non-resident has a Saudi PE where it carries on business through a fixed place of business in KSA, including: a branch, office, factory, workshop, or place of management; a building site, construction or installation project (subject to the duration threshold per the ITL / applicable treaty); the provision of services in KSA (subject to the services-PE threshold per the ITL / applicable treaty); a dependent agent habitually concluding contracts in KSA on behalf of the non-resident.  _(Article 4 ITL)_
- **Treaty override** — Treaty positions override domestic-law thresholds where a treaty applies and the taxpayer claims treaty benefits. Treaty-based PE analysis is out of scope (R-SA-CT-10).  _(R-SA-CT-10)_
- **PE CIT formula** — PE CIT = 20% × Adjusted Taxable Income attributable to the PE  _(Article 5 ITL)_
- **Attribution principle** — Attribution follows the separate-enterprise principle under Article 5 and Implementing Regulations.  _(Article 5 ITL)_

### 3.6 Loss Carry-Forward — Article 21

- **Loss carry-forward formula** — Loss carry-forward = Indefinite (no time limit) Annual offset cap  = 25% of taxable income in the offset year  _(Article 21)_
- **Loss continuity** — Losses may be carried forward indefinitely but the offset against any single year's taxable income is capped at 25% of that year's taxable income. Carry-back is not available. Loss continuity requires continuity of ownership and business activity (Implementing Regulations — verify the precise tests for material ownership changes).  _(Article 21)_

### 3.7 Interest Deduction Limitation — Article 12

- **Interest deduction cap formula** — Maximum deductible interest = 50% × EBITDA EBITDA = Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (Implementing-Regulation definition)  _(Article 12)_
- **Carry-forward of disallowed interest** — Interest expense in excess of 50% of EBITDA is non-deductible in the current year and is carried forward for deduction in future years (subject to the same 50%-of-EBITDA cap in each future year). The cap applies on a per-entity basis (not consolidated) for standalone CIT computations.  _(Article 12)_
- **Conservative default** — Compute the cap each year, track the disallowed amount as a carry-forward, and never deduct prior-year disallowed interest without confirming current-year EBITDA headroom.

## Section 4 — Tier 2 — Sectoral Rates, Transfer Pricing, Pillar Two, Group Taxation

### 4.1 Natural Gas Investment — 30%

- **Natural gas investment rate** — Taxable income from natural gas investment activities is taxed at 30%. This rate covers upstream natural gas exploration, development, and production where the activity is classified as "natural gas investment" under the ITL and ZATCA guidance.  _(Article 7(b) ITL)_
- **Natural gas CIT formula** — Natural Gas CIT = 30% × Taxable income from natural gas investment activities  _(Article 7(b) ITL)_
- **Scope narrow** — Scope is narrow — verify with ZATCA / reviewer whether the activity is classified as natural gas investment or falls under standard 20% or the hydrocarbons tier. Activity boundary uncertainty defaults to 20% with a flag (do not apply elevated rates without confirmation).

### 4.2 Oil and Other Hydrocarbons — Tiered 50%–85%

**Capital Base table**  _(Article 7(c) ITL)_

| Capital Base | Indicative Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Above SAR 375 billion (largest concession holders) | **85%** |
| Mid-tier capital base | Sliding intermediate rates |
| Lower capital base (per the ITL schedule) | **50%** floor |

*(Reviewer: confirm the precise capital-base bands and intermediate rates against the current ITL text and ZATCA implementing guidance — the schedule has been updated by Royal Decrees in recent years.)*

- **Hydrocarbons CIT formula** — Hydrocarbons CIT = (Tier rate per capital base) × Taxable income from oil/other hydrocarbons  _(Article 7(c) ITL)_
- **R-SA-CT-5 reference** — Out of scope (R-SA-CT-5) — the rate is referenced only for completeness. Actual computation involves concession terms, cost recovery, and Ministry of Energy / ZATCA interactions.  _(R-SA-CT-5)_

### 4.3 Banks and Insurance — Standard Rate with Sector Specials

- **Banks and insurance treatment** — The standard 20% rate generally applies to the foreign-share portion of banks and insurance companies, but the computational base carries sector-specific rules (provisioning, technical reserves, gross premium treatment, etc.). Sector-specific computational regimes are out of scope (R-SA-CT-2) beyond the rate reference.  _(R-SA-CT-2)_

### 4.4 Group Taxation — Not Generally Available

- **Group taxation** — Saudi tax law does not generally permit group consolidated returns. Each resident entity files separately. Specific share-deal structures (mergers, demergers, share-for-share exchanges under Articles in the ITL and Implementing Regulations) may produce rollover or deferred outcomes, but these are out of scope (R-SA-CT-3) for this skill.  _(R-SA-CT-3)_

### 4.5 Transfer Pricing — TP Bylaws (2019)

- **TP Bylaws legislation** — Transfer Pricing Bylaws issued by ZATCA (then GAZT) effective 2019, aligned with OECD BEPS Action 13.  _(Transfer Pricing Bylaws (2019))_

**Documentation requirements**

| Document | Threshold | Filing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Country-by-Country Report (CbCR)** | Group consolidated revenue > SAR 750M (≈ EUR 750M / BEPS Action 13 threshold) | Annual filing by the Ultimate Parent or surrogate; KSA constituent files CbCR notification |
| **Master File** | Same SAR 750M threshold | Maintained and submitted to ZATCA upon request |
| **Local File** | KSA entity with related-party transactions above the prescribed threshold | Maintained and submitted to ZATCA upon request |
| **Disclosure Form** | All taxpayers with related-party transactions | Filed with the annual CIT return |

- **Arm's-length principle** — Arm's-length principle applies to all related-party transactions. The five OECD methods are accepted (CUP, RPM, CPM, TNMM, Profit Split). Country-by-country reporting uses the same template and exchange mechanism as the OECD CbC Standard.
- **Conservative default** — For any group exceeding SAR 750M consolidated revenue, treat MF / LF / CbCR as required and flag for reviewer. For below-threshold groups, the Disclosure Form still applies — verify.

### 4.6 Pillar Two — Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) — **TBC**

- **DMTT status** — KSA has committed to OECD Pillar Two and is expected to implement a Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (DMTT) effective 2025–2026. As of skill version 1.0 the precise enactment status, scope, and effective date are TBC — verify against the current ZATCA / Ministry of Finance instruments and the gazetted Royal Decree.
- **Conservative default** — For any MNE group with consolidated revenue ≥ EUR 750 million in at least two of the four preceding fiscal years (the Pillar Two scope threshold), flag DMTT applicability for reviewer. Do not compute a top-up amount until enactment is confirmed and the GloBE / DMTT rules are loaded into the workflow.

### 4.7 Withholding Tax — Cross-Skill Reference

- **WHT cross-reference** — WHT under Articles 68–69 ITL applies to certain payments from Saudi-resident payers to non-residents (e.g., royalties, technical services, management fees, dividends, interest, rent). Rates vary by category and treaty position. Detailed WHT compliance is out of scope — see `sa-withholding-tax`. WHT borne by the foreign-shareholder side of a mixed entity may interact with CIT credit mechanics — verify.  _(Articles 68–69 ITL)_

## Section 5 — Worked Examples

### 5.1 100% Foreign-Owned LLC — Standard 20%

**Facts:** GlobalTech Saudi LLC. Resident KSA company, **100% owned** by a non-Saudi, non-GCC parent. Fiscal year 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Dec 2025.
- Gross income (Article 6): SAR 80,000,000.
- Deductible expenses (Articles 8–17, excluding interest): SAR 50,000,000.
- Interest expense: SAR 8,000,000.
- EBITDA (per Implementing Regulations definition): SAR 38,000,000.
- Tax depreciation: SAR 4,000,000.
- Prior-year loss carry-forward (Article 21): SAR 6,000,000.

#### 5.1.1 Interest deduction limitation (Article 12).

```
Cap = 50% × EBITDA = 50% × 38,000,000 = SAR 19,000,000
Interest expense (SAR 8,000,000) ≤ Cap (SAR 19,000,000)
→ Full SAR 8,000,000 deductible. No carry-forward.
```

#### 5.1.2 Taxable income (pre-loss).

```
Gross income                       SAR 80,000,000
Less: Deductible expenses         (SAR 50,000,000)
Less: Interest (within cap)        (SAR  8,000,000)
Less: Tax depreciation             (SAR  4,000,000)
                                   ───────────────
Taxable income (pre-loss)          SAR 18,000,000
```

#### 5.1.3 Loss carry-forward (Article 21 25% cap).

```
Annual offset cap = 25% × 18,000,000 = SAR 4,500,000
Loss b/f                         = SAR 6,000,000
Loss applied this year (capped)  = SAR 4,500,000
Loss remaining for c/f           = SAR 1,500,000
```

#### 5.1.4 CIT.

```
Adjusted taxable income = 18,000,000 − 4,500,000 = SAR 13,500,000
CIT @ 20%               = 20% × 13,500,000       = SAR  2,700,000
```

#### 5.1.5 Filing.

Return due via ZATCA portal within **120 days** of 31 Dec 2025 → by **30 April 2026**. Tax payable with the return; quarterly advance instalments (Section 6.3) may have already discharged part of the liability.

### 5.2 60/40 Mixed Entity (40% Foreign, 60% Saudi/GCC)

**Facts:** Riyadh Trading Co. Resident KSA company. **60% Saudi nationals, 40% non-Saudi/non-GCC** per the CR as at 31 Dec 2025. Fiscal year 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Dec 2025.
- Adjusted taxable income (per ITL): SAR 25,000,000.
- Zakat base (per Zakat regulations — see `sa-zakat`): SAR 30,000,000.

#### 5.2.1 Foreign-share CIT.

```
Foreign-share portion = 40% × 25,000,000 = SAR 10,000,000
CIT @ 20%             = 20% × 10,000,000 = SAR  2,000,000
```

#### 5.2.2 Saudi/GCC-share Zakat (reference — see sa-zakat).

```
Saudi/GCC-share Zakat base = 60% × 30,000,000 = SAR 18,000,000
Zakat @ 2.5%               = 2.5% × 18,000,000 = SAR    450,000
```

#### 5.2.3 Total ZATCA liability.

```
CIT                          SAR 2,000,000
Zakat (cross-reference)      SAR   450,000
                             ─────────────
Total                        SAR 2,450,000
```

**Filing:** Single annual return via ZATCA portal within **120 days** of 31 Dec 2025 → by **30 April 2026**. CIT and Zakat reported on the integrated return (see Section 6).

**Reviewer note:** The Zakat base and the CIT taxable income are **not the same number** — they are computed under different rules. Always compute them independently. This example assumes the Zakat base is provided; the actual Zakat computation is delegated to `sa-zakat`.

### 5.3 Saudi PE of a Non-Resident

**Facts:** ForeignCo SARL (resident in a treaty country) operates a project office in Riyadh constituting a Saudi PE under Article 4 ITL. Fiscal year 1 Jan 2025 – 31 Dec 2025.
- Saudi-source revenue attributable to the PE: SAR 40,000,000.
- Allocable head-office expenses (under Implementing Regulations and the separate-enterprise principle): SAR 5,000,000.
- Local PE expenses (rent, salaries, depreciation): SAR 28,000,000.
- Adjusted taxable income attributable to the PE: SAR 7,000,000.

#### 5.3.1 PE CIT.

```
PE CIT = 20% × 7,000,000 = SAR 1,400,000
```

#### 5.3.2 Considerations.

- **Treaty position:** If ForeignCo's home jurisdiction has a treaty with KSA, the treaty may modify the PE threshold or the attribution rules — **out of scope (R-SA-CT-10)**, escalate to reviewer.
- **WHT interaction:** Payments to the PE by Saudi customers may be subject to WHT under Articles 68–69; WHT borne is generally creditable against the PE's CIT liability subject to the Implementing Regulations — see `sa-withholding-tax`.
- **Repatriation of branch profits:** Saudi domestic law imposes a separate WHT on branch-profit remittances — verify the current rate and whether the treaty modifies it.

**Filing:** PE files a Saudi CIT return via the ZATCA portal within **120 days** of fiscal year-end. Quarterly advance CIT instalments apply where the prior-year liability exceeds the threshold (Section 6.3).

## Section 6 — Filing and Payment Mechanics

### 6.1 Annual Return — ZATCA Portal

**Form:** Integrated annual Zakat / Income Tax / WHT return — filed electronically via the **ZATCA portal** (zatca.gov.sa). Mixed entities file a single return that splits CIT and Zakat per ownership.

**Required attachments / schedules**

| Schedule | Content |
| --- | --- |
| Main return | Computation of adjusted taxable income; CIT payable; Zakat payable for mixed entities |
| Audited financial statements | Attached |
| Schedule of related-party transactions / TP Disclosure Form | Required for all taxpayers with RPTs |
| Master File / Local File | If group consolidated revenue > SAR 750M (submitted on request) |
| CbCR notification / CbCR | If group consolidated revenue > SAR 750M |
| Schedule of loss carry-forward | Article 21 tracking with 25% annual cap applied |
| Schedule of interest carry-forward | Article 12 disallowed interest tracking |
| Schedule of WHT credits | Linked to `sa-withholding-tax` |
| Shareholder register snapshot | Nationality and ownership percentages for mixed-entity allocation |

### 6.2 Filing Deadlines

**Filing Deadlines table**

| Item | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| Annual CIT return | **Within 120 days of fiscal year-end** (e.g., FYE 31 Dec 2025 → due 30 Apr 2026) |
| Annual tax payable balance | Due with the annual return |
| Quarterly advance CIT instalment 1 | End of 6th month of the current fiscal year (verify per Implementing Regulations) |
| Quarterly advance CIT instalment 2 | End of 9th month |
| Quarterly advance CIT instalment 3 | End of 12th month |
| CbCR / Notification | Per ZATCA TP Bylaws schedule (typically aligned to BEPS Action 13 timing) |
| Extension request | Application to ZATCA; not automatic — must be filed before the deadline with justification |

*(Reviewer: confirm the advance-instalment due-date schedule against the current Implementing Regulations — historically advance instalments are tied to the 6th, 9th, and 12th months of the fiscal year, but verify.)*

### 6.3 Advance CIT Instalments

- **Advance instalments rule** — Taxpayers whose prior-year tax liability exceeded a prescribed threshold must pay three advance instalments during the current fiscal year, each generally 25% of the prior-year liability (less specified credits), with the balance due on the annual return.  _(Article 60 ITL and Implementing Regulations)_
- **Advance instalment formula** — Per-instalment amount ≈ 25% × Prior-year CIT (less applicable credits per Implementing Regulations) Balance with annual return = Current-year CIT − advance instalments − WHT credits  _(Article 60 ITL and Implementing Regulations)_
- **Reduction and conservative default** — If the taxpayer reasonably estimates that the current-year liability will be materially lower, it may apply to ZATCA to reduce the instalments — subject to default surcharge if the year-end liability exceeds the reduced basis. Conservative default: Pay on the prior-year basis unless a formal reduction is approved by ZATCA.

### 6.4 Penalties

**Penalties table**

| Infraction | Sanction |
| --- | --- |
| Late payment of tax | **5% per month** of the unpaid tax, **capped at 25%** of the unpaid amount |
| Failure to file the annual return on time | Tiered fine per ZATCA schedule (verify current amounts) |
| Failure to maintain records | Per ZATCA schedule |
| Tax evasion (intentional) | Up to **25% of the evaded tax** plus criminal exposure under the ITL penal provisions |
| Failure to file CbCR / MF / LF where required | Per TP Bylaws penalty schedule |
| Late or short advance instalment | Default surcharge per the Implementing Regulations |

- **Conservative default** — Apply 5%/month capped at 25% for late-payment scenarios and flag any other penalty interaction for reviewer to confirm against the current ZATCA penalty schedule.

### 6.5 Audit, Assessment, and Statute of Limitations

- **Audit and limitations** — - Self-assessment — the return as filed forms the basis of assessment unless ZATCA selects for audit. - Audit selection — ZATCA may select on a risk basis or by sector campaign. - Statute of limitations — generally 5 years from the filing of the return, extendable in cases of suspected concealment or fraud (verify against the current ITL / ZATCA guidance). - Disputes — Tax Violations and Disputes Resolution Committee (TVDRC) → General Secretariat of Zakat, Tax and Customs Committees → Court of Appeal. Out of scope (R-SA-CT-6) — escalate.

### 6.6 Record Retention

- **Record retention** — Retain books, records, and supporting documentation for at least 10 years from the end of the fiscal year (verify against the current ZATCA guidance and Implementing Regulations — retention may differ for specific document classes).

## Section 7 — Conservative Defaults Summary

**Conservative Defaults Summary table**

| Item | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Shareholder nationality unverified | Treat as foreign (CIT applies) |
| Sector unclear | Standard 20% (not 30% gas, not 50–85% oil) |
| Activity boundary unclear | Default 20%, flag — do not apply elevated rates |
| Mixed-entity ownership | Use CR snapshot at FYE; flag mid-year changes |
| Loss carry-forward | Indefinite, **always cap offset at 25% of annual taxable income** (Article 21) |
| Interest deduction | **Always cap at 50% of EBITDA** (Article 12); track disallowed interest c/f |
| TP documentation | Apply MF / LF / CbCR at SAR 750M consolidated revenue threshold |
| Pillar Two / DMTT | Mark **TBC**; do not compute top-up until enactment confirmed |
| Advance instalments | Pay on prior-year basis unless formal ZATCA-approved reduction |
| Filing deadline | **120 days from FYE — never assume extension** |
| Group consolidation | Standalone unless documented share-deal structure |
| Penalty headline | 5%/month, capped at 25% |
| Record retention | 10 years from FYE (verify) |
| Treaty positions / PE | Escalate; do not apply treaty relief without reviewer sign-off |
| FA / Royal-Decree change uncertain | Mark **TBC** and flag for reviewer |

**Subordinate Legislation and ZATCA Instruments**

- **Transfer Pricing Bylaws (2019)** — BEPS Action 13 aligned; MF / LF / CbCR thresholds at SAR 750M.
- **ZATCA Circulars and Guides** — including TP guide, withholding-tax guide, and sectoral guides.
- **Pillar Two / Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax instruments** — **TBC** for 2025–2026 enactment; verify the gazetted Royal Decree and ZATCA implementing rules.

**Authority and Platform**

- **Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority (ZATCA)** — zatca.gov.sa.
- **ZATCA portal** — annual return filing, advance instalments, WHT filings, TP disclosure.
- **General Secretariat of Zakat, Tax and Customs Committees** — disputes and appeals (out of scope).

**International Instruments**

- **OECD Model Tax Convention** and **KSA bilateral tax treaties** — for treaty-based PE and WHT analysis (escalate per R-SA-CT-10).
- **OECD BEPS Action 13** — Master File / Local File / Country-by-Country Reporting standard.
- **OECD Pillar Two GloBE Rules** — informing the KSA DMTT track (TBC).

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply Saudi CIT to Saudi or GCC nationals' share — that share is subject to **Zakat** (see `sa-zakat`).
- NEVER apply the standard 20% rate to taxable income from **natural gas investment** (30%) or **oil and other hydrocarbons** (tiered 50%–85%) — but equally, **do not apply elevated rates without confirmation of activity classification** (default to 20% with a flag).
- NEVER omit the **Article 21 25% annual cap** on loss carry-forward offset — losses are indefinite but cannot eliminate more than 25% of any year's taxable income.
- NEVER deduct interest in excess of **50% of EBITDA** under Article 12 — track the disallowed amount as a carry-forward.
- NEVER produce a Saudi consolidated/group return — Saudi tax law does not generally permit it (R-SA-CT-3).
- NEVER apply a Regional Headquarters (RHQ), ILBZ, NEOM, KAEC, or other zone incentive without specialist verification (R-SA-CT-4).
- NEVER assume a tax treaty modifies the PE or WHT outcome without reviewer sign-off (R-SA-CT-10).
- NEVER compute Pillar Two / DMTT amounts until the gazetted KSA instrument is verified — mark **TBC** in all interim outputs.
- NEVER apply CbCR / MF / LF thresholds inconsistently — the SAR 750M consolidated-revenue threshold is the trigger.
- NEVER advise late filing — the **120-day** deadline is strict and the penalty is **5% per month capped at 25%**.
- NEVER advise skipping or reducing advance instalments without formal ZATCA approval — default surcharge applies.
- NEVER conflate the **CIT taxable income** and the **Zakat base** in a mixed entity — they are computed under different rules.
- NEVER ignore the Commercial Registration nationality breakdown — it drives the CIT/Zakat split in a mixed entity.
- NEVER produce figures as definitive — always label as estimates pending reviewer sign-off by a SOCPA-licensed tax professional.
