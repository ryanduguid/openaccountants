## Section 2 -- General Premium (一般保險費)

### 2.1 Premium Formula

**For employees (Category 1-3):**
```
Monthly premium = Insured payroll × 5.17% × (1 + dependants) × contribution ratio

Where:
- Contribution ratio for employee = 30%
- Dependants: up to 3 can be registered under one insured person
```

**For self-employed / employers (Category 1-2):**
```
Monthly premium = Insured payroll × 5.17% × (1 + dependants) × 100%

Self-employed pays the FULL premium (no employer/government share).
```

**For union members (Category 2):**
```
Monthly premium = Insured payroll × 5.17% × (1 + dependants) × 60%
Government subsidises 40%.
```

### 2.2 Insured Payroll Bracket Table (Selected Tiers, 2025)

| Grade | Monthly Insured Payroll (NT$) | Self-Employed Premium (0 dependants) | Self-Employed Premium (1 dependant) |
|---|---|---|---|

## Section 6 -- Computation Examples

### Example 1 -- Self-Employed Freelancer, No Dependants

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Declared insured payroll | NT$45,800 (Grade 12) |
| Rate | 5.17% |
| Dependants | 0 |
| Contribution ratio | 100% |
| Monthly premium | NT$45,800 × 5.17% × 1 = **NT$2,368** |
| Annual premium | NT$2,368 × 12 = **NT$28,416** |

### Example 2 -- Self-Employed with Spouse and 1 Child

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Declared insured payroll | NT$60,800 (Grade 20) |
| Rate | 5.17% |
| Dependants | 2 (spouse + child) |
| Contribution ratio | 100% |
| Monthly premium | NT$60,800 × 5.17% × 3 = **NT$9,430** |
| Annual premium | NT$9,430 × 12 = **NT$113,160** |

### Example 3 -- Supplementary Premium on Dividends

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Dividend payment received | NT$500,000 |

| Rate | 5.17% |
| Dependants | 1 |
| Employee share (30%) | NT$60,800 × 5.17% × 2 × 30% = **NT$1,886** |
| Employer share (60%) | NT$60,800 × 5.17% × 2 × 60% = **NT$3,771** |

## Section 7 -- Edge Cases

### 7.1 Dual Status (Employee + Self-Employed)

- Must register under primary status (usually higher-income activity)
- Cannot be double-insured
- If employed AND running a business: insured through employment (Category 1-3)
- Supplementary premium still applies on non-primary income (e.g., side business, dividends)

### 7.2 New Business Registration

- Must register with NHIA within 30 days of starting business
- If previously insured via employer, transfer is automatic upon employer reporting cessation
- Gap in coverage: premiums still owed (mandatory universal coverage, no opt-out)

### 7.3 Overseas Residence

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Leaving Taiwan >6 months | May apply to suspend NHI (停保) |
| Returning from suspension | 3-month waiting period before reinstatement (or pay arrears for gap) |
| Re-entry within 6 months of suspension | Must resume NHI from re-entry date |
| Permanent departure | Cancel NHI registration; rejoin upon return to Taiwan |

### 7.4 Dependant Registration

- Up to 3 dependants can be registered under one insured person
- If >3 dependants, the 4th+ must register under another insured family member
- Dependants include: spouse, lineal ascendants/descendants, siblings under certain conditions
- Each additional dependant multiplies the premium (dependant factor)

### 7.5 Maximum Premium Cap

For self-employed at highest tier with 3 dependants:
- NT$219,500 × 5.17% × 4 = NT$45,393/month
- Annual: NT$544,716

This represents the absolute maximum NHI premium obligation.
