## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Impuesto al Salario)

The employer withholds **impuesto al salario** monthly on each employee's gross monthly remuneration, using the 5-band schedule in Decreto Ejecutivo No. 44772-H (La Gaceta No. 227, 03 Dec 2024, effective 01 Jan 2025). For an employee with a single employer this withholding is the employee's **final** tax on that employment income (*impuesto único sobre el trabajo dependiente*) — no annual return is required unless the employee has multiple employers or other income sources.

### Impuesto al Salario Brackets (2025, monthly, CRC)

Source: Decreto 44772-H, confirmed against the official UCR Oficina de Recursos Humanos *"Tabla del Impuesto al Salario 2025"*.

| Monthly gross remuneration band (₡) | Marginal rate | Tax on full band (₡) | Cumulative tax at top of band (₡) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 to 922,000 | 0% (exento) | 0 | 0 |
| over 922,000 to 1,352,000 | 10% | 43,000 | 43,000 |
| over 1,352,000 to 2,373,000 | 15% | 153,150 | 196,150 |
| over 2,373,000 to 4,745,000 | 20% | 474,400 | 670,550 |
| over 4,745,000 | 25% | (open) | (open) |

Cumulative-tax check: 0 + 43,000 + 153,150 + 474,400 = **670,550** at ₡4,745,000 (top of the 20% band). Tax above that point = 670,550 + 25% × (gross − 4,745,000).

### Computation Method

1. Take **gross monthly remuneration** (salario bruto) — the income-tax base. Per authoritative TRIBU-CR guidance, the employee's CCSS contribution (10.67%) is **NOT** deducted before applying the brackets; the base is gross. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm: at least one EOR summary implied a net-of-CCSS base; conservative default below uses GROSS.]`
2. Apply the marginal-band schedule above to obtain gross income tax.
3. Subtract any **family tax credits (créditos familiares)** the employee qualifies for (Section 2.1).
4. The result is the monthly impuesto al salario to withhold. It cannot go below zero.

### Section 2.1 -- Family Tax Credits (Créditos Familiares, 2025, monthly)

Source: Decreto 44772-H / UCR table.

| Credit | Monthly amount (₡) | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Per qualifying child (hijo) | 1,720 | Minor, or studying up to age 25, or lifelong if disabled |
| Per spouse (cónyuge) | 2,600 | One spouse only if both are taxpayers |

Credits are not available to legal entities. If both spouses are taxpayers, the spouse credit is claimed by only one of them.

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (CCSS, 2025)

Employee cuotas obrero-patronales are withheld from gross salary and remitted to CCSS via SICERE. Source: CCSS / Hacienda guidance, itemised in Officium Legal table cross-checked with EY/BDO alerts.

| Fund | Employee rate (2025) |
|---|---|
| SEM -- Seguro de Enfermedad y Maternidad (health/maternity) | 5.50% |
| IVM -- Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte (pension) | 4.17% |
| Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal | 1.00% |
| **TOTAL employee CCSS** | **10.67%** |

Sum check: 5.50 + 4.17 + 1.00 = **10.67%**. ✔

**From 01 Jan 2026:** the IVM line rises from 4.17% to 4.33%, so the employee total becomes **10.83%** (5.50 + 4.33 + 1.00). Source: BDO Costa Rica / Globalex CR / CCSS board decision.

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions (CCSS, 2025)

Employer cuotas obrero-patronales fund CCSS plus several public institutions and the Ley de Protección al Trabajador funds. Source: Officium Legal itemised table cross-checked with secondary EOR/Big-4 guides.

| Fund | Employer rate (2025) |
|---|---|
| SEM -- Seguro de Enfermedad y Maternidad | 9.25% |
| IVM -- Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte | 5.42% |
| Asignaciones Familiares (FODESAF) | 5.00% |
| INA -- Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje | 1.50% |
| FCL -- Fondo de Capitalización Laboral (Ley 7983) | 1.50% |
| ROP / pension complementaria + Banco Popular aporte patronal (grouped) | 2.00% |
| Banco Popular patronal | 0.50% |
| IMAS -- Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social | 0.50% |
| **TOTAL employer CCSS** | **26.67%** |

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm: the authoritative employer total is 26.67% (confirmed across CCSS/Hacienda/Big-4 sources), but the line-item breakdown above sums arithmetically to 25.67%. The internal allocation of the ~2.00% "ROP/pension + Banco Popular" tranche and the separate 0.50% Banco Popular patronal line is itemised differently by source, and the official CCSS rate table could not be machine-read. Use the CONFIRMED 26.67% total for cost computations; treat the per-fund split as indicative pending a Costa Rican accountant's confirmation of the exact 1.00% reconciling line.]`

**From 01 Jan 2026:** the IVM line rises from 5.42% to 5.58%, so the employer total becomes **26.83%** (only the IVM line changes). The State contribution to IVM also rises from 1.57% to 1.75%. The schedule is valid through 31 Dec 2028, with a further increase from 01 Jan 2029. Source: BDO Costa Rica / Globalex CR / CCSS 2019 board decision.

### Section 4.1 -- INS Riesgos del Trabajo (Work-Risk Insurance) -- SEPARATE

Every employer must also hold a **riesgos del trabajo** (workers' compensation) policy with INS. This is a mandatory employer cost **on top of** the 26.67% CCSS total, and is **NOT** included in it in standard breakdowns.

| Item | Employer cost |
|---|---|
| INS riesgos del trabajo | ~1.0% of payroll, risk-rated (typically ~1%–2% range) `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm: rate is set per the company's occupational risk class; ~1% is illustrative only]` |

---

## Section 5 -- Total Social-Charge Cost Summary

| Party | 2025 | From 01 Jan 2026 |
|---|---|---|
| Employee CCSS (withheld from gross) | 10.67% | 10.83% |
| Employer CCSS | 26.67% | 26.83% |
| Employer INS work-risk (separate) | ~1.0% (risk-rated) | ~1.0% (risk-rated) |
| **Approx. total employer on-cost** | **~27.67%** (26.67% + ~1% INS) | **~27.83%** (26.83% + ~1% INS) |

Only the IVM line changes between 2025 and 2026 (employer +0.16, employee +0.16). Use 2025 rates for pay periods up to 31 Dec 2025; switch to 2026 rates for pay periods on/after 01 Jan 2026.

## Section 6 -- Thresholds and Contribution Bases

| Item | Value (2025) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Income-tax-free monthly amount (employment) | ₡922,000/month | Decreto 44772-H |
| Base Mínima Contributiva (BMC) -- IVM | ₡287,360/month | EY Centroamérica / CCSS |
| Base Mínima Contributiva (BMC) -- SEM | ₡307,013/month | EY Centroamérica / CCSS |
| Reduced BMC for salaried workers (from 01 Jan 2025) | 50% of the full BMC, applies to all wage-earners regardless of age; contributions are still **reported on actual salary earned** | EY / BDS / CCSS |
| Salario base (penalty calculations) | ₡462,200 | CNPT Ley 4755 / CMFLca |

---

## Section 7 -- Minimum Wage (2025)

Costa Rica has **no single national minimum wage** — minimum wages are set **by occupation** in Decreto No. 44756-MTSS (La Gaceta No. 232, 10 Dec 2024), with a +2.37% adjustment effective 01 Jan 2025. Use the MTSS category matching the role.

| Occupational category (private sector) | Monthly minimum (₡) |
|---|---|
| Trabajador No Calificado (generic unskilled) | 367,108 |
| Semicalificado (semi-skilled) | 399,203 |
| Calificado (skilled) | 413,023 |
| Técnicos, bachiller universitario, licenciado universitario | Higher tiers per the MTSS decree `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm specific técnico/universitario figures from the MTSS table]` |

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Calculation | Sum of all ordinary + extraordinary salaries earned **01 Dec – 30 Nov**, divided by 12 |
| Payment deadline | By **20 December** |
| Tax / CCSS treatment | **Exempt** from income tax and CCSS contributions |
| Permitted deductions | Only court-ordered child support (pensión alimentaria) |

| First year | ~19.5 days of wages |
| Subsequent years | up to ~22 days per year |
| Cap | 8 years of service |

Source: Código de Trabajo.

## Section 9 -- Conservative Defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag for the reviewer:

1. **CCSS rates by pay period.** Use 2025 totals (employer **26.67%** / employee **10.67%**) for periods up to 31 Dec 2025; switch to 26.83% / 10.83% only for pay periods on/after 01 Jan 2026. Only the IVM line changes. (BDO / CCSS board)
2. **Income-tax base is GROSS.** Apply impuesto al salario brackets to gross monthly remuneration; do **not** pre-deduct employee CCSS from the income-tax base. (TRIBU-CR guidance — one EOR source disagreed; flag for confirmation.)
3. **INS is a SEPARATE employer cost.** Treat riesgos del trabajo (~1%, risk-rated) as additional to the 26.67% CCSS total, not inside it. (Standard breakdowns exclude INS.)
4. **Minimum wage is occupation-specific.** Use the MTSS decree category matching the role; never assume a single national floor. (Decreto 44756-MTSS)
5. **Use the CONFIRMED 26.67% total**, not the per-fund sum (which reconciles to 25.67% from secondary sources) when computing employer cost. (See Section 4 RESEARCH GAP.)
6. **Aguinaldo is exempt** from income tax and CCSS — never withhold on it (except court-ordered pensión alimentaria). (Código de Trabajo)

## Section 10 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Employee gross monthly remuneration (₡) | Base for both impuesto al salario and CCSS |
| Pay period date | Determines 2025 vs 2026 CCSS rates |
| Number of qualifying children + spouse-taxpayer status | Family tax credits (₡1,720/child, ₡2,600/spouse) |
| Whether employee has a single or multiple employers | Determines if monthly withholding is final |
| Occupational category | Minimum-wage compliance check |
| Company occupational risk class | INS riesgos del trabajo rate |
| Employer CCSS registration (inscripción patronal) status | Compliance / filing obligation |

### Refusal Catalogue — DO NOT proceed (refuse and request the missing item) if:

- Gross monthly remuneration is not provided or is below the applicable occupational minimum wage (flag a minimum-wage breach).
- The pay period straddles 31 Dec 2025 / 01 Jan 2026 without clarification of which rate set applies.
- The employer is not registered with CCSS (inscripción patronal) — payroll cannot be lawfully run.
- Family-credit claims are asserted without child/spouse documentation.
- A net-pay target is given and you are asked to "gross up" without confirming the income-tax base treatment (gross vs net) — flag the RESEARCH GAP.
- Aguinaldo is requested with income tax or CCSS withheld on it — refuse; it is exempt.

## Section 12 -- Worked Examples

All examples use 2025 rates, gross income-tax base, employee CCSS 10.67%, employer CCSS 26.67%. Figures recomputed end-to-end.

### Example A -- Below tax threshold, 1 child

- Gross monthly: ₡800,000. Single employer. 1 qualifying child.
- Bank line: `DEPOSITO SALARIO ABC SA ₡715,360`
- Income tax: gross ₡800,000 ≤ ₡922,000 → **₡0** (child credit cannot create a refund).
- Employee CCSS: 800,000 × 10.67% = **₡85,360**.
- **Net pay = 800,000 − 0 − 85,360 = ₡714,640.**
- Employer CCSS cost: 800,000 × 26.67% = ₡213,360 (+ ~₡8,000 INS at ~1%).

### Example B -- Mid-band, 1 child credit

- Gross monthly: ₡1,000,000. Single employer. 1 qualifying child.
- Income tax (gross base): 10% × (1,000,000 − 922,000) = 10% × 78,000 = ₡7,800.
- Less child credit ₡1,720 → income tax withheld = **₡6,080**.
- Employee CCSS: 1,000,000 × 10.67% = ₡106,700.
- **Net pay = 1,000,000 − 106,700 − 6,080 = ₡887,220.**
- Employer CCSS: 1,000,000 × 26.67% = ₡266,700 (+ ~₡10,000 INS).

### Example C -- Skilled employee, single, no credits

- Gross monthly: ₡1,500,000. Single employer. No dependants.
- Income tax: 10% × (1,352,000 − 922,000) + 15% × (1,500,000 − 1,352,000)
  = 10% × 430,000 + 15% × 148,000 = 43,000 + 22,200 = **₡65,200**.
- Employee CCSS: 1,500,000 × 10.67% = ₡160,050.
- **Net pay = 1,500,000 − 160,050 − 65,200 = ₡1,274,750.**
- Employer CCSS: 1,500,000 × 26.67% = ₡400,050.

### Example D -- Manager with spouse + 2 children

- Gross monthly: ₡3,000,000. Single employer. Spouse (claimed) + 2 qualifying children.
- Income tax: cumulative at ₡2,373,000 = ₡196,150; plus 20% × (3,000,000 − 2,373,000) = 20% × 627,000 = 125,400 → ₡321,550 before credits.
- Credits: 2,600 (spouse) + 2 × 1,720 (children) = ₡6,040 → income tax withheld = **₡315,510**.
- Employee CCSS: 3,000,000 × 10.67% = ₡320,100.
- **Net pay = 3,000,000 − 320,100 − 315,510 = ₡2,364,390.**
- Employer CCSS: 3,000,000 × 26.67% = ₡800,100.

### Example E -- High earner, top band, single

- Gross monthly: ₡5,000,000. Single employer. No dependants.
- Income tax: cumulative at ₡4,745,000 = ₡670,550; plus 25% × (5,000,000 − 4,745,000) = 25% × 255,000 = 63,750 → **₡734,300**.
- Employee CCSS: 5,000,000 × 10.67% = ₡533,500.
- **Net pay = 5,000,000 − 533,500 − 734,300 = ₡3,732,200.**
- Employer CCSS: 5,000,000 × 26.67% = ₡1,333,500.

### Example F -- Aguinaldo (13th-month)

- Employee earned ₡1,000,000/month, 12 full months 01 Dec 2024 – 30 Nov 2025.
- Aguinaldo = (sum of salaries Dec–Nov) ÷ 12 = ₡12,000,000 ÷ 12 = **₡1,000,000**.
- Tax / CCSS: **exempt**. No withholding (unless a court-ordered pensión alimentaria applies).
- Must be paid by 20 December 2025. Bank line: `AGUINALDO ₡1,000,000`.

## Section 13 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply automatically)

1. Apply the 2025 impuesto al salario schedule (0% / 10% / 15% / 20% / 25%) to **gross monthly remuneration**; band edges ₡922,000 / ₡1,352,000 / ₡2,373,000 / ₡4,745,000 (Decreto 44772-H).
2. Subtract family credits AFTER computing gross tax: ₡1,720/child, ₡2,600/spouse (one spouse only). Tax cannot go below ₡0.
3. Income tax withheld monthly is the employee's **final** tax if there is a single employer/source.
4. Withhold employee CCSS at **10.67%** of gross (2025) / **10.83%** (from 01 Jan 2026).
5. Compute employer CCSS at **26.67%** of gross (2025) / **26.83%** (from 01 Jan 2026).
6. Add the **separate** INS riesgos del trabajo employer cost (~1%, risk-rated) — never fold it into the CCSS total.
7. Aguinaldo = (salaries 01 Dec–30 Nov) ÷ 12; pay by 20 Dec; exempt from income tax and CCSS.
8. File impuesto al salario withholding via TRIBU-CR (form 137 + 207; D-138 for legal entities) within the first **15 calendar days** of the following month.
9. File the CCSS planilla via SICERE within the reporting window (≈26th of the month to the 4th business day of the next); if not filed, CCSS auto-invoices on the 5th business day with a **2% surcharge** on SEM and IVM.
10. Register the employer (inscripción patronal) and each new hire with CCSS within the first **8 business days** of starting activity / hiring.

---

## Section 14 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items require a Costa Rican accountant's judgement and are flagged rather than auto-computed:

1. **Income-tax base (gross vs net of CCSS).** Conservative default is gross; one EOR source implied net. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`
2. **Exact employer fund split.** The per-fund breakdown reconciles to 25.67% from secondary sources but the confirmed total is 26.67%; the reconciling ~1% line needs confirmation. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`
3. **INS riesgos del trabajo rate.** Risk-rated per company occupational class (~1%–2%); the company-specific rate must be obtained from INS. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`
4. **Base Mínima Contributiva application.** Whether the 50% reduced BMC (from 01 Jan 2025) affects a specific low-wage or part-time worker's contributory floor — contributions are still reported on actual salary earned.
5. **Multi-employer reconciliation.** If the employee has more than one employer/source, an annual reconciliation may be required — outside monthly withholding.
6. **Specialised minimum-wage tiers** (técnico / universitario) and sector-specific arrangements.
7. **Cesantía exact day-count** within the ~19.5–22 days/year sliding scale and the 8-year cap for a specific tenure.
8. **Self-employed (actividad lucrativa) annual brackets** — out of scope for employer payroll; the live PwC page now renders 2026 figures and 2025 self-employed figures were not separately confirmed. `[RESEARCH GAP — out of scope]`

## Section 17 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you cannot identify the correct figures for a specific employee or period:

1. Confirm the **pay-period date** to select 2025 vs 2026 CCSS rates.
2. Confirm **single vs multiple employers** to decide if monthly withholding is final.
3. If the employer's **CCSS registration** status is unknown, treat the engagement as blocked until inscripción patronal is confirmed.
4. If the **INS risk class** is unknown, use ~1% as an illustrative placeholder and flag it as `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`.
5. If the **income-tax base treatment** is contested, default to **gross** and flag for the Costa Rican accountant.
6. Always present output as **estimated** and route to a Contador Público Autorizado for sign-off.

## Section 20 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (impuesto al salario + CCSS) | **This skill (costa-rica-payroll.md)** |
| Corporate income tax | costa-rica-corporate-tax.md (if available) |
| VAT (IVA) returns | costa-rica-vat-return.md (if available) |
| Bookkeeping | costa-rica-bookkeeping.md (if available) |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages, employer CCSS, and INS work-risk are expenses; employee CCSS and impuesto al salario withheld are liabilities until remitted to CCSS/Hacienda.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** Single-employer monthly withholding is final; multi-source employees need annual reconciliation.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER run payroll for an employer that is not registered with CCSS (inscripción patronal).
- NEVER fold the INS riesgos del trabajo cost into the 26.67% CCSS total — it is a separate employer policy.
- NEVER pre-deduct employee CCSS from the income-tax base without flagging (conservative default = GROSS base).
- NEVER withhold income tax or CCSS on aguinaldo — it is exempt (only court-ordered pensión alimentaria may be deducted).
- NEVER use 2026 CCSS rates (26.83% / 10.83%) for pay periods before 01 Jan 2026, or 2025 rates after.
- NEVER assume a single national minimum wage — use the MTSS occupation-specific figure.
- NEVER let family credits create a negative income-tax (refund) — floor the withholding at ₡0.
- NEVER miss the TRIBU-CR 15-calendar-day or CCSS planilla deadlines — surcharges and penalties apply.
- NEVER present the per-fund employer breakdown as exact — the confirmed total is 26.67%; the line split is a `[RESEARCH GAP]`.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Costa Rican Contador Público Autorizado.
