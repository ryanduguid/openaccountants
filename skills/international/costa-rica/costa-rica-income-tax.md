# Costa Rica Income Tax -- Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified).** Figures below are drawn from Big-4 / law-firm summaries (PwC, BDO, García & Bodán, EY, ICS), reputable payroll guides, the CCSS contribution scale, and reporting of the 2026 decrees. Several rates trace to secondary reporting of Decreto Ejecutivo 45333-H and the CCSS scale rather than a directly-fetched primary government page. Every figure with weak provenance or a known reconciliation issue carries an explicit **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** marker. A licensed Costa Rican contador público autorizado (CPA) must sign off before filing.

### Tax Rate Brackets

Costa Rica runs **two parallel labor-income schedules**: salaried employees are taxed on **monthly** brackets (final withholding by the employer), while the self-employed / persons with profit-generating activity are taxed on **annual** brackets. Both run 0/10/15/20/25%. (PwC; Decreto 45333-H via García & Bodán / BDO.)

**Self-Employed / Profit-Generating Activity — Annual (impuesto a las utilidades, 2026)**
*Basis: annual net income after the 25% standard deduction OR documented expenses (Decreto 45333-H; García & Bodán; Tico Times).*

| Annual Net Income (₡) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 6,244,000 | 0% (exempt) | ₡0 |
| 6,244,000 -- 8,329,000 | 10% | ₡208,500 |
| 8,329,000 -- 10,414,000 | 15% | ₡521,250 |
| 10,414,000 -- 20,872,000 | 20% | ₡2,612,850 |
| over 20,872,000 | 25% | -- |

*Cumulative check: band 2 = 2,085,000 × 10% = 208,500; band 3 = 2,085,000 × 15% = 312,750 (→521,250); band 4 = 10,458,000 × 20% = 2,091,600 (→2,612,850).*

**Salaried Employees — Monthly (renta del trabajo dependiente, 2026)**
*Basis: monthly gross employment income; this is a FINAL withholding tax (Decreto 45333-H via García & Bodán; PwC).*

| Monthly Gross (₡) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 918,000 | 0% | ₡0 |
| 918,000 -- 1,347,000 | 10% | ₡42,900 |
| 1,347,000 -- 2,364,000 | 15% | ₡195,450 |
| 2,364,000 -- 4,727,000 | 20% | ₡668,050 |
| over 4,727,000 | 25% | -- |

*Cumulative check: band 2 = 429,000 × 10% = 42,900; band 3 = 1,017,000 × 15% = 152,550 (→195,450); band 4 = 2,363,000 × 20% = 472,600 (→668,050).*

**Self-Employed — Annual (PRIOR period 2025, governs FY2025 returns filed in 2026)**
*(PwC; Decreto 44772-H.)*

| Annual Net Income (₡) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 4,094,000 | 0% | ₡0 |
| 4,094,000 -- 6,115,000 | 10% | ₡202,100 |
| 6,115,000 -- 10,200,000 | 15% | ₡814,850 |
| 10,200,000 -- 20,442,000 | 20% | ₡2,863,250 |
| over 20,442,000 | 25% | -- |

*Cumulative check: band 2 = 2,021,000 × 10% = 202,100; band 3 = 4,085,000 × 15% = 612,750 (→814,850); band 4 = 10,242,000 × 20% = 2,048,400 (→2,863,250).*

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The 2026 salaried (₡918k/1,347k/2,364k/4,727k) and self-employed (₡6,244k/8,329k/10,414k/20,872k) thresholds come from García & Bodán / BDO / ICS / Tico Times reporting of **Decreto Ejecutivo 45333-H** (published in La Gaceta 5 Dec 2025; in force 1 Jan 2026), not the decree text in La Gaceta. Note: 2026 brackets were reindexed by a **-0.38% CPI deflation** vs 2025 (García & Bodán; ICS), so some thresholds nudged DOWN — e.g. the self-employed top-rate floor fell from ₡20,442,000 (2025) to ₡20,872,000 only in *nominal* terms because of the prior-year reform; confirm direction band-by-band against La Gaceta. **Caution on PwC:** as of the date of writing, PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries still shows the **2025** self-employed schedule (0 / ₡4,094,000 / ₡6,115,000 / ₡10,200,000 / ₡20,442,000) under a "2026" heading — do NOT rely on the PwC page for the current self-employed thresholds; use the Decreto 45333-H figures above. Verify against La Gaceta before filing.

### Schedular & Withholding Rates (separate from labor income)

| Item | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Capital income — movable & immovable (rentas de capital, Ley 9635) | 15% | PwC |
| Dividends | 15% (lower in limited cases) | PwC |
| Capital gains | 15% (one-time 2.25% election for assets acquired before 1 Jul 2019) | PwC |
| VAT (IVA) standard rate | 13% (reduced 4% / 2% / 1%) | Fonoa; PwC |
| Non-resident remittances (remesas al exterior) | 8.5%–30% by income type (≈10% professional fees, 15% dividends, 25% salaries/pensions) | PwC |

### Family Tax Credits (2026, against computed income tax)

| Credit | Monthly | Annual | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Per child | ₡1,710 | ₡20,520 | García & Bodán; BDO (Decreto 45333-H) |
| Spouse | ₡2,590 | ₡31,080 | García & Bodán; BDO (Decreto 45333-H) |

*Annual figures are the authoritative ones (García & Bodán; BDO both give per-child ₡20,520/yr and spouse ₡31,080/yr). The monthly spouse figure reconciles as ₡31,080 ÷ 12 = ₡2,590 exactly; some secondary sources (e.g. PwC reporting) round this to ₡2,600 — use ₡2,590 for monthly withholding to stay consistent with the annual ₡31,080. Per-child monthly ₡20,520 ÷ 12 = ₡1,710 ✓.*

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Self-employed expense basis | 25% standard deduction (Law 10667) unless documented receipts clearly exceed 25% of gross — take whichever is greater |
| Income type (salaried vs self-employed) | STOP — schedule and brackets differ entirely |
| Self-employed CCSS income category | Confirm category from the CCSS Escala Contributiva; never below the minimum contributory base (BMC) |
| Source of income | Costa Rica-source only (territorial); foreign-source income generally not taxed |
| Filing platform | TRIBU-CR (ATV decommissioned 4 Aug 2025) |
| Pure salary earner — annual return | None required; monthly withholding is final |
| Unknown family-credit eligibility | Claim ₡0 until dependants confirmed |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text), plus confirmation of income type (salaried vs self-employed / profit-generating activity) and the fiscal year being filed.

**Recommended** -- sales/electronic invoices (TicoFactura / comprobantes electrónicos), purchase invoices/receipts, CCSS contribution records, prior-year D-101 or assessment, VAT (IVA) registration status, RTS (simplified regime) status, dependants for family credits.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, partial-payment (pago parcial) confirmations, RUT/D-140 registration detail, capital-income statements.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This D-101 was produced from the bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that the 25%-deduction vs documented-expense election is correct and that all income shown is Costa Rica-source."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-CR-1 -- Income type unknown.** "Costa Rica taxes salaried income on MONTHLY brackets (final withholding) and self-employed income on ANNUAL brackets. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the income type. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-CR-2 -- Companies / legal entities (personas jurídicas).** "While entities also file the D-101, corporate income tax (different deductions, minimum-tax and book-tax rules) is out of scope here. Escalate to a contador público autorizado."

**R-CR-3 -- Foreign-source income.** "Costa Rica uses a territorial system — only Costa Rica-source income is taxable. Classifying whether income is CR-source can be complex (digital services, cross-border contracts). Escalate to a contador público autorizado."

**R-CR-4 -- Capital gains / capital income / property disposals.** "Capital income and capital gains are a separate schedular tax under Ley 9635 (15%, with a one-time 2.25% election). Out of scope. Escalate to a contador público autorizado."

**R-CR-5 -- Arrears / TRIBU-CR migration issues.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears, uncorrected legacy ATV obligations, or is subject to DGT enforcement. Late-payment charges (1%/month plus statutory interest) and migration penalties are material. Do not advise. Escalate to a contador público autorizado immediately."

**R-CR-6 -- VAT (IVA) return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (D-101) only. For Costa Rica VAT (D-104), use the dedicated VAT skill."

**R-CR-7 -- CCSS exact contributory category unknown.** "Self-employed CCSS is progressive by income category and subject to a minimum contributory base (BMC). Do not state a precise CCSS amount until the category is confirmed against the CCSS Escala Contributiva."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement (Spanish terms are common). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. Amounts are in ₡ unless a foreign currency is shown.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (IVA-registered)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2026 ; BCR TRANSFERENCIA ENTRANTE ; ESTUDIO KREBS S.A. ; PAGO FACTURA FE-2026-003 ; +1,130,000.00 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:**
Client payment for services. Client is IVA-registered, so ₡1,130,000 includes 13% IVA. Net = 1,130,000 / 1.13 = ₡1,000,000 (gross income). The ₡130,000 is IVA collected — excluded from income (it is a liability to Hacienda).

**Classification:** Gross income = ₡1,000,000. IVA ₡130,000 excluded.

### Example 2 -- 25% Standard Deduction vs Documented Expenses (Law 10667)

**Input:** Self-employed consultant, FY2026. Gross income ₡18,000,000. Documented allowable expenses on file = ₡3,600,000.

**Reasoning (Law 10667, eff. 1 Jan 2026):** The self-employed may deduct the **greater** of (a) 25% of gross = 18,000,000 × 25% = ₡4,500,000, or (b) documented expenses = ₡3,600,000. The 25% flat deduction is greater, so use ₡4,500,000.

**Net income = 18,000,000 − 4,500,000 = ₡13,500,000.**

**Classification:** Use the 25% standard deduction. Net income ₡13,500,000 → carried to the bracket engine (see Example 4).

### Example 3 -- Salaried Employee Monthly Withholding (2026)

**Input:** Employee, monthly gross salary ₡2,000,000.

**Reasoning (monthly brackets):**
- 0 – 918,000 @ 0% = ₡0
- 918,000 – 1,347,000 @ 10% = 429,000 × 10% = ₡42,900
- 1,347,000 – 2,000,000 @ 15% = 653,000 × 15% = ₡97,950
- **Monthly income tax withheld = 42,900 + 97,950 = ₡140,850.**

CCSS employee deduction (2026, 10.83%) = 2,000,000 × 10.83% = ₡216,600.

**Net pay ≈ 2,000,000 − 140,850 − 216,600 = ₡1,642,550.** This is a **final** tax — no D-101 required for a pure salary earner.

**Classification:** Final monthly withholding ₡140,850; no annual return.

### Example 4 -- Self-Employed Annual Tax (2026)

**Input:** Net income (after 25% deduction) = ₡13,500,000 (from Example 2).

**Reasoning (annual brackets):**
- 0 – 6,244,000 @ 0% = ₡0
- 6,244,000 – 8,329,000 @ 10% = 2,085,000 × 10% = ₡208,500
- 8,329,000 – 10,414,000 @ 15% = 2,085,000 × 15% = ₡312,750
- 10,414,000 – 13,500,000 @ 20% = 3,086,000 × 20% = ₡617,200
- **Income tax before credits = 208,500 + 312,750 + 617,200 = ₡1,138,450.**

Less family credits if applicable (e.g. 2 children = 2 × ₡20,520 = ₡41,040).
**Tax after credits (2 children) = 1,138,450 − 41,040 = ₡1,097,410.**

**Classification:** D-101 tax before credits ₡1,138,450; ₡1,097,410 after a 2-child credit.

### Example 5 -- Self-Employed CCSS (progressive)

**Input line:**
`05/02/2026 ; BNCR DEBITO ; CCSS CUOTA TRABAJADOR INDEPENDIENTE ; ENERO 2026 ; -450,000.00 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:**
Self-employed CCSS is progressive by income category (combined affiliate SALUD + IVM ≈ 6.89%–18.95% of declared income, 2025 scale), subject to the minimum contributory base (BMC). It is a mandatory cost of the activity, NOT a Hacienda income-tax payment. Confirm the exact category from the CCSS Escala Contributiva before stating any precise rate.

**Classification:** CCSS contribution — deductible cost of activity (if documented-expense election); confirm category. NOT an income-tax credit.

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`20/05/2026 ; BAC TRANSFERENCIA ; CUENTA PROPIA - AHORROS ; ; -2,000,000.00 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Territorial Basis

**Legislation:** Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta No. 7092.
Only Costa Rica-source income is taxable, irrespective of nationality or residency. Foreign-source income of residents is generally exempt. (PwC.) If income source is ambiguous, STOP and escalate (R-CR-3).

### 5.2 Two Parallel Labor Schedules

| Income type | Schedule | 2026 exemption | Final? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salaried (renta del trabajo dependiente) | Monthly brackets 0/10/15/20/25% | ₡918,000/month | Yes — employer withholding is final (PwC) |
| Self-employed / utilidades | Annual brackets 0/10/15/20/25% | ₡6,244,000/year | No — annual D-101 required |

### 5.3 Law 10667 — 25% Standard Deduction (eff. 1 Jan 2026)

The self-employed may deduct a flat **25% of GROSS income without receipts**, OR claim **documented actual expenses** — **whichever yields the greater deduction** (per-taxpayer election). Applies to professionals, technicians, personal-service providers, sales/commission and insurance agents working without an employment relationship. (Tico Times; Ley 10667.)

### 5.4 Revenue Recognition

All Costa Rica-source business income is gross income. For IVA-registered taxpayers, report net of the 13% IVA collected. IVA collected on sales is NOT income — it is a liability to Hacienda.

### 5.5 Family Tax Credits (2026)

Per child ₡1,710/month (₡20,520/yr); spouse ₡2,590/month (₡31,080/yr). Applied against computed income tax. (García & Bodán; BDO — Decreto 45333-H. Monthly spouse = ₡31,080 ÷ 12 = ₡2,590; some secondary sources round to ₡2,600.)

### 5.6 CCSS — Employee and Employer (salaried)

| Class | Year | Rate | Breakdown | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employee total (cuota obrera) | 2025 | **10.67%** | SEM 5.50% + IVM 4.17% + Banco Popular 1.00% | CRIE; BDO; BLP |
| Employee total (cuota obrera) | 2026 | **10.83%** | SEM 5.50% + IVM 4.33% + Banco Popular 1.00% | BDO |
| Employer (cargas sociales, incl. INS riesgos) | 2025 | **26.67%** | see breakdown below | La Nación; BDO; AG Legal |
| Employer (cargas sociales, incl. INS riesgos) | 2026 | **26.83%** | IVM rises 5.42%→5.58% (+0.16pp) | La Nación; BDO; AG Legal |

*Employee column checks: 2025 = 5.50 + 4.17 + 1.00 = 10.67% ✓. 2026 = 5.50 + 4.33 + 1.00 = 10.83% ✓. No salary ceiling.*

**Employer breakdown (2026):** SEM/health 9.25% + IVM/pension 5.58% + FODESAF (Asignaciones Familiares) 5.00% + INA 1.50% + FCL (Fondo de Capitalización Laboral, Ley 7983) 1.50% + ROP/OPC (Operadora de Pensiones Complementarias) 2.00% + IMAS 0.50% + Banco Popular patrono 0.50% (0.25% recaudación + 0.25% protección al trabajador) + INS Riesgos del Trabajo (workers' comp) 1.00% = **26.83%**. (La Nación 2026 CCSS cargas-sociales table.)

*Employer column check (2026): 9.25 + 5.58 + 5.00 + 1.50 + 1.50 + 2.00 + 0.50 + 0.50 + 1.00 = 26.83% ✓. For 2025, IVM is 5.42% (not 5.58%), so the total is 26.83 − 0.16 = 26.67% ✓.

### 5.7 CCSS — Self-Employed (trabajador independiente)

Self-employed CCSS is **progressive by income category**, not flat, and is subject to a **minimum contributory base (BMC)**. (2025 scale, CCSS Escala Contributiva AV-TI Enero 2025, E-GF-USIN-030.)

| Category | Affiliate SALUD share | Affiliate IVM share | Combined affiliate burden |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cat 1 (lowest) | 2.89% | 4.00% | ≈6.89% |
| Cat 2 | 4.33% | 5.49% | ≈9.82% |
| Cat 3 | 6.24% | 7.37% | ≈13.61% |
| Cat 4 | 8.02% | 7.82% | ≈15.84% |
| Cat 5 (highest) | 10.69% | 8.26% | ≈18.95% |

*The state tops up SALUD so each category totals 12.00%; the state + LPT (Art. 78 Ley de Protección al Trabajador) top up IVM so each category totals 9.59%. Self-employed pay MORE than salaried employees — upheld by the Sala IV (Constitutional Chamber, 19 Feb 2025). (CCSS scale; ICS; Delfino.)*

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** This is the **2025** CCSS scale. A 2026-updated scale likely exists following the Jan-2026 minimum-wage and IVM changes. The exact colón **minimum contributory base (BMC)** for 2025/2026 was not isolated from a CCSS authority page in research. Pull the current scale and BMC before quoting a precise contribution.

### 5.8 VAT (IVA) Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| IVA collected on sales | NOT income — exclude from gross |
| Input IVA recovered | NOT an expense — exclude |
| Input IVA blocked / non-recoverable | IS an expense (documented-expense election) |
| Non-recoverable foreign VAT | IS an expense — full gross is cost |

IVA standard rate 13% (reduced 4%/2%/1%); **no registration threshold** — registration required for any habitual or incidental sale of goods/services. (Fonoa; PwC.)

### 5.9 Régimen de Tributación Simplificada (RTS)

Small taxpayers — annual purchases ≤ **186 base salaries ≈ ₡85,969,200** (IVA-incl., 2026 simplified-regime base) and ≤ 5 employees excl. owner (Ley 10512/2024) — pay a **fixed quarterly fee covering BOTH VAT and income tax** via form **D-105**. (Alegra; Finube.) If a client qualifies for and uses RTS, the progressive brackets above do not apply — flag for reviewer.

### 5.10 Partial Payments (Pagos Parciales / Anticipos)

Self-employed/businesses pay advance income-tax instalments during the year (form **D-103**), credited against the D-101. Typically quarterly. (PwC; ICS.) Not an expense — a credit against the final liability.

### 5.11 Filing Deadlines and Forms

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Via |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-101 | Annual income tax return (self-employed/individuals/entities, traditional regime) | 15 March of following year (2 months 15 days after FY close); for FY2025 the statutory 15 March 2026 is a Sunday, so Hacienda's calendar (CP-11-2026) sets the due date as Mon 16 March 2026 | TRIBU-CR |
| D-103 | Partial payments / anticipos | Quarterly | TRIBU-CR |
| D-104 | Monthly VAT (IVA) return | Within first 15 calendar days of following month | TRIBU-CR |
| D-105 | Régimen Simplificado (VAT + income tax) | Quarterly (within 15 days after quarter-end) | TRIBU-CR |
| D-151 | Annual informative return (clients/suppliers/expenses) | Generally late February for prior calendar year | TRIBU-CR |
| D-140 / RUT | Taxpayer registration before commencing activity | Before starting activity (≤10 business days) | TRIBU-CR |

*(Hacienda; Alegra; PwC. All persons doing lucrative activity must file the D-101 even with zero income.)*

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** D-104 monthly, D-151 February, and D-103 quarterly schedules are standard but TRIBU-CR (live since 4 Aug 2025) may have restated form codes/calendars. Confirm on the TRIBU-CR portal.

### 5.12 Penalties (Código de Normas y Procedimientos Tributarios No. 4755)

**Base salary (salario base) reference 2026 = ₡462,200** (unchanged from 2025; Consejo Superior del Poder Judicial, Circular 246-2025). All base-salary-denominated fines compute from this. (EY; Globalex.)

| Infraction | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Failure to register (Art. 78) | 0.5 base salary/month (≈₡231,100), max 3 base salaries (cap ₡1,386,600) | CNPT 4755; Hacienda |
| Late/omitted self-assessed return (Art. 79) | 0.5 base salary = ₡231,100 (reducible under Art. 88 if voluntary) | CNPT; EY |
| Failure to supply information (Art. 83) | 2% of prior-period gross income, min 3 / max 100 base salaries | CNPT 4755 |
| Late payment (morosidad, Art. 80/80 bis) | 1%/month of unpaid tax (capped) + statutory interest (DGT, revised semi-annually) | CNPT; Osa Property Mgmt |
| TRIBU-CR migration — uncorrected ATV obligations | Administrative penalties ≈ US$110–US$2,600/month of delay | EY; Tactic |

*Check: 0.5 × ₡462,200 = ₡231,100 ✓; 3 × ₡462,200 = ₡1,386,600 ✓.*

### 5.13 Aguinaldo (13th-Month Pay)

Mandatory year-end bonus ≈ 1/12 of annual earnings (Dec–Nov), payable **by 20 December**, exempt from income tax and CCSS. (Labor Code; payroll guides.)

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 25% Standard Deduction vs Documented Expenses

- Compute both: 25% of gross vs total documented allowable expenses. Use the greater (Law 10667).
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm documentation supports the actual-expense figure if that route is taken, and that the election is applied consistently.

### 6.2 Home Office Apportionment

- Apportion electricity (ICE/CNFL), water (AYA), internet (Kolbi/Liberty), rent by business-use proportion.
- Must be a dedicated workspace.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until reviewer confirms the arrangement (and only relevant under the documented-expense election).

### 6.3 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance is deductible; requires a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a log is provided.

### 6.4 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; client provides a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until confirmed.

### 6.5 Self-Employed CCSS Category & BMC

- The combined affiliate burden ranges ≈6.89%–18.95% by income category, never below the minimum contributory base.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the exact category and the current-year BMC against the CCSS scale before quoting a contribution figure.

### 6.6 Income Source (Territorial Test)

- Digital/cross-border income may or may not be Costa Rica-source.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm CR-source classification for any platform/foreign-client income.

### 6.7 RTS Eligibility

- ≤186 base salaries in annual purchases and ≤5 employees — confirm eligibility and whether the fixed-fee regime is more favourable than the traditional D-101.
- **Flag for reviewer.**

### 6.8 Capital Income vs Business Income

- Rental, interest, dividends may fall under the separate 15% capital-income schedule rather than utilidades.
- **Flag for reviewer** to confirm the correct schedule.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Self-employed, 25% deduction, mid income (2026).**
Input: Gross ₡18,000,000; documented expenses ₡3,600,000; no dependants.
Expected: deduction = max(4,500,000, 3,600,000) = ₡4,500,000. Net = ₡13,500,000. Tax = 208,500 + 312,750 + (3,086,000 × 20% = 617,200) = **₡1,138,450**.

**Test 2 -- Self-employed below exemption (2026).**
Input: Gross ₡7,000,000; 25% deduction = ₡1,750,000; net = ₡5,250,000.
Expected: ₡5,250,000 < ₡6,244,000 → **₡0 tax** (still must file the D-101).

**Test 3 -- Salaried monthly withholding (2026).**
Input: Monthly gross ₡2,000,000.
Expected: 42,900 + (653,000 × 15% = 97,950) = **₡140,850/month**, final tax; CCSS employee 10.83% = ₡216,600; net ≈ ₡1,642,550. No D-101.

**Test 4 -- Documented expenses beat 25% (2026).**
Input: Gross ₡20,000,000; documented expenses ₡7,000,000 (> 25% = ₡5,000,000).
Expected: use ₡7,000,000. Net = ₡13,000,000. Tax = 208,500 + 312,750 + (2,586,000 × 20% = 517,200) = **₡1,038,450**.

**Test 5 -- Family credit applied.**
Input: Net income ₡13,500,000 (Test 1), 2 children + spouse.
Expected: credit = (2 × 20,520) + 31,080 = ₡72,120. Tax after credits = 1,138,450 − 72,120 = **₡1,066,330**.

**Test 6 -- Top bracket (2026).**
Input: Net income ₡25,000,000.
Expected: cumulative to ₡20,872,000 = ₡2,612,850; plus (4,128,000 × 25% = 1,032,000) = **₡3,644,850**.

**Test 7 -- 2025 self-employed (FY2025 return filed in 2026).**
Input: Net income ₡12,000,000 on 2025 brackets.
Expected: cumulative to ₡10,200,000 = ₡814,850; plus (1,800,000 × 20% = 360,000) = **₡1,174,850**.

**Test 8 -- Late return penalty.**
Input: Self-assessed D-101 filed late (Art. 79).
Expected: 0.5 × ₡462,200 = **₡231,100** (reducible under Art. 88 if voluntary), plus 1%/month + interest on any unpaid tax.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the annual brackets to salaried income or the monthly brackets to self-employed income — the schedules are separate.
- NEVER compute the bracket tax figures by hand for delivery — pass net income to the deterministic engine; the worked figures here are for validation only.
- NEVER tax foreign-source income — Costa Rica is territorial; escalate if source is unclear.
- NEVER include IVA collected on sales in gross income.
- NEVER state a precise self-employed CCSS amount without confirming the income category and the minimum contributory base (BMC) against the CCSS scale.
- NEVER itemise individual expenses when the 25% standard deduction is elected.
- NEVER treat partial payments (D-103) or income tax itself as a deductible expense.
- NEVER quote the 2025 CCSS scale as if it is the confirmed 2026 scale — flag the gap.
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, or personal/living costs as deductions.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pending CPA review.
