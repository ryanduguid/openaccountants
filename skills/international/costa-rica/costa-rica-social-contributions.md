  Use this skill whenever asked about Costa Rica social-security / payroll contributions ("cargas sociales") to the CCSS and the related employment-income withholding. Trigger on phrases like "how much CCSS do I pay", "cargas sociales Costa Rica", "CCSS employer cost", "patrono CCSS", "cuota obrero-patronal", "IVM contribution", "SEM CCSS", "planilla CCSS", "Banco Popular deduction", "FODESAF", "INA exemption", "deducciones de planilla", "retención del impuesto al trabajo dependiente", "Costa Rica payroll tax", "social charges 2025/2026", "trabajador independiente CCSS", or any question about Costa Rican employer/employee social contributions, the monthly salary-tax withholding, the minimum contribution base (BMC), or net-pay computation. Also trigger when classifying bank-statement lines that relate to CCSS planilla debits, SICERE payments, INS riesgos-del-trabajo premiums, Banco Popular debits, or D-103 withholding remittances on BAC, BN, BCR, Davivienda, or other Costa Rican bank statements. This skill covers the SEM and IVM rates (including the confirmed 1 Jan 2026 IVM increase), FODESAF/IMAS/INA/FCL/ROP/Banco Popular components, the INS work-risk premium, employer and employee totals, the BMC floor, the monthly progressive salary-tax brackets, family tax credits, aguinaldo treatment, minimum wage, forms D-103/D-101/D-151, the CCSS planilla cycle, bank-statement classification patterns, and edge cases. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Costa Rican payroll / social-contribution work.

# Costa Rica Social-Security Contributions (Cargas Sociales) & Salary-Tax Withholding — Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 (research-verified). Confidence: medium.** Several primary authority PDFs (Hacienda CP-103-2024, live CCSS pages, BDO/BLP, OECD) returned HTTP errors during research, so figures were corroborated from multiple secondary tax/legal sources (PwC, BDO, La Nación, EY, BLP, siemprealdía) rather than read off every authority page. Every figure carries an inline citation or an explicit `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` marker. A Costa Rican CPA / contador público autorizado must sign off before any output is filed or relied upon.

## Section 1 — Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

**Component overview (2025, % of gross salary):**

| Fund | Employer | Employee | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| CCSS SEM (Seguro de Enfermedad y Maternidad — health & maternity) | 9.25% | 5.50% | siemprealdía, CCSS |
| CCSS IVM (Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte — pension) | 5.42% | 4.17% | La Nación, BDO, EY, siemprealdía |
| FODESAF / Asignaciones Familiares (family allowances) | 5.00% | 0% | siemprealdía |
| IMAS (Instituto Mixto de Ayuda Social) | 0.50% | 0% | siemprealdía |
| INA (Instituto Nacional de Aprendizaje — vocational training) | 1.50% | 0% | siemprealdía (exempt for some employers — see Rule 6) |
| Banco Popular y de Desarrollo Comunal | 0.50% | 1.00% | siemprealdía |
| FCL — Fondo de Capitalización Laboral (LPT) | 1.50% | 0% | siemprealdía, LPT |

| **TOTAL (2025)** | **≈26.67%** | **≈10.67%** | siemprealdía, La Nación, BDO |

Employer component arithmetic (2025): 9.25 + 5.42 + 5.00 + 0.50 + 1.50 + 0.50 + 1.50 + 2.00 = 25.67%, plus INS ~1.00% = **26.67%**. Employee: 5.50 + 4.17 + 1.00 = **10.67%**. (Both totals reconcile to the official figures cited above.)

**2026 changes (effective 1 Jan 2026):**

| Fund | Employer 2025 → 2026 | Employee 2025 → 2026 | State 2025 → 2026 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CCSS IVM | 5.42% → 5.58% (+0.16pp) | 4.17% → 4.33% (+0.16pp) | 1.57% → 1.75% | CCSS noticia, La Nación, BDO, EY |
| All other funds | unchanged | unchanged | — | siemprealdía |
| **TOTAL** | **≈26.67% → ≈26.83%** | **≈10.67% → ≈10.83%** | — | BDO, La Nación |

IVM increase is +0.16pp on each of employer and employee, effective 1 Jan 2026 through 31 Dec 2028; worker IVM share is scheduled to keep rising toward a target ~12.16% total IVM by 2029 (La Nación, EY). 2026 employer: 25.67 − 5.42 + 5.58 = 25.83% + INS 1.00% = **26.83%**. 2026 employee: 5.50 + 4.33 + 1.00 = **10.83%**.

## Section 1A — Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Employer total social charge | Use 26.67% of gross for 2025 / 26.83% from 1 Jan 2026; treat INS work-risk as ~1% referential and flag that the real rate is set by the occupational risk class (siemprealdía, BDO) |
| Employee total deduction | 10.67% of gross for 2025 / 10.83% from 1 Jan 2026 (SEM 5.50% + IVM 4.17%/4.33% + Banco Popular 1.00%) |
| Low-wage contribution base | If gross salary is below the CCSS BMC (≈₡333,328 SEM / ≈₡311,990 IVM for 2025), compute contributions on the BMC, not the actual lower salary (CCSS BMC data) |
| Aguinaldo (13th-month) | Exclude from BOTH CCSS social charges and income tax (PwC, MTSS) |
| Unknown which year applies | Ask the period; if the payroll month is on/after Jan 2026, use the 2026 IVM rates |
| Unknown employer size (INA exemption) | Assume INA 1.50% APPLIES (do not drop it) until headcount is confirmed (BDO) |
| Unknown INS risk class | Use ~1% referential and flag for reviewer; do not present as final |
| Self-employed / trabajador independiente | Do NOT apply the fixed employer/employee split — use the graduated five-tier net-income scale; flag for reviewer (Reglamento del Trabajador Independiente) |

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly salary (₡), payroll month/year (to pick 2025 vs 2026 rates), and worker type (dependent employee vs trabajador independiente). Without the gross salary and the period, STOP.

**Recommended** — employer headcount and whether agricultural (for the INA exemption), occupational risk class (for INS), number of dependent children and whether a spouse is claimed (for family tax credits), and whether the amount is ordinary salary or aguinaldo.

**Ideal** — the CCSS planilla detail (per-fund breakdown), the employer's INS riesgos-del-trabajo policy rate, prior D-103 filings, and for self-employed clients the current CCSS independent-worker contribution scale.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-CR-SOC-1 — Period unknown.** *Trigger:* the payroll month/year is not provided. *Message:* "The IVM rate changed on 1 January 2026 (employer 5.42% → 5.58%, employee 4.17% → 4.33%). I cannot compute contributions without knowing which payroll period applies."

**R-CR-SOC-2 — Self-employed contribution amount.** *Trigger:* client asks for the exact CCSS cuota of a trabajador independiente. *Message:* "Independent-worker contributions follow a graduated five-tier scale by net-income band, not the fixed employer/employee split, and the scale and BMC figures must be read off the current CCSS regulation. I can flag the framework, but a Costa Rican CPA must confirm the exact tier and amount."

**R-CR-SOC-3 — CCSS arrears / penalties.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid cuotas obrero-patronales or asks to quantify CCSS penalties/interest. *Message:* "CCSS pursues administrative and judicial collection (cobro judicial) with interest and fines on overdue cuotas; the precise rates are not confirmed in this skill `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`. Do not estimate arrears — escalate to a Costa Rican CPA and request a CCSS statement."

**R-CR-SOC-4 — INS work-risk rate.** *Trigger:* client needs the exact riesgos-del-trabajo premium. *Message:* "The INS work-risk premium is set per occupational risk class; ~1% is only referential. The exact rate must come from the employer's INS policy. Flag for reviewer."

**R-CR-SOC-5 — Expat / cross-border source.** *Trigger:* foreign-source income or treaty questions. *Message:* "Costa Rica taxes on a territorial basis (Costa Rican-source income only). Cross-border, treaty, and totalization questions are outside this skill — escalate to a Costa Rican CPA."

## Section 3 — Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for Costa Rican bank-statement transactions related to social charges and salary-tax withholding. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears on the statement. CCSS, INS-risk, Banco Popular, and D-103 remittances all EXCLUDE from any IVA (VAT) return — they are statutory payroll obligations, not taxable supplies.

## Section 4 — Worked examples

Six bank-statement / payroll classifications for a hypothetical San José services SME and its employees. All figures in CRC (₡). All rates as cited in Sections 1 and 5.

### Example 1 — Employee net pay, mid-range salary (2025)

**Input:** Dependent employee, gross ₡2,000,000/month, payroll June 2025, no children/spouse claimed.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee social deductions = 10.67% × 2,000,000 = **₡213,400** (SEM 5.50% = 110,000; IVM 4.17% = 83,400; Banco Popular 1.00% = 20,000) (siemprealdía, BDO).
- Salary tax (monthly brackets, Decreto 44772-H): first ₡922,000 at 0% = 0; (1,352,000 − 922,000) = 430,000 × 10% = 43,000; (2,000,000 − 1,352,000) = 648,000 × 15% = 97,200. Total salary tax = **₡140,200**.
- Net pay = 2,000,000 − 213,400 − 140,200 = **₡1,646,400**.
- Employer cost on top of gross = 26.67% × 2,000,000 = **₡533,400**; total employer outlay = **₡2,533,400**.

**Classification:** CCSS planilla and D-103 remittances EXCLUDE from IVA. Salary tax withheld and remitted on D-103.

### Example 2 — Same employee, payroll January 2026 (IVM increase)

**Input:** Same ₡2,000,000 gross, payroll January 2026.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee social deductions = 10.83% × 2,000,000 = **₡216,600** (SEM 5.50% = 110,000; IVM 4.33% = 86,600; Banco Popular 1.00% = 20,000) (CCSS noticia, La Nación). The change vs 2025 is +₡3,200 (the +0.16pp IVM rise).
- Salary tax unchanged at this gross (2026 monthly brackets `[RESEARCH GAP — 2026 monthly salary-tax brackets not separately confirmed; 2025 brackets used]`) = **₡140,200** if 2025 brackets still apply.
- Employer cost = 26.83% × 2,000,000 = **₡536,600**.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Flag the bracket-year assumption for reviewer.

### Example 3 — Low-wage employee below the BMC (2025)

**Input:** Part-time employee, gross ₡250,000/month, payroll 2025.

**Reasoning:**
- ₡250,000 is below both the SEM BMC (≈₡333,328) and IVM BMC (≈₡311,990) for 2025 (CCSS BMC data). Contributions are computed on the BMC, not on ₡250,000 (Rule 4 / Default).
- Employee SEM = 5.50% × 333,328 = ₡18,333; IVM = 4.17% × 311,990 = ₡13,010; Banco Popular = 1.00% × 250,000 = ₡2,500 `[RESEARCH GAP — whether the Banco Popular 1% also uses the BMC floor or the actual salary not confirmed; reviewer to confirm]`.
- Salary is far below ₡922,000, so **no salary tax** is due.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Flag the BMC grossing-up and the Banco Popular base for reviewer.

### Example 4 — CCSS planilla debit on the bank statement (BAC)

**Input line:**
`05/07/2025 ; CCSS SICERE PLANILLA JUN ; DEBITO ; CUOTA OBRERO PATRONAL ; -2.450.000 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:** Matches "CCSS SICERE PLANILLA" (pattern 3.1). This is the monthly employer cuota obrero-patronal for the June planilla, paid in the early-July window (reporting window ~26th to the 4th business day of the following month). It bundles SEM, IVM, FODESAF, IMAS, INA, FCL, ROP and the Banco Popular quotas.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA — statutory payroll obligation. Reconcile against the planilla detail.

### Example 5 — D-103 withholding remittance (NOT CCSS)

**Input line:**
`12/07/2025 ; MINISTERIO HACIENDA D-103 ; DEBITO ; RETENCION FUENTE JUN ; -310.000 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:** Matches "MINISTERIO HACIENDA D-103" (pattern 3.3). This is the monthly salary-tax withholding remittance (impuesto al trabajo dependiente), due within the first 15 calendar days of the following month — NOT a social charge. Do not classify as CCSS.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA — income-tax remittance, not a social contribution.

### Example 6 — Aguinaldo payment (exempt)

**Input line:**
`18/12/2025 ; PLANILLA AGUINALDO 2025 ; DEBITO ; 13 SALARIO ; -1.800.000 ; CRC`

**Reasoning:** Matches "AGUINALDO" (pattern 3.4). The mandatory 13th-month salary, payable by 20 December, is exempt from BOTH CCSS social charges and income tax (PwC, MTSS). No CCSS or D-103 withholding applies to this line.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. No social charge, no salary tax. Confirm it is the genuine aguinaldo (~1/12 of Dec–Nov earnings), not an ordinary bonus.

---

## Section 5 — Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when inputs are clear.

### Rule 1 — Territorial basis

Costa Rica taxes individuals on Costa Rican-source income only, regardless of nationality or residence (PwC). Foreign-source income of a Costa Rican resident is outside scope.

### Rule 2 — Employment-income (salary) tax — monthly progressive brackets, 2025

Withheld monthly by the employer; −0.79% adjustment vs 2024; effective 1 Jan–31 Dec 2025 (Decreto 44772-H, Hacienda).

| Monthly band (₡) | Rate | Tax on band | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 922,000 | 0% | 0 | ₡0 |
| 922,000 – 1,352,000 | 10% | up to 43,000 | ₡43,000 |
| 1,352,000 – 2,373,000 | 15% | up to 153,150 | ₡196,150 |
| 2,373,000 – 4,745,000 | 20% | up to 474,400 | ₡670,550 |
| over 4,745,000 | 25% | — | (₡670,550 + 25% of excess) |

Cumulative check: 43,000; 43,000 + (2,373,000−1,352,000)×15% = 43,000 + 153,150 = 196,150; 196,150 + (4,745,000−2,373,000)×20% = 196,150 + 474,400 = 670,550. ✓

### Rule 3 — Family tax credits (créditos fiscales), 2025

Credited against the employee's salary-tax withholding: **₡1,710/month per child** and **₡2,590/month per spouse** (Decreto 44772-H). Apply after computing gross salary tax.

### Rule 4 — Minimum contribution base (BMC)

For low earners, compute CCSS contributions on the BMC, not the actual lower salary: SEM BMC ≈ **₡333,328/month** and IVM BMC ≈ **₡311,990/month** for 2025 (CCSS BMC data). Salaries below are grossed up to the BMC.

### Rule 5 — Total social charges

2025: employer **≈26.67%** + employee **≈10.67%** of gross. From 1 Jan 2026: employer **≈26.83%** + employee **≈10.83%** (siemprealdía, La Nación, BDO). Component breakdown per Section 1.

### Rule 6 — INA small-employer exemption

Non-agricultural employers with **fewer than 5 permanent employees** are exempt from the 1.50% INA contribution, lowering their employer total by 1.50pp (e.g. ~25.17% in 2025) (BDO, BLP).

### Rule 7 — INS work-risk premium is risk-class specific

The mandatory póliza de riesgos del trabajo with INS is set per occupational risk classification; ~1% is only referential (remotepeople). Some "CCSS-only" quotes of ~26.5% exclude it. Always flag the actual rate for reviewer.

### Rule 8 — Banco Popular split

Worker contributes **1.00%** (mandatory savings under the LPT); employer contributes **0.50%** total (siemprealdía). The LPT-funded employer components (Banco Popular 0.50%, FCL 1.50%, ROP/OPC 2.00%) reconcile to the official employer total, but the line allocation is worded differently across sources `[RESEARCH GAP — confirm the ROP vs Banco Popular split against the CCSS planilla rate schedule]`.

### Rule 9 — Aguinaldo

The mandatory 13th-month salary (~1/12 of Dec–Nov total earnings), payable by **20 December**, is exempt from both CCSS social charges and income tax (PwC, MTSS).

### Rule 10 — Minimum wage

Unskilled generic worker (trabajador no calificado genérico): **₡373,092.42/month**, effective 1 Jan 2026 (general +1.63% increase; CNS/MTSS). Differentiated 2026 increases: domestic work +3.96%, specialized +2.18%, mid-level diversified-education technicians +2.50%. 2025 base ≈ ₡367,108 `[RESEARCH GAP — derived by backing out the 1.63% increase; the exact 2025 decree amount was not read directly]`.

### Rule 11 — Self-employed (trabajador independiente)

Independent workers must enroll with CCSS once monthly net income exceeds the reference income (≈₡327,338/month, the SEM BMC, 2025). Their contribution % follows a **graduated five-tier scale by net-income band**, not the fixed employer/employee split (Reglamento del Trabajador Independiente, CCSS). Do not apply the employee 10.67% to a self-employed person.

### Rule 12 — Self-employment / business profit (utilidades) — annual brackets, 2026 period

Independent professionals / sole traders file annual Form D-101 (PwC, 2026 fiscal period):

| Annual band (₡) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 4,094,000 | 0% |
| 4,094,000 – 6,115,000 | 10% |
| 6,115,000 – 10,200,000 | 15% |
| 10,200,000 – 20,442,000 | 20% |
| over 20,442,000 | 25% |

`[RESEARCH GAP — these are 2026-period figures; the 2025 utilidades brackets were not separately isolated.]`

### Rule 13 — Filing

| Item | Detail | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| D-103 (withholding return) | Monthly retención en la fuente — salaries, allowances, dividends, remittances abroad | First 15 calendar days of the following month | BLP, PwC |
| CCSS planilla (SICERE) | Monthly employer social-contribution return and payment | Reporting window ~26th of month to the 4th business day of the next month | Section 4 / general practice |
| D-101 (annual income tax) | Self-employed / businesses; calendar fiscal year Jan–Dec | ~15/16 March | PwC |
| D-151 (annual informative) | Summary of clients, suppliers, specified payments/withholdings | Last business day of February | PwC |

### Rule 14 — Non-resident withholding

25% withholding applies to personal services from a Costa Rican source paid to non-residents (remesas al exterior); reported on Form D-103 (PwC).

---

## Section 6 — Tier 2 catalogue (reviewer judgement)

Flag these for a Costa Rican CPA when data is ambiguous.

### T2-1 — INA exemption eligibility

**Trigger:** employer near the 5-permanent-employee threshold or agricultural. **Issue:** the 1.50% INA drop applies only to non-agricultural employers with fewer than 5 permanent employees; headcount and sector must be confirmed. **Action:** flag; default to INA applying until confirmed.

### T2-2 — INS risk-class rate

**Trigger:** exact employer cost requested. **Issue:** ~1% is referential only; the póliza rate depends on the activity's risk class. **Action:** request the INS policy; flag.

### T2-3 — Self-employed contribution tier

**Trigger:** trabajador independiente needs a cuota amount. **Issue:** five-tier graduated scale by net-income band, not a fixed %. **Action:** read the current CCSS regulation; flag. `[RESEARCH GAP — the 2025 scale table and current BMC figures should be confirmed on the live CCSS/SCIJ regulation.]`

### T2-4 — LPT component allocation

**Trigger:** per-fund employer breakdown must match the planilla exactly. **Issue:** Banco Popular 0.50% / FCL 1.50% / ROP 2.00% allocation is worded differently across sources though the total reconciles. **Action:** reconcile against the CCSS planilla rate schedule; flag.

### T2-5 — 2026 salary-tax brackets

**Trigger:** salary-tax computation for a 2026 payroll period. **Issue:** only the 2025 monthly brackets are confirmed in this skill. **Action:** confirm the 2026 Decreto brackets before withholding. `[RESEARCH GAP — 2026 monthly salary-tax brackets not confirmed.]`

### T2-6 — CCSS / Hacienda penalties and arrears

**Trigger:** late payment, non-registration, or arrears. **Issue:** precise interest/penalty rates not captured. **Action:** do not estimate; escalate. `[RESEARCH GAP — penalty/interest rates not confirmed from an authoritative source.]`

## Section 8 — Bank statement reading guide

### How payroll obligations appear on Costa Rican bank statements

**BAC Credomatic / Banco Nacional (BN) / Banco de Costa Rica (BCR) / Davivienda / Scotiabank:**
- CCSS planilla: "CCSS", "SICERE", "PLANILLA CCSS", "CAJA COSTARRICENSE", "CUOTA OBRERO PATRONAL"
- INS work-risk: "INS", "RIESGOS DEL TRABAJO", "POLIZA RIESGOS"
- Salary-tax remittance: "HACIENDA", "TRIBUTACION", "D-103", "RETENCION FUENTE"
- Banco Popular quota: "BANCO POPULAR", "BP DESARROLLO COMUNAL"
- Net wages: "SALARIO", "PLANILLA NETA", "PAGO QUINCENA"; bonus: "AGUINALDO"

**Spanish ↔ English glossary:**
- *Cargas sociales* = social charges; *cuota obrero-patronal* = employee+employer contribution
- *Planilla* = payroll / contribution return; *patrono* = employer
- *Retención en la fuente* = withholding at source; *aguinaldo* = 13th-month salary
- *Débito / Crédito* = debit / credit; *salario bruto / neto* = gross / net salary
- *Trabajador independiente* = self-employed worker; *BMC (base mínima contributiva)* = minimum contribution base

**Key identification tips:**
1. CCSS planilla debits are monthly and outgoing, in the ~26th-to-4th-business-day window.
2. The planilla amount bundles all funds; do not split unless you have the planilla detail.
3. D-103 (Hacienda) is income-tax withholding, NOT a social charge — keep them separate.
4. Aguinaldo lines (December) carry no social charge and no salary tax.
5. Incoming CCSS credits are benefits received, not contributions.

## Section 9 — Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no payroll detail:

1. **Scan for CCSS / SICERE debits** — identify monthly outgoing planilla payments (Section 3.1).
2. **Separate Hacienda D-103** withholding remittances (income tax) from CCSS (social charges).
3. **Estimate gross payroll:** a CCSS planilla debit ≈ 26.67% (2025) / 26.83% (2026) of total gross; reverse to approximate gross = planilla ÷ 0.2667 (employer share). Flag as an estimate.
4. **Check December** for an aguinaldo line (exempt — exclude from both bases).
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank-statement amounts only; per-fund split, BMC grossing-up, INA exemption, INS risk class, and salary-tax withholding have not been independently verified. A Costa Rican CPA must confirm before filing."

### Test suite

Recompute each end-to-end before relying on it.

**Test 1 — Employee deductions, 2025.** Gross ₡1,000,000. Employee = 10.67% = **₡106,700** (SEM 55,000 + IVM 41,700 + BP 10,000). Salary tax: (1,000,000 − 922,000) × 10% = **₡7,800**. Net = 1,000,000 − 106,700 − 7,800 = **₡885,500**.

**Test 2 — Employee deductions, 2026.** Gross ₡1,000,000. Employee = 10.83% = **₡108,300** (SEM 55,000 + IVM 43,300 + BP 10,000). +₡1,600 vs 2025 from the IVM rise.

**Test 3 — Employer cost, 2025.** Gross ₡1,000,000. Employer = 26.67% = **₡266,700**. Total outlay = **₡1,266,700**.

**Test 4 — Employer cost, 2026.** Gross ₡1,000,000. Employer = 26.83% = **₡268,300**.

**Test 5 — Below-BMC employee, 2025.** Gross ₡250,000 (< BMC). SEM on 333,328 = 5.50% = ₡18,333; IVM on 311,990 = 4.17% = ₡13,010. No salary tax (< ₡922,000).

**Test 6 — High earner salary tax, 2025.** Gross ₡5,000,000. Salary tax = 670,550 + (5,000,000 − 4,745,000) × 25% = 670,550 + 63,750 = **₡734,300**.

**Test 7 — INA small employer, 2025.** Non-agricultural employer with 4 permanent employees → drop INA 1.50% → employer total ≈ **25.17%**.

**Test 8 — Aguinaldo.** ₡1,800,000 December aguinaldo → **₡0** CCSS, **₡0** salary tax (exempt).

**Test 9 — Family credits, 2025.** Gross ₡2,000,000, 2 children + spouse. Gross salary tax ₡140,200 (per Example 1) − (2 × ₡1,710) − ₡2,590 = 140,200 − 3,420 − 2,590 = **₡134,190** net withholding.

**Test 10 — Self-employed.** Trabajador independiente, net income ₡500,000/month → enroll with CCSS (> ₡327,338); contribution via five-tier scale, NOT 10.67%. Flag for reviewer.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the employee 10.67%/10.83% split to a self-employed person — use the CCSS five-tier independent-worker scale.
- NEVER compute contributions on a sub-BMC salary without grossing up to the BMC floor.
- NEVER use 2025 IVM rates for a payroll period on/after 1 January 2026 (or vice versa).
- NEVER charge CCSS or salary tax on the aguinaldo — it is exempt from both.
- NEVER present the INS work-risk premium (~1%) as final — it is risk-class specific.
- NEVER drop the 1.50% INA without confirming the employer is non-agricultural with fewer than 5 permanent employees.
- NEVER conflate the D-103 income-tax remittance with the CCSS planilla — they are separate obligations to separate authorities.
- NEVER quantify CCSS or Hacienda arrears/penalties — escalate; rates are a research gap.
- NEVER treat foreign-source income as taxable — Costa Rica is territorial.
- NEVER present any figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP]` as confirmed without a Costa Rican CPA's sign-off.
