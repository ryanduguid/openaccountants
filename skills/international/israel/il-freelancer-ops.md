## Section 3 — Invoice requirements

### 3.1 General rules

- Invoice numbering must be sequential with no gaps
- All invoices must include the freelancer's Osek number (מספר עוסק — 9-digit taxpayer ID)
- Osek Murshe: must issue Heshbonit Mas (tax invoice) showing VAT separately
- Osek Patur: issues Kabala (receipt) only — must NOT show VAT

### 3.2 Allocation numbers (Mispar Haktzaa — מספר הקצאה)

From 2026, Osek Murshe must obtain an allocation number from the Tax Authority system for tax invoices:

| Effective date | Invoice threshold (before VAT) |
|---|---|
| January 2026 | NIS 10,000 |
| June 2026 | NIS 5,000 |

Without an allocation number, the recipient cannot deduct input VAT. Flag any issued invoice above the threshold that is missing an allocation number.

## Section 4 — Tax deadline calendar

### 4.1 Periodic deadlines

| Deadline | Frequency | Date | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| VAT filing (Osek Murshe, bi-monthly) | Bi-monthly | 15th of the month after the period | Mar 15, May 15, Jul 15, Sep 15, Nov 15, Jan 15 |
| VAT filing (monthly filers) | Monthly | 15th of each month | For businesses exceeding the monthly threshold |
| Detailed VAT report (Doch Meforat, report 874) | Monthly | 23rd of the following month | Required for annual turnover > NIS 500,000; forces monthly filing |
| Bituach Leumi advances | Monthly | 15th of each month | National Insurance advance payments |
| Mkdamot (income tax advances) — monthly filers | Monthly | 15th of the month after the period | Per Tax Authority assessment letter |
| Mkdamot — bi-monthly filers | Bi-monthly | 19th of the month after the period | Per Tax Authority assessment letter |

### 4.2 Annual deadlines

| Deadline | Date | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Osek Patur annual turnover declaration | January 31 | Report previous year's turnover to VAT office |
| Annual income tax report (Form 1301) — paper | May 31 | For tax year 2025 filed in 2026 |
| Annual income tax report (Form 1301) — online | June 30 | Online filing mandatory for most filers |
| Annual income tax report — CPA extension | July 31 or later | Via CPA association quota arrangement |
| Self-employed pension deposit deadline | December 31 | Last day to deposit for that tax year's benefits |

**If a deadline falls on Shabbat (Saturday), it moves to Sunday. If it falls on a Jewish holiday (Chag), check the ITA website for adjusted dates.**

### 4.3 Pension contribution deadlines (December 31)

Missing December 31 forfeits both tax benefits for the entire year:

**Section 45א — 35% tax credit (Zikui)**
- Credit on contributions up to 5.5% of business income
- 2026 cap: approximately NIS 11,640 + NIS 1,164

**Section 47 — Income deduction (Nikui)**
- Deduction of up to 11% of qualifying income
- 2026 qualifying-income ceiling: NIS 232,800; max deposit approximately NIS 25,608

**Mandatory self-employed pension contribution (separate from 45א/47)**
- 2026 rates: 4.45% on income up to half the average wage; 12.55% above it
- Average wage 2026: NIS 13,769/month
- This is a legal obligation, not just a tax benefit

## Section 5 — Osek Patur threshold monitoring

### 5.1 Alert levels

Track cumulative annual revenue against the Osek Patur threshold:

| Alert level | Revenue (2026) | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Informational (70%) | ~NIS 86,000 | "You've reached 70% of the annual threshold. Consider planning for potential transition." |
| Warning (85%) | ~NIS 104,400 | "Approaching threshold. Review implications of converting to Osek Murshe." |
| Urgent (95%) | ~NIS 116,700 | "Very close to threshold. Conversion may be required soon." |

### 5.2 Transition implications

When the threshold is exceeded, the freelancer must:

1. Register as Osek Murshe at the local Tax Authority office (Misrad Mas Hachnasa — משרד מס הכנסה)
2. Begin charging VAT (18%) on all invoices
3. Switch to issuing Heshbonit Mas (tax invoices) instead of Kabala (receipts)
4. Register for the allocation number system (for invoices above the threshold)
5. Begin filing periodic VAT returns
6. Start tracking input VAT on business expenses for deductions
7. Notify clients of new invoicing format
8. Bituach Leumi payments may increase

### 5.3 Esek Za'ir alternative

If income is expected to stay near the threshold, the Esek Za'ir track offers a 30% normative expense deduction and simplified reporting but shares the same revenue ceiling as Osek Patur. It does not defer the obligation to convert to Osek Murshe if the threshold is exceeded.

## Section 6 — Bituach Leumi (National Insurance) for self-employed

### 6.1 Contribution rates (2026)

| Income range | NI rate | Health rate | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to NIS 7,703/month | 2.87% | 3.10% | 5.97% |
| NIS 7,703 – NIS 51,910/month | 12.83% | 5.00% | 17.83% |

- Minimum monthly advance: NIS 187
- Maximum monthly advance: NIS 7,850
- Minimum income floor: NIS 2,065/month
- Direct-debit payers (הוראת קבע) get an automatic extension to the 22nd
- 52% of the NI amount is tax-deductible for income tax purposes

## Section 7 — Accountant package (Havila L'Roe Cheshbon — חבילה לרואה חשבון)

2. **Received invoices/receipts** — all expense documents (business purchases, subscriptions, equipment)
3. **Bank statement summary** — transaction list matched to invoices where possible
4. **Utility bills** — electricity, telecoms, water, organized by provider
5. **Revenue summary** — running annual total with monthly breakdown
6. **Cover sheet** — summary page with key figures

### 7.2 Cover sheet fields

## Section 8 — Invoice aging tracker

Track all issued invoices by payment status:

| Bucket | Age | Recommended action |
|---|---|---|
| Current | 0–29 days | Monitor, no action needed |
| 30-day | 30–59 days | Friendly reminder to client |
| 60-day | 60–89 days | Formal follow-up with invoice copy and payment details |
| 90+ day | 90+ days | Alert for escalation consideration |

Track partial payments and maintain running totals: total outstanding, total overdue, by client.

## Section 9 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Osek Patur approaching threshold

**Scenario:** Freelance web developer, Osek Patur, has earned NIS 95,000 by September with 3 months remaining.

**Working:**
- Average monthly income: NIS 95,000 ÷ 9 = ~NIS 10,556
- Projected annual total: NIS 10,556 × 12 = ~NIS 126,667
- 2025 threshold: NIS 120,000
- Status: projected to exceed threshold by ~NIS 6,667

**Action:** Alert at 85% level. Prepare transition checklist. Recommend consulting accountant before crossing the threshold.

### Example 2 — Pension contribution deadline

**Scenario:** Self-employed consultant, annual business income NIS 300,000. December 15, no pension deposits yet.

**Working:**
- Section 45א credit: 35% on up to 5.5% of NIS 300,000 = NIS 16,500 eligible → NIS 5,775 tax credit
- Section 47 deduction: up to 11% of NIS 300,000 = NIS 33,000 deductible (marginal benefit depends on tax bracket)
- Mandatory contribution: 4.45% on income up to half the average wage + 12.55% above it
- Deadline: December 31 — missing it forfeits both benefits for the entire year

**Action:** Urgent alert. Deposit to pension fund, Kupat Gemel, or insurance policy before December 31.

## Section 10 — Common errors and red flags

| Error | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Confusing Osek Murshe with Osek Patur | Different VAT obligations, invoice types, and filing requirements |
| Skipping zero-revenue VAT returns | Osek Murshe must file bi-monthly returns even with no revenue; missing reports trigger penalties |
| Gap in invoice numbering | Violates Tax Authority requirements; sequential numbering is mandatory |
| Missing allocation number on invoices > NIS 10,000 | From 2026, recipient loses input VAT deduction |
| Wrong annual report deadline | Form 1301 is due May 31 (paper) / June 30 (online) — not April 30 |
| Confusing Section 45א credit with mandatory pension | They are separate: 45א/47 are voluntary tax benefits; mandatory contribution is a legal floor |
| Using Bituach Leumi based on monthly actual revenue | BL advances are based on projected annual income, not actual monthly revenue |
