## Section 4 — Income tax brackets (2026)

Brackets 1–2 and 6 frozen at 2025 values; brackets 3–5 expanded by the Economic Efficiency Law 2026 (approved March 30, 2026, retroactive to January 1, 2026):

| Bracket | Annual income range (NIS) | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 – 84,120 | 10% |
| 2 | 84,121 – 120,720 | 14% |
| 3 | 120,721 – 228,000 | 20% |
| 4 | 228,001 – 301,200 | 31% |
| 5 | 301,201 – 560,280 | 35% |
| 6 | 560,281 – 721,560 | 47% |
| Surtax | Above 721,560 | See Section 5 |

### Monthly equivalent brackets

| Monthly income (NIS) | Rate |
|---|---|
| Up to 7,010 | 10% |
| 7,011 – 10,060 | 14% |
| 10,061 – 19,000 | 20% |
| 19,001 – 25,100 | 31% |
| 25,101 – 46,690 | 35% |
| 46,691 and above | 47% |

---

## Section 5 — Surtax (Mas Yesafim — מס יסף)

Two-tier system from 2026:

| Income type | Rate above NIS 721,560 | Effective top rate |
|---|---|---|
| Employment and active income | 3% | 50% (47% + 3%) |
| Capital and passive income (dividends, interest, rent, capital gains) | 5% (3% base + 2% additional) | 30% (25% + 5%) for capital gains |

From 2026, Mas Shevach (real estate capital gains) on investment properties is included in the surtax income calculation.

The NIS 721,560 threshold is frozen through tax year 2027 — do not apply CPI uplifts.

---

## Section 6 — Nekudot Zikui (נקודות זיכוי — Tax credit points)

Each point reduces the annual tax liability by NIS 2,904 (approximately NIS 242/month). Frozen 2025–2027.

| Category | Points | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Israeli resident (male) | 2.25 | Base entitlement |
| Israeli resident (female) | 2.75 | Base (0.5 additional) |
| New immigrant (Oleh Chadash — עולה חדש) | 3.0 year 1, 2.0 year 2, 1.0 year 3 | For 3.5 years from Aliyah date (post-2022: 8.5 points over 54 months) |
| Returning resident (Toshav Chozer — תושב חוזר) | Same as Oleh Chadash | After 10+ years abroad |
| Child born during tax year | 1.5 | Per child |
| Children aged 1–5 | 2.5 per child | Per child |
| Children aged 6–17 | 1.0 per child | Per child |
| Child aged 18 | 0.5 | Last year of child credit |
| Single parent | 1.0 | Divorced, widowed, or separated with custody |
| Academic degree (BA) | 1.0 | Per year, up to 3 years matching study duration (graduates 2023+) |
| Academic degree (MA) | 0.5 | For 2 years after completion (graduates 2023+) |
| Vocational certificate | 1.0 | Per year, up to 3 years matching study duration (graduates 2023+) |
| Disability (100% or blind) | 2.0 | Permanent |
| Combat reserve soldiers | 0.5–1.0 | Based on reserve days (from 2026: 0.5 for 20+ days, 0.75 for 45+, 1.0 for 60+) |

### Worked example

Married woman (2.75 points) with two children aged 3 and 7 (2.5 + 1.0 = 3.5 points):
- Total: 6.25 points × NIS 2,904 = **NIS 18,150** annual tax reduction

---

## Section 7 — Pension contribution credits

### 7.1 Section 45א — 35% tax credit (Zikui)

- Reduces tax liability directly by 35% of qualifying pension contribution
- Applies to both employees and self-employed
- Employee ceiling: qualifying contribution up to 7% of eligible salary (capped at NIS 23,232/month for 2026)
- Self-employed ceiling: 5.5% of business income

### 7.2 Section 47 — Pension deduction (Nikui)

- Reduces taxable income by the contribution amount
- Self-employed can deduct up to 11% of annual business income (capped at qualifying ceiling)
- Employee contributions above the 7% Section 45א threshold can qualify

### 7.3 Combined rule

The same shekel cannot double-count. Self-employed filers typically structure deposits so part qualifies for 45א (credit) and part for 47 (deduction) within the 16.5% combined ceiling.

### Worked example (self-employed, NIS 300,000 annual income)

| Benefit | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Pension deposit | NIS 33,000 (11% of income) |
| Section 47 deduction | Reduces taxable income by up to NIS 33,000 |
| Section 45א credit | 35% of up to 5.5% of income = up to NIS 16,500 eligible → NIS 5,775 direct tax reduction |

---

## Section 8 — Rental income tax tracks

Israeli law offers three options for taxing residential rental income:

| Track | Rate | Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Exempt | 0% | Monthly rent below NIS 5,654/month (2025–2027, frozen, no longer CPI-indexed) |
| Flat rate | 10% | On gross rent, no deductions allowed. Payment by January 31 of following year |
| Marginal | Progressive rates (10%–50%) | Full deduction of expenses (depreciation, mortgage interest, maintenance). Filed with Form 1301 |

---

## Section 9 — Capital gains

### 9.1 Real estate (Mas Shevach — מס שבח)

**Filing:** Within 30 days of sale (40 days if requesting exemption).

**Calculation:**
```
Sale price
− Original purchase price (adjusted for CPI)
− Allowable deductions (purchase tax paid, legal fees, agent commission, renovation costs with receipts)
= Real capital gain (Shevach Re'ali — שבח ריאלי)
× 25% tax rate
= Mas Shevach payable
```

**Single apartment exemption (Ptur Dira Yechida — פטור דירה יחידה):**
- Seller's only residential property in Israel
- Owned for at least 18 months
- Sale price below NIS 5,008,000 (2024–2027, frozen)
- Seller is an Israeli resident
- Partial exemption applies proportionally above the ceiling

**Linear method (Shita Liniarit — שיטה ליניארית):**
For properties purchased before January 7, 2014, only the portion of gain attributable to the period after that date is taxed at 25%. The pre-2014 portion may be exempt or taxed at a lower historical rate.

### 9.2 Securities (Forms 1322/1325)

- 25% tax rate for individuals on traded securities
- 30% if seller holds 10%+ of the company
- Losses can offset gains within the same category in the same tax year
- Capital losses carry forward to offset future capital gains (but not ordinary income)

---

## Section 10 — Advance tax payments (Mikdamot — מקדמות)

### 10.1 How they work

- The ITA sets a percentage rate based on prior year returns
- Applied to bi-monthly turnover (total revenue excluding VAT)
- New businesses receive a percentage based on industry statistics

### 10.2 Payment schedule

| Period | Months | Payment due |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | January – February | March 15 |
| 2 | March – April | May 15 |
| 3 | May – June | July 15 |
| 4 | July – August | September 15 |
| 5 | September – October | November 15 |
| 6 | November – December | January 15 |

### 10.3 Year-end reconciliation

- Mikdamot paid > actual tax → refund (Hechzer Mas — החזר מס)
- Mikdamot paid < actual tax → difference owed (plus possible interest)
- Rate adjustment available mid-year if income changes significantly (Shinui Shiur Mikdamot — שינוי שיעור מקדמות)

---

## Section 11 — Corporate tax

| Item | Rate / rule |
|---|---|
| Corporate tax rate | 23% flat on taxable profits |
| Closely held company (Chevra Me'atim — חברה מעטים) | 2% annual tax on accumulated undistributed profits unless 6%+ distributed as dividends |
| Form 6111 | Required for turnover > NIS 300,000 (including VAT) |
| Deadline | May 31 (extensions available) |

---

## Section 12 — Form 6111 (standardized financial statements)

Required for any business with annual turnover exceeding NIS 300,000 (including VAT).

**Section A: Profit and Loss Statement**
- Revenue by source, COGS, operating expenses, financial income/expenses, depreciation, net profit, tax adjustments

**Section B: Balance Sheet**

---

## Section 14 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Freelancer annual return (Form 1301)

**Scenario:** Male freelance developer (Osek Murshe), annual business revenue NIS 450,000, business expenses NIS 80,000, two children aged 4 and 8.

**Working:**
- Net business income: NIS 450,000 − NIS 80,000 = NIS 370,000
- Credit points: 2.25 (resident) + 2.5 (child age 4) + 1.0 (child age 8) = 5.75 points
- Tax credit: 5.75 × NIS 2,904 = NIS 16,698
- Income tax (applying 2026 brackets to NIS 370,000):
  - 10% on 84,120 = NIS 8,412
  - 14% on 36,600 = NIS 5,124
  - 20% on 107,280 = NIS 21,456
  - 31% on 73,200 = NIS 22,692
  - 35% on 68,800 = NIS 24,080
  - **Gross tax: NIS 81,764**
- Less credit points: NIS 81,764 − NIS 16,698 = **NIS 65,066 income tax**
- Less mikdamot paid during year → net tax due or refund

### Example 2 — Real estate capital gains (Mas Shevach)

**Scenario:** Investment apartment sold for NIS 2,800,000, purchased in 2018 for NIS 1,600,000.

**Working:**
- Gross gain: NIS 2,800,000 − NIS 1,600,000 = NIS 1,200,000
- Adjust for CPI change from 2018 to sale date
- Deduct allowable expenses (purchase tax, legal fees, agent commission, documented renovation)
- Real gain × 25% = Mas Shevach payable
- File within 30 days of sale
- Check surtax: if total annual income exceeds NIS 721,560, additional 5% on capital gain portion above threshold

---

## Section 15 — Common errors

| Error | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| Using US form numbers (1040) | Israel uses Form 1301 for individuals |
| Wrong deadline (April 30 for Form 1301) | April 30 is the legacy paper baseline; current online deadline is June 30 |
| Single capital gains rate for everything | Securities: 25%; significant shareholders: 30%; real estate: varies |
| Default credit point value without checking eligibility | Points vary by personal status; must calculate per individual |
| Treating Mas Shevach and surtax as separate | From 2026, investment property Mas Shevach counts toward surtax income |
| Forgetting Section 45א/47 pension credits | One of the most common filing errors for self-employed |
