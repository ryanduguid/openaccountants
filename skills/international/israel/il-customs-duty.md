## Section 1 — Quick reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Israel (מדינת ישראל) |
| Scope | Customs duty, VAT, and purchase tax on imports |
| Currency | NIS (Israeli New Shekel — ₪) |
| VAT rate | 18% (effective January 2025) |
| Personal import threshold | USD 75 (as of May 2026 — verify before use) |
| Tariff lookup | Shaar Olami — https://shaarolami-query.customs.mof.gov.il/CustomspilotWeb/en/CustomsBook/Import/Doubt |
| Official calculator | https://www.gov.il/en/service/customs-tax-calculation-import-by-israelis |
| Exchange rates | Bank of Israel — https://www.boi.org.il/en/economic-roles/financial-markets/exchange-rates/ |
| Tax authority | Israel Tax Authority (ITA — רשות המיסים) |
| Contributor | Open Accountants Community |
| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by Israel-licensed רואה חשבון or יועץ מס |

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown personal import threshold | Use USD 75 — verify via official calculator |
| Unknown HS code (last 2 digits) | Do not guess — request pre-ruling from Israel Customs |
| Unknown origin of goods | Apply MFN duty rate (no FTA preference) |
| Unknown whether EUR.1 is valid | Treat as invalid — apply full duty |
| Unknown purchase tax rate | Check Shaar Olami for the specific 8-digit code |

---

## Section 2 — Import types

| Type | Typical importer | Tax treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Personal import, small parcel | Consumer ordering online | Exemption threshold applies |
| Personal import, high-value | Consumer buying jewelry, electronics | Full duty + VAT + purchase tax |
| Commercial import (B2B) | Osek Murshe importing stock | Full duty + VAT (VAT is recoverable); no threshold exemption |
| Gift | Individual sending to an Israeli | Treated as personal import, no special exemption |
| Oleh Hadash belongings | New immigrant | Separate Oleh exemption — consult the Aliyah unit |

### Courier vs postal clearance

Courier shipments (DHL, FedEx, UPS) are self-cleared by the courier, which bills the importer duty, VAT, and a handling fee. Israel Post parcels go through postal clearance: low-value items clear automatically, items above the threshold get a payment demand before delivery. The tax math is the same; fees and timelines differ.

---

## Section 3 — Personal import threshold

As of May 2026, the personal import VAT exemption is **USD 75** (cost of goods, excluding shipping and insurance).

**Recent history:** The threshold was raised to USD 150 via a Smotrich decree in November 2025, then revoked by the Knesset on 24 February 2026, returning to USD 75. **Always verify the current threshold via the official calculator before quoting a number.**

| Value range | Tax treatment |
|---|---|
| Below USD 75 | No customs, no VAT, no purchase tax |
| USD 75 – USD 500 (approx) | VAT + purchase tax typically apply; customs duty often waived for personal imports |
| Above USD 500 | Full duty + VAT + purchase tax; commercial clearance rules apply |

**Shipping and insurance** are excluded from the personal import threshold test but are included in CIF for commercial imports. Do not mix the two rules.

---

## Section 4 — HS code classification

Israel uses the international Harmonized System at the 6-digit level plus 2 Israel-specific digits (positions 7 and 8):

1. Describe the product: material, function, packaging form, use, brand, model
2. Start from the 2- or 4-digit HS chapter (e.g., chapter 85 for electronics, chapter 61 for apparel)
3. Look up the full 8-digit code in Shaar Olami: https://shaarolami-query.customs.mof.gov.il/CustomspilotWeb/en/CustomsBook/Import/Doubt
4. **Do not guess the last 2 digits** — a US HTS code or EU CN code does NOT translate directly to the Israeli code

For certainty, request a free binding pre-ruling from Israeli Customs with a product description and catalog.

---

## Section 5 — Duty, VAT, and purchase tax rates

From the Shaar Olami entry for the HS code, read:

| Tax | Typical range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Customs duty | 0–12% (many goods duty-free under MFN bindings) | Varies by HS code |
| VAT | 18% standard | Applied on CIF + duty + purchase tax |
| Purchase tax (Mas Kniya — מס קנייה) | Only on specific items | Alcohol, tobacco, perfumes, some electronics, passenger cars — rates can be very high |

**Purchase tax is NOT a small rounding item.** Alcohol and tobacco can carry rates in the hundreds of percent.

---

## Section 6 — Landed cost calculation

The three taxes are calculated on a cascading base:

### 6.1 CIF value

Israel Customs values goods at CIF: cost + insurance + freight.

```
CIF (NIS) = (product price + shipping + insurance) × USD-to-NIS rate
```

Use the Bank of Israel daily rate for the clearance date.

### 6.2 Cascading tax formula

```
Duty            = CIF × duty rate
Base after duty = CIF + duty
Purchase tax    = base after duty × purchase tax rate
Base for VAT    = base after duty + purchase tax
VAT             = base for VAT × 0.18
Landed cost     = CIF + duty + purchase tax + VAT + broker fees + handling
```

### 6.3 Worked example — personal import above threshold

**Scenario:** Camera from Amazon US, USD 200 + USD 20 shipping.

| Line | Amount |
|---|---|
| Product price | USD 200 |
| Shipping | USD 20 |
| CIF (assuming USD/NIS 3.65) | NIS 803 |
| Customs duty (0% for digital cameras under MFN) | NIS 0 |
| Purchase tax (check HS code — typically 0% for cameras) | NIS 0 |
| VAT (18% on NIS 803) | NIS 145 |
| Broker/handling fee (typical parcel) | NIS 100–400 |
| **Estimated total landed cost** | **~NIS 1,048–1,348** |

---

## Section 7 — Free trade agreement (FTA) preferences

A valid origin proof can eliminate the customs duty (but NOT VAT or purchase tax):

| Origin | Agreement | Origin proof required |
|---|---|---|
| United States | US-Israel FTA (1985) | US Origin Invoice Declaration on the commercial invoice |
| European Union | EU-Israel Association Agreement | EUR.1 movement certificate, or invoice declaration under €6,000 |
| United Kingdom | UK-Israel Trade and Partnership Agreement (2019) | EUR.1 movement certificate, or invoice declaration under €6,000 |
| Canada | Modernized CIFTA (September 2019) | Form B239 certificate of origin |
| EFTA (CH, NO, IS, LI) | EFTA-Israel Free Trade Agreement | EUR.1 movement certificate |
| Mercosur (BR, AR, UY, PY) | Mercosur-Israel FTA (in force June 2010) | Mercosur-Israel certificate of origin |

### EUR.1 requirements

- Must carry a **wet-ink (original) signature** — Israel does NOT accept electronically signed EUR.1 certificates
- For shipments above €6,000, an EUR.1 stamped by the origin country's customs is required
- For below €6,000, an invoice declaration by a non-approved exporter is sufficient
- For repeat shipments, the exporter should apply for approved-exporter status so invoice declarations cover any value
- Plan courier time for the original document to arrive

### Worked example — EU commercial import with EUR.1

**Scenario:** 50 Italian leather bags, CIF €12,000, HS 4202.21.xx.

| Line | Without EUR.1 | With valid EUR.1 |
|---|---|---|
| CIF | €12,000 | €12,000 |
| Duty (6–12% typical for leather bags) | €720–1,440 | €0 (waived) |
| Purchase tax | Typically 0% | 0% |
| VAT (18% on CIF + duty) | €2,290–2,419 | €2,160 |
| **Savings from EUR.1** | — | **€720–1,440 duty saved** |

Since CIF > €6,000, an EUR.1 movement certificate stamped by Italian customs is required (invoice declaration alone insufficient unless exporter holds approved-exporter status).

## Section 8 — Common errors

| Error | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Using US or EU HS code directly | Last 2 digits are Israel-specific — wrong code = wrong duty rate |
| Applying old personal import threshold (USD 150) | Reverted to USD 75 in February 2026 |
| Including shipping in personal threshold test | Shipping is excluded from the USD 75 test |
| Forgetting cascading tax calculation | VAT is on CIF + duty + purchase tax, not on product price alone |
| Accepting electronic EUR.1 | Israel requires wet-ink original |
| Assuming FTA removes all taxes | FTA removes duty only; VAT and purchase tax still apply |
| Underestimating purchase tax | Alcohol, tobacco, cars can have very high purchase tax rates |

---

## Section 9 — Tier 2 items (require professional input)

| Item | Why it needs a professional |
|---|---|
| Binding HS classification pre-ruling | Complex product classification |
| Temporary import (ATA Carnet) | Different rules for goods temporarily entering Israel |
| Eilat free zone imports | Special zero-VAT zone rules |
| Oleh Hadash belongings exemption | Separate exemption schedule and eligibility rules |
| Anti-dumping duties | Certain goods from specific countries carry additional duties |
| Agricultural imports | Seasonal quotas and variable levies may apply |
