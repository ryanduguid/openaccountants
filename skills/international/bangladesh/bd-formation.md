# Bangladesh Business Formation — Skill v1.0

| Multi-owner | Partnership (registered under the Partnership Act) |

| Core registrations | **TIN** (NBR, etaxnbr.gov.bd) + **trade licence** (city corporation / pourashava / union parishad) |

| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Vehicle unknown | Sole proprietorship for a solo freelancer |
| VAT registration | Required once over the threshold; voluntary below |
| Filer status | Recommend TIN + annual e-Return (avoids higher TDS) |

## Section 2 — Steps for a solo freelancer (Tier 1)
1. **Get a TIN** from the NBR (etaxnbr.gov.bd) using your NID — registers you as a taxpayer.
2. **Obtain a trade licence** from the local authority (city corporation / pourashava / union parishad) for the business name/activity.
3. **Open a business bank account** (needed for export remittances / encashment certificates).
4. **VAT (BIN):** register with the NBR if turnover exceeds the VAT-registration threshold (see bangladesh-vat).
5. **E-commerce:** obtain a **DBID** if selling online.
6. **File the annual e-Return** to stay a filer (lower TDS, access to services).

## Section 3 — Sole proprietor vs partnership vs company
| Factor | Sole proprietor | Partnership | Private Ltd (RJSC) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Setup | Trade licence + TIN | Partnership deed | RJSC incorporation |
| Liability | Personal | Shared | Limited |
| Reporting | Tax return only | Tax return | RJSC financial statements + audit |
| Best for | Solo freelancer | Partners | Scaling/investors |

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER skip the trade licence for a registered business activity.
- NEVER omit VAT (BIN) registration once over the threshold.
- NEVER state thresholds without verifying current NBR/local rules.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify registration steps and thresholds with the NBR, RJSC, and local authority. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Bangladeshi practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
