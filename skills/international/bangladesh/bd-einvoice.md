# Bangladesh E-Invoicing & Fiscal Compliance — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Bangladesh |
| VAT fiscal devices | EFD (Electronic Fiscal Device) / SDC (Sales Data Controller) rolled out by the NBR for certain retail/service businesses to transmit sales data in real time |
| VAT invoice | Mushak-6.3 (tax invoice); VAT return Mushak-9.1 |
| Income tax | Filed via the NBR e-Return (etaxnbr.gov.bd) — no universal mandatory e-invoicing for income tax |
| Authority | National Board of Revenue (NBR) |
| Currency | BDT (৳) |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Bangladeshi practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

## Section 2 — Key points (Tier 1)
- **VAT-registered businesses** issue the prescribed **Mushak-6.3** tax invoice and file **Mushak-9.1** returns. The NBR has been deploying **EFD/SDC** machines to specified retail and service categories to report sales to the NBR in real time — **scope is being expanded by SRO**; verify whether the business is in scope.
- A **non-VAT solo freelancer** is **not** within the EFD/Mushak regime — they simply issue a proper invoice showing their TIN and keep records (see bd-bookkeeping). Income tax is filed via the **e-Return**, not an e-invoicing system.
- Foreign-currency export receipts need the **bank encashment certificate** rather than a VAT invoice.

## Section 3 — Worked example
A VAT-registered IT services firm: issues Mushak-6.3 invoices, files Mushak-9.1 monthly, and uses an EFD/SDC if in a notified category. A non-registered freelancer just issues TIN invoices and keeps encashment certificates.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER tell a VAT-registered, in-scope business they can skip EFD/Mushak compliance.
- NEVER assume a universal income-tax e-invoicing mandate — there isn't one; income tax is the e-Return.
- NEVER state EFD scope/SRO dates without verifying current NBR notifications.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify EFD/Mushak scope and dates with the NBR. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Bangladeshi practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
