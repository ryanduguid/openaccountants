# Bangladesh Payroll & Salary Withholding — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Item | Who | Notes (verify current Finance Act) |
|---|---|---|
| Salary income tax (TDS) | Employer withholds from employee | Individual slabs; first ~৳350,000 tax-free |
| Provident fund | Employer scheme (if any) | Recognised PF — contributions/withdrawals have specific tax rules |
| Gratuity | Employer scheme (if any) | Per the Labour Act / scheme |
| Universal Pension (Progoti) | Private-sector employees — voluntary | Employee + employer contribution |
| Monthly TDS deposit + returns | Employer → NBR | Deposit withheld tax; file the withholding return |
| Currency | — | BDT (৳) |
| Quality tier | — | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Bangladeshi practitioner |

## Section 2 — Mechanics (Tier 1)
- The employer estimates each employee's annual tax under the **individual slabs** (with the tax-free threshold and any rebate), divides across the year, **withholds monthly (TDS)**, deposits to the NBR, and files the **monthly/periodic withholding return**.
- **No broad national social-security payroll tax.** Benefits run through **provident fund** and **gratuity** schemes where the employer operates them; the **Universal Pension Scheme (Progoti)** is a voluntary option for private employees.
- A **solo freelancer with no employees** has no payroll obligation (see bd-social-contributions).

## Section 3 — Worked example
A studio pays an employee ৳600,000/year: compute tax on the slabs (first ~৳350,000 tax-free; remainder at the applicable rates — verify), withhold ~1/12 monthly, deposit to the NBR, and file the withholding return. PF/gratuity only if the employer runs such schemes.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER skip monthly TDS deposit/return for salaried staff.
- NEVER assume a mandatory national social-insurance payroll tax (there isn't a broad one).
- NEVER state slab/rebate figures without verifying the current Finance Act.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify withholding slabs, PF/gratuity, and pension rules with the NBR and relevant authority. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Bangladeshi practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
