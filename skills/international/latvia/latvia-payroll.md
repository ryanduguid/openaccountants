The 2025 PIT reform took effect 1 January 2025: the income-tested differentiated non-taxable minimum was abolished and replaced with a fixed EUR 510/month minimum, and the prior three-rate PIT was replaced with the two-rate 25.5%/33% system. (Source: Ministry of Finance, "Changes in taxation and finances from 2025"; Lex & Finance.)

## Section 2 -- Personal Income Tax Withholding (IIN)

The employer acts as the tax agent: it withholds personal income tax (IIN) and the employee's share of state social insurance (VSAOI) from gross monthly salary, and remits both to VID's single tax account. The employer adds its own VSAOI share on top of gross.

### PIT Rates (2025) — progressive at ANNUAL reconciliation, flat 25.5% withheld MONTHLY

VID applies the progressive PIT scale to **annual** income; the higher rates are settled on the annual income declaration. Employers withhold a **flat 25.5% monthly** regardless of the monthly amount. (Source: VID "Personal Income Tax rates" — "25.5% — monthly income"; "income under EUR 105,300 — 25.5%, income from EUR 105,300 — 33%"; PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Latvia.)

| Annual taxable income (EUR) | Rate | Withheld monthly by employer? |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 105,300 | 25.5% | Yes — flat 25.5% on each month's taxable base. Same EUR 105,300 figure is the VSAOI annual cap. |
| Above 105,300 | 33% | **No.** Settled on the annual income declaration the following year; monthly payroll still withholds 25.5%. |
| Above 200,000 total annual income | +3% surtax (on the excess, on top of 33%) | **No.** Annual income declaration only. |

> **There is no monthly EUR 8,775 PIT bracket.** EUR 8,775 ≈ 105,300/12 is only the monthly *equivalent* of the annual band boundary; it is NOT a statutory monthly withholding threshold. Monthly payroll always withholds at 25.5%; the 33% and +3% are annual-reconciliation items. (Source: VID "Personal Income Tax rates"; PwC.)

### Monthly Withholding Method

Monthly PIT is withheld on **taxable income**, computed as:

```
Taxable income = Gross monthly salary
                 - employee VSAOI (10.50% of gross)
                 - non-taxable minimum (if wage tax book held — see Section 5)
                 - applicable allowances (dependant / disability / repressed)

Monthly PIT withheld = 25.5% × taxable income   (flat, all months)
```

The 33% rate (annual income above EUR 105,300) and the +3% surtax (annual income above EUR 200,000) are reconciled by the individual on the annual income declaration (gada ienākumu deklarācija); they are NOT applied in routine monthly payroll. (Source: VID; PwC.)

> **Order of operations note:** employee VSAOI is deducted from gross *before* PIT is computed; the non-taxable minimum and allowances are then subtracted from the post-VSAOI amount. Always confirm sequencing for edge cases with the reviewer. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact statutory ordering of VSAOI vs. non-taxable-minimum deduction in the monthly base.]

---

## Section 3 -- State Social Insurance -- Employee Deductions (VSAOI)

The employee VSAOI share is withheld by the employer from gross salary before PIT and remitted with the employer share.

### Employee VSAOI Rates (2025)

| Employee category | Employee rate | Base | Floor | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard (fully insured, below state pension age) | 10.50% | Gross salary before PIT | None for standard employees | EUR 105,300/year |
| Reached state pension age / granted old-age pension | 9.25% | Gross salary before PIT | None | EUR 105,300/year |

(Source: VSAA "On contributions"; MindLink national social insurance rates 2025; PwC.)

Income above the EUR 105,300 annual cap is no longer subject to ordinary VSAOI — it falls under the solidarity-tax mechanism (Section 4 / Section 9).

---

## Section 4 -- State Social Insurance -- Employer Contributions (VSAOI) + Solidarity Tax

The employer pays its VSAOI share on top of gross salary.

### Employer VSAOI Rates (2025)

| Employee category | Employer rate | Combined (employer + employee) | Base | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard (fully insured, below state pension age) | 23.59% | 34.09% (23.59% + 10.50%) | Gross salary before PIT | EUR 105,300/year |
| Reached state pension age / granted old-age pension | 20.77% | 30.02% (20.77% + 9.25%) | Gross salary before PIT | EUR 105,300/year |

(Source: VSAA "On contributions"; MindLink 2025; PwC. 1 percentage point of the total funds health/healthcare services.)

### Business Risk State Fee (uzņēmējdarbības riska valsts nodeva)

| Item | Amount | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Business risk state fee | **EUR 0.36 per employee per month** | Paid solely by the employer for each person in an employment relationship (excluding seasonal agricultural workers under that special regime). Funds the Employee Claims Guarantee Fund. **Unchanged at EUR 0.36 for both 2025 and 2026.** Paid by the 23rd of the following month with PIT + VSAOI. |

(Source: VID; Cabinet Regulation 2025; mkd.gov.lv "Business risk state fee unchanged in 2026"; ifinanses 2026.) This is a flat per-head amount, NOT a percentage of wages, and is part of total employer cost.

> [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] The retirement-age split (employer 20.77% / employee 9.25% = 30.02%) is published by PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Latvia, "Other taxes") and MindLink's 2025 rate table. VSAA's own page states only the combined standard 34.09% and notes rates vary by insured-person status without publishing the per-category percentages; the per-category distribution should still be confirmed against the current Cabinet Regulation on VSAOI rate distribution.

### Solidarity Tax (solidaritātes nodoklis)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Applies to | Income exceeding the EUR 105,300/year VSAOI cap |
| Withheld during year | Full 34.09% VSAOI rate is withheld on income above the cap |
| Year-end reconciliation | VID reconciles down to an **effective 25%** solidarity tax rate (legislated since 2021); the difference is refunded/reconciled |
| Administered by | VID |

(Source: lexfinance.lv; PwC; VSAA.) In routine monthly payroll, continue applying the full VSAOI rate above the cap; the reconciliation to the effective 25% rate is an annual / VID-driven process, not a payroll-run adjustment.

---

## Section 5 -- Non-Taxable Minimum, Allowances, Minimum Wage

### Fixed Non-Taxable Minimum and Allowances (2025)

| Item | Monthly | Annual | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fixed non-taxable minimum | EUR 510 | EUR 6,120 | Fixed for all employees regardless of income (differentiated minimum abolished from 1 Jan 2025). Applied only if the employee has filed their wage tax book with this employer. |
| Pensioner non-taxable minimum | EUR 1,000 | EUR 12,000 | Old-age pensioners; EUR 1,000/month for both 2025 and 2026. (Source: Ministry of Finance "Non-taxable minimum and tax allowances".) |
| Dependant allowance (per dependant) | EUR 250 | EUR 3,000 | Per dependant (typically children); unchanged since 2021. Applied only by the employer holding the wage tax book. |
| Additional allowance — disability Group I and II | EUR 154 | EUR 1,848 | — |
| Additional allowance — disability Group III | EUR 120 | EUR 1,440 | — |
| Additional allowance — politically repressed persons / national resistance participants | EUR 154 | EUR 1,848 | — |

(Source: Ministry of Finance "Non-taxable minimum and tax allowances" and "Changes 2025"; VSAA pension minimum 2025; lexfinance.lv.)

> **Critical:** The non-taxable minimum and ALL allowances can be applied at payroll only by the employer holding the employee's **wage tax book (algas nodokļa grāmatiņa)**. If the wage tax book is not filed with this employer, withhold WITHOUT them (see Conservative Defaults).

### National Minimum Wage (2025)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Statutory minimum monthly wage (gross) | EUR 740/month, effective 1 January 2025 |

(Source: Ministry of Welfare; Cabinet of Ministers; Eurofound. Rises to EUR 780/month from 1 January 2026 — do NOT use the 2026 figure for a 2025 computation.)

### Minimum VSAOI Contribution Base

A minimum monthly VSAOI object equal to the minimum wage (EUR 740/month) applies. If an employee's reported monthly VSAOI income is below EUR 740, the **employer must pay top-up minimum contributions** on the shortfall, assessed quarterly by VSAA. Statutory exceptions apply (e.g. first 3 months of employment, multiple employers, disability, students). (Source: VSAA; payroll guides.)

> [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to detail] The full list of minimum-contribution exemptions (first months of employment, multiple-employer aggregation, disability, students) should be confirmed against the current statute by the reviewer.

The self-employed / voluntary minimum annual VSAOI base for 2025 is 12 × EUR 740 = **EUR 8,880/year** (not applicable to standard employed payroll; included for cross-reference).

---

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When information is missing, default to the treatment that does NOT under-withhold:

| Assumption | Conservative default |
|---|---|
| Non-taxable minimum applied | **EUR 0** unless the employee has filed their wage tax book (algas nodokļa grāmatiņa) with this employer. The EUR 510/month minimum and EUR 250/dependant allowance can only be applied at the employer holding the wage tax book. |
| Standard VSAOI rate | Use **23.59% employer + 10.50% employee (34.09% total)** for a standard fully-insured employee below state pension age. Switch to 20.77% + 9.25% only when retirement-age status is confirmed. |
| Income vs. VSAOI cap | Apply full VSAOI on the whole salary up to **EUR 105,300/year**; only above the cap does the solidarity-tax treatment apply. |
| PIT rate (monthly) | Withhold a **flat 25.5%** on the monthly taxable base for all employees. Do NOT apply 33% in monthly payroll (it is an annual-reconciliation item keyed to annual income above EUR 105,300), and do not pre-apply the 3% surtax. |
| Dependant / disability allowance | EUR 0 unless documented and the wage tax book is held by this employer. |
| Business risk state fee | Always **EUR 0.36 per employee per month** (employer only); add to every employee's total employer cost. |

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

Before computing Latvia payroll, you MUST have:

1. **Gross monthly salary** (EUR).
2. **Wage tax book status** — is the algas nodokļa grāmatiņa filed with THIS employer? (Determines whether the non-taxable minimum and allowances apply.)
3. **Employee age / pension status** — has the employee reached state pension age or been granted an old-age pension? (Determines 34.09% vs. 30.02% VSAOI.)
4. **Number of dependants** (for the EUR 250/dependant allowance) — only if the wage tax book is held here.
5. **Disability / repressed-person status** (for additional allowances) — only if documented and wage tax book held here.
6. **Year-to-date gross** — needed to track the EUR 105,300 annual VSAOI cap (which also marks where annual PIT moves from 25.5% to 33% at the annual declaration). Monthly withholding stays at 25.5% regardless.

### Refusal Catalogue — STOP and ask before computing if:

| Missing / ambiguous | Why it blocks computation |
|---|---|
| Wage tax book status unknown | Cannot decide whether to apply the EUR 510 minimum and allowances; defaulting wrong over-/under-withholds materially. |
| Pension-age status unknown for an older worker | Wrong VSAOI rate (34.09% vs. 30.02%). |
| Salary near or above EUR 105,300/year | VSAOI cap, the 25.5%→33% annual band change, and solidarity-tax interaction all trigger — confirm YTD figures. (Monthly withholding still 25.5%; the 33% is annual.) |
| Sub-minimum-wage salary | Minimum-contribution top-up may be due; confirm exemptions. |
| Claimed allowances without documentation | Allowances require the wage tax book and supporting status. |
| Request to apply the 3% surcharge or solidarity reconciliation in monthly payroll | These are annual / VID-driven, not payroll-run items — clarify scope. |

Never guess any of the above. State the assumption, label outputs as estimates, and direct to a licensed accountant.

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All examples use 2025 figures. **Estimates only — not professional advice.** "Wage tax book held" means the algas nodokļa grāmatiņa is filed with this employer (so the non-taxable minimum and allowances apply).

### Example 1 — Standard single employee, wage tax book held, no dependants

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 2,000**
- Wage tax book held here: yes → apply EUR 510 non-taxable minimum
- Below pension age → VSAOI 34.09% (employer 23.59% / employee 10.50%)

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 2,000 × 10.50% | 210.00 |
| PIT base | 2,000 − 210.00 − 510 (minimum) | 1,280.00 |
| PIT | 1,280.00 × 25.5% (flat monthly rate) | 326.40 |
| Net pay | 2,000 − 210.00 − 326.40 | **1,463.60** |
| Employer VSAOI | 2,000 × 23.59% | 471.80 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 2,000 + 471.80 + 0.36 | **2,472.16** |

Bank statement: `ALGA PĀRSKAITĪJUMS EUR 1,463.60` to employee; later `VID VIENOTAIS NODOKĻU KONTS` debit covering PIT EUR 326.40 + total VSAOI EUR 681.80; separate `UZŅĒMĒJDARBĪBAS RISKA VALSTS NODEVA EUR 0.36`.

### Example 2 — Same salary, NO wage tax book filed here

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 2,000**
- Wage tax book held here: no → non-taxable minimum = EUR 0 (Conservative Default)

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 2,000 × 10.50% | 210.00 |
| PIT base | 2,000 − 210.00 − 0 | 1,790.00 |
| PIT | 1,790.00 × 25.5% | 456.45 |
| Net pay | 2,000 − 210.00 − 456.45 | **1,333.55** |
| Employer VSAOI | 2,000 × 23.59% | 471.80 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 2,000 + 471.80 + 0.36 | **2,472.16** |

Note the EUR 130.05 difference in net pay vs. Example 1 — driven solely by whether the wage tax book is filed here. This is why wage tax book status is a required input.

### Example 3 — Employee with one dependant, wage tax book held

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 1,500**
- Wage tax book held here: yes → EUR 510 minimum + EUR 250 dependant allowance
- Below pension age → 34.09% VSAOI

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 1,500 × 10.50% | 157.50 |
| PIT base | 1,500 − 157.50 − 510 − 250 | 582.50 |
| PIT | 582.50 × 25.5% | 148.54 |
| Net pay | 1,500 − 157.50 − 148.54 | **1,193.96** |
| Employer VSAOI | 1,500 × 23.59% | 353.85 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 1,500 + 353.85 + 0.36 | **1,854.21** |

### Example 4 — Minimum-wage employee, wage tax book held

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 740** (2025 statutory minimum)
- Wage tax book held here: yes → EUR 510 minimum

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 740 × 10.50% | 77.70 |
| PIT base | 740 − 77.70 − 510 | 152.30 |
| PIT | 152.30 × 25.5% | 38.84 |
| Net pay | 740 − 77.70 − 38.84 | **623.46** |
| Employer VSAOI | 740 × 23.59% | 174.57 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 740 + 174.57 + 0.36 | **914.93** |

At exactly the minimum wage the minimum VSAOI contribution base is met, so no employer top-up is due. If the salary were below EUR 740 (e.g. part-month), check the quarterly minimum-contribution rule (Section 5).

### Example 5 — Retirement-age employee

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 1,800**
- Pension age reached → VSAOI 30.02% (employer 20.77% / employee 9.25%)
- Wage tax book held here: yes → EUR 1,000 pensioner non-taxable minimum (2025)

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 1,800 × 9.25% | 166.50 |
| PIT base | 1,800 − 166.50 − 1,000 | 633.50 |
| PIT | 633.50 × 25.5% | 161.54 |
| Net pay | 1,800 − 166.50 − 161.54 | **1,471.96** |
| Employer VSAOI | 1,800 × 20.77% | 373.86 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 1,800 + 373.86 + 0.36 | **2,174.22** |

> The 30.02% split is reviewer-pending (see Section 4 RESEARCH GAP).

### Example 6 — High earner (monthly withholding stays flat 25.5%)

- Gross monthly salary: **EUR 10,000**
- Wage tax book held here: yes (EUR 510 minimum)
- Below pension age → 34.09% VSAOI; on a single month this is well within the EUR 105,300 annual cap, so full VSAOI applies

| Step | Computation | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|
| Employee VSAOI | 10,000 × 10.50% | 1,050.00 |
| PIT base | 10,000 − 1,050.00 − 510 | 8,440.00 |
| PIT withheld @ 25.5% | 8,440.00 × 25.5% (flat monthly rate) | 2,152.20 |
| Net pay | 10,000 − 1,050.00 − 2,152.20 | **6,797.80** |
| Employer VSAOI | 10,000 × 23.59% | 2,359.00 |
| Business risk state fee | flat, per employee | 0.36 |
| Total employer cost | 10,000 + 2,359.00 + 0.36 | **12,359.36** |

Monthly payroll withholds a flat 25.5% on the taxable base regardless of how high the monthly salary is — there is no monthly 33% bracket. The 33% rate is only applied at the annual income declaration on **annual** income above EUR 105,300, and the +3% surtax on annual income above EUR 200,000 is likewise an annual-declaration item. Track YTD gross against the EUR 105,300 VSAOI cap; once annual income exceeds it, VSAOI is reconciled to the solidarity-tax treatment (see Section 4) and annual PIT moves into the 33% band — but neither changes the in-year 25.5% monthly withholding. (Source: VID "Personal Income Tax rates"; PwC.)

15. Employers file the monthly **Darba devēja ziņojums** (Employer's Report) via VID EDS by the **17th** of the following month, and pay PIT + VSAOI + the business risk fee by the **23rd**. (VID due dates.)
16. New employees must be registered with VID **at least 1 hour before work starts** (electronic, EDS) or **1 day before** (paper); status changes / terminations reported within **3 days**. (VID; EURES; VDI.)
17. Late payment incurs late-payment interest (nokavējuma nauda) on the overdue amount; commonly cited as **0.05% per day** but the current statutory daily rate must be confirmed with VID at filing time. [RESEARCH GAP — confirm current daily rate under the Law On Taxes and Fees with VID.]

## Section 11 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

These items require a Latvian-licensed accountant's judgement and are flagged for sign-off:

| Item | Why it needs reviewer judgement |
|---|---|
| Retirement-age VSAOI split (20.77% / 9.25%) | Sourced from MindLink 2025; VSAA emphasises the combined rate. Confirm per-category distribution against the Cabinet Regulation. [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Minimum-contribution exemptions | First-3-months, multiple-employer, disability and student exemptions must be detailed against current statute. [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Ordering of VSAOI vs. non-taxable minimum in the PIT base | Confirm exact statutory sequencing. [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Annual reconciliation of the 33% band | Monthly payroll withholds flat 25.5% (VID); the 33% band on annual income above EUR 105,300 is settled by the individual on the annual income declaration. Confirm any employer reporting touchpoints for high earners. |
| Penalty amounts | EUR 70–1,100 / EUR 140–700 figures are from secondary payroll-guide summaries of the Administrative Liability Law and Labour Law; verify against current statute. [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Solidarity-tax reconciliation mechanics | Confirm timing and mechanism of VID's reconciliation from 34.09% to effective 25%. |
| Benefits-in-kind, business-trip allowances, and special PIT regimes (e.g. micro-enterprise, seasonal workers) | Out of scope of this base skill; reviewer to confirm interaction. [RESEARCH GAP] |
| Solidarity tax and 3% surcharge at the annual stage | These are individual annual-declaration items; confirm employer reporting touchpoints. |

## Section 12 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested columns for a per-employee monthly payroll working paper (one row per employee per month):

| Column | Content / formula |
|---|---|
| A — Employee | Name / personal code (last 4 masked) |
| B — Wage tax book here? | Yes/No |
| C — Pension age? | Yes/No |
| D — Dependants | Count |
| E — Gross | Gross monthly salary (EUR) |
| F — Employee VSAOI rate | 10.50% or 9.25% (from C) |
| G — Employee VSAOI | `=E*F` |
| H — Non-taxable minimum | 510 if B=Yes & not pensioner; 1,000 if pensioner & B=Yes; else 0 |
| I — Allowances | `=D*250` (+ disability/repressed) if B=Yes; else 0 |
| J — PIT base | `=E-G-H-I` |
| K — Monthly PIT withheld @ 25.5% | `=J*0.255` (flat monthly rate — no monthly 33% bracket; the 33% band is annual only) |
| L — Net pay | `=E-G-K` |
| M — Employer VSAOI rate | 23.59% or 20.77% (from C) |
| N — Employer VSAOI | `=E*M` |

## Section 14 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement is mid-year or records are incomplete:

1. **Confirm wage tax book status** for each employee with this employer (drives minimum + allowances). If unknown, default to EUR 0 minimum/allowances and flag for correction.
2. **Rebuild YTD gross** per employee from prior payslips or prior employer's reports to track the EUR 105,300 annual VSAOI cap (also the 25.5%→33% annual PIT band boundary). Monthly withholding stays at a flat 25.5%.
3. **Confirm pension-age status** for any worker plausibly at or above state pension age (drives 34.09% vs. 30.02%).
4. **Check minimum-contribution top-ups** for any sub-minimum-wage months; review quarterly VSAA assessments.
5. **Reconcile to EDS** — pull prior Darba devēja ziņojums filings and single-tax-account payments; tie out PIT and VSAOI.
6. **Flag all assumptions** and route the reconstructed payroll to a Latvian-licensed accountant before finalising.

If you cannot establish wage tax book status, pension status, or YTD gross, STOP and request them — do not guess.

### Tax-Year Boundary Warning

Several official pages (VSAA contributions, FM allowances) were re-published in late Dec 2025 / Jan 2026 and now display **2026** figures. The following 2026 values must NOT be used for a 2025 computation:
- Minimum wage EUR 780/month (2025 = **EUR 740**)
- Standard non-taxable minimum EUR 550/month (2025 = **EUR 510**)

The pensioner non-taxable minimum is **EUR 1,000/month (EUR 12,000/year) in both 2025 and 2026** (Ministry of Finance), so it is NOT a 2025-vs-2026 difference. (Note: some older guides quoted EUR 500/month for 2025; the authoritative Ministry of Finance figure used here is EUR 1,000/month.)

### Test Suite

Use these to self-check any implementation of this skill (2025 figures):

1. **Standard, wage tax book, EUR 2,000, no dependants** → employee VSAOI 210.00; PIT base 1,280.00; PIT 326.40; net 1,463.60; employer VSAOI 471.80; + business risk fee 0.36 → total employer cost 2,472.16. (Example 1.)
2. **Same EUR 2,000, NO wage tax book** → minimum = 0; PIT base 1,790.00; PIT 456.45; net 1,333.55. (Example 2.)
3. **EUR 1,500, wage tax book, one dependant** → VSAOI 157.50; PIT base 582.50; PIT 148.54; net 1,193.96. (Example 3.)
4. **Minimum wage EUR 740, wage tax book** → VSAOI 77.70; PIT base 152.30; PIT 38.84; net 623.46; no top-up due at exactly EUR 740. (Example 4.)
5. **Retirement age EUR 1,800, wage tax book** → employee VSAOI @ 9.25% = 166.50; pensioner minimum 1,000; PIT base 633.50; PIT 161.54; net 1,471.96; employer VSAOI @ 20.77% = 373.86; + business risk fee 0.36. (Example 5.)
6. **High earner EUR 10,000, wage tax book** → employee VSAOI 1,050.00; PIT base 8,440.00; monthly PIT withheld @ flat 25.5% = 2,152.20; net 6,797.80. (Example 6.)
7. **Flat-monthly-rate check** — confirm monthly payroll withholds 25.5% on the taxable base regardless of monthly amount; the 33% band and +3% surtax are NOT applied in monthly payroll (annual income declaration only). Reject any implementation that applies a 33% rate at a "EUR 8,775/month" threshold — no such monthly bracket exists.
8. **Cap check** — confirm VSAOI stops accruing once YTD gross exceeds EUR 105,300, with above-cap income flagged for solidarity-tax treatment.
9. **Business risk fee check** — EUR 0.36 per employee per month is added to total employer cost only (not withheld from the employee, not a percentage of pay), for both 2025 and 2026.
10. **VSAOI sum check** — confirm 23.59% + 10.50% = 34.09% (standard) and 20.77% + 9.25% = 30.02% (pension-age).
11. **Filing check** — Darba devēja ziņojums due by the 17th; payment (PIT + VSAOI + business risk fee) by the 23rd of the following month.
12. **Registration check** — new employee registered ≥ 1 hour before work starts (electronic).
13. **Late-interest check** — late-payment interest accrues per day on overdue amounts (commonly cited as 0.05%/day; confirm the current rate with VID — see RESEARCH GAP).
14. **2025-vs-2026 guard** — reject EUR 780 minimum wage and EUR 550 standard non-taxable minimum as out-of-year for 2025; the pensioner non-taxable minimum is EUR 1,000/month in BOTH years.

## Section 16 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (PIT withholding + VSAOI) | **This skill (latvia-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed / business-activity income tax | latvia-income-tax.md (when available) |
| Latvia VAT (PVN) returns | latvia-vat-return.md (when available) |
| Latvia bookkeeping | latvia-bookkeeping.md (when available) |
| Employer corporate income tax | latvia-corporate-tax.md (when available) |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and employer VSAOI are expenses; withheld PIT and employee VSAOI are liabilities until remitted to the single tax account.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** The annual income statement issued to the employee feeds their personal annual income declaration, where the 33% bracket and 3% surcharge are reconciled.
- **Payroll → Social Insurance:** VSAOI paid through payroll counts toward the employee's pension and social entitlements; the EUR 105,300 cap and solidarity-tax mechanism govern high earners.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the non-taxable minimum (EUR 510) or any allowance unless the employee's wage tax book (algas nodokļa grāmatiņa) is filed with THIS employer.
- NEVER use 2026 figures (EUR 780 minimum wage, EUR 550 minimum, EUR 1,000 pensioner minimum) for a 2025 computation.
- NEVER compute VSAOI on net or post-PIT salary — VSAOI is on gross before PIT.
- NEVER apply the 33% rate in monthly payroll — monthly withholding is a flat 25.5%; the 33% band (annual income above EUR 105,300) is settled only on the annual income declaration. There is no monthly EUR 8,775 PIT bracket.
- NEVER apply the +3% surtax or the solidarity-tax reconciliation in monthly payroll — these are annual / VID-driven.
- NEVER use the retirement-age VSAOI split (20.77% / 9.25%) without confirming pension-age status.
- NEVER ignore the minimum VSAOI contribution base for sub-minimum-wage employees.
- NEVER omit the business risk state fee (EUR 0.36 per employee per month) from total employer cost.
- NEVER miss the Darba devēja ziņojums deadline (17th) or the payment deadline (23rd) — late interest of 0.05%/day applies.
- NEVER start an employee without VID registration (≥ 1 hour before work, electronic).
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Latvian-licensed accountant.
