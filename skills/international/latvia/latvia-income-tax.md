description: >
  Use this skill whenever asked about Latvia personal income tax (iedzīvotāju ienākuma nodoklis, IIN) for employees, self-employed / economic-activity individuals, pensioners, or capital-income recipients. Trigger on phrases like "how much income tax do I pay in Latvia", "Latvia PIT rate", "gada ienākumu deklarācija", "annual income declaration", "non-taxable minimum", "neapliekamais minimums", "VSAOI", "social contributions Latvia", "solidarity tax", "solidaritātes nodoklis", "micro-enterprise tax", "mikrouzņēmuma nodoklis", "MET", "economic activity registration", "capital gains Latvia", "dividend tax Latvia", "self-employed Latvia tax", "EDS", or any question about filing or computing Latvian personal income tax. Also trigger when preparing or reviewing a Latvian annual income declaration (form GID), a capital-gains return (GD/GDz), or a monthly payroll computation, computing the fixed non-taxable minimum and allowances, or advising on VSAOI / solidarity tax interaction. This skill covers the 25.5% / 33% progressive PIT, the +3% high-income surtax, the fixed non-taxable minimum and allowances, VSAOI rates and bases, the solidarity tax, the micro-enterprise tax regime, capital-income tax, penalties, and the interaction with VAT and social insurance. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Latvian income tax work.

### PIT Rate Brackets (2025 -- annual reconciliation)

PIT is **progressive at annual reconciliation**. Monthly payroll is withheld at the flat **25.5%**; the 33% and +3% bands are settled through the annual income declaration (VID, https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/personal-income-tax-rates).

| Annual income (EUR) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 105,300 | 25.5% | EUR 26,851.50 |
| 105,300 -- 200,000 | 33% | EUR 58,102.50 |
| 200,000+ | 33% + 3% surtax | -- |

- 25.5% on annual income up to EUR 105,300 (VID, https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/personal-income-tax-rates).
- 33% on the portion of annual income above EUR 105,300 (PwC, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/latvia/individual/taxes-on-personal-income).
- An additional **+3% surtax** on the portion of total annual income exceeding EUR 200,000, on top of the 33% rate (VID). PwC notes this first applies via the 2026 tax return (i.e. on 2025 income reconciled in 2026). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact first-application year for payroll vs annual reconciliation.

**Cumulative-tax check:** at EUR 105,300 → 105,300 × 25.5% = **26,851.50**. At EUR 200,000 → 26,851.50 + (200,000 − 105,300) × 33% = 26,851.50 + 94,700 × 33% = 26,851.50 + 31,251.00 = **58,102.50**.

**Latvia has no separate tax-free "personal allowance" band — the fixed non-taxable minimum (below) is deducted from the PIT base instead.**

### Non-Taxable Minimum and Allowances (2025)

| Item | 2025 amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed non-taxable minimum (all employees) | EUR 510/month (EUR 6,120/year) | FM, https://www.fm.gov.lv/en/changes-taxation-and-finances-2025 |
| Pensioner non-taxable minimum | EUR 1,000/month (EUR 12,000/year) | FM, https://www.fm.gov.lv/en/non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances |
| Dependant allowance (per dependant) | EUR 250/month (EUR 3,000/year) | FM, non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances |
| Disability allowance -- Group I/II | EUR 154/month (EUR 1,848/year) | FM, non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances |
| Disability allowance -- Group III | EUR 120/month (EUR 1,440/year) | FM, non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances |
| Politically-repressed persons | EUR 154/month | FM, non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances |

> **2025 vs 2026 caution.** The former differentiated (income-dependent) allowance was abolished from 2025; the fixed EUR 510/month applies uniformly for 2025 (FM "Changes from 2025"). The FM allowances page (updated Jan 2026) shows EUR 550/month — that is the **2026** figure (progression: 510 in 2025 → 550 in 2026 → 570 in 2027). **Use EUR 510 for the 2025 tax year.**

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text), plus confirmation of Latvian tax residency, source of income (employment / economic activity / capital / pension), and whether a wage-tax book (algas nodokļa grāmatiņa) is lodged with the employer.

**Recommended** -- payslips / employer VSAOI records, economic-activity income & expense records, capital transaction records (purchase cost and disposal proceeds), prior-year annual declaration (GID), dependant / disability / pensioner status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, VSAOI payment confirmations, EDS pre-filled data export, and confirmation of any solidarity-tax exposure.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without supporting documents = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify residency, that economic-activity expenses are supported, that the non-taxable minimum / allowances are correctly applied, and that the correct progressive band has been used at annual reconciliation."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-LV-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Latvian PIT depends on tax residency. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming whether the individual is a Latvian tax resident, a non-resident, or dual-resident. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-LV-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals (employees, self-employed / economic-activity persons, capital-income recipients). Companies pay corporate income tax (UIN); partnerships and group structures file separately. Escalate to a Latvian-qualified adviser."

**R-LV-3 -- Non-resident / cross-border income.** "Non-resident taxation, double-tax-treaty relief, and posted-worker rules have different rules. Out of scope. Escalate to a Latvian-qualified adviser."

**R-LV-4 -- Complex capital / property disposals.** "Real-estate disposals, inherited assets, and structured capital transactions require specialised analysis (including the 25.5% capital-gains rate and quarterly reporting interaction). Escalate to a Latvian-qualified adviser."

**R-LV-5 -- Solidarity-tax / high-income reconciliation.** "Income above the EUR 105,300 social-insurance cap triggers solidarity tax (effective 25%, recalculated with refund the following year) and may cross the 33% / +3% PIT bands. This needs reviewer judgement. Escalate before advising."

**R-LV-6 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to VID enforcement. Late-payment interest (0.05%/day, capped at 40% of principal) and understatement penalties (20%/30%) apply. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-LV-7 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Latvian VAT, use the latvia-vat-return skill. For payroll mechanics, use latvia-payroll; for VSAOI detail, latvia-social-contributions."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the statement. Latvian statements frequently use Latvian-language terms (shown in the patterns). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All examples use the 2025 figures: PIT 25.5%, fixed non-taxable minimum EUR 510/month, employee VSAOI 10.50% (employee mandatory social contributions reduce the PIT base under the PIT-law withholding method — confirm with reviewer for edge cases).

### Example 1 -- Monthly Payroll (employee, wage-tax book lodged)

**Input line:**
`15.01.2025 ; SWEDBANK PĀRSKAITĪJUMS ; SIA OZOLS ; ALGA JANVĀRIS ; +1,463.60 ; EUR`

**Scenario:** Gross salary EUR 2,000/month, single, no dependants, wage-tax book lodged so the EUR 510/month non-taxable minimum is applied at source.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee VSAOI: 2,000 × 10.50% = **EUR 210.00**
- Non-taxable minimum: **EUR 510.00**
- PIT base: 2,000 − 210 − 510 = **EUR 1,280.00**
- PIT at 25.5%: 1,280 × 0.255 = **EUR 326.40**
- Net pay: 2,000 − 210 − 326.40 = **EUR 1,463.60**
- Employer VSAOI: 2,000 × 23.59% = **EUR 471.80**; total employer cost = 2,000 + 471.80 = **EUR 2,471.80**

**Classification:** Net employment credit EUR 1,463.60 (Section 3.1 ALGA). The 33%/+3% bands are NOT applied at payroll — only at annual reconciliation.

### Example 2 -- Self-Employed Fee Received (general regime)

**Input line:**
`12.03.2025 ; SEB PĀRSKAITĪJUMS ; SIA BĒRZS ; RĒĶINS NR.2025-014 ; +5,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Payment for services under registered economic activity. If not VAT-registered, full EUR 5,000 is economic-activity income. If VAT-registered (21%), extract the net. Net economic-activity profit (income − allowable expenses) is taxed at 25.5%; VSAOI is payable separately (see Example 3).

**Classification:** Economic-activity income EUR 5,000 (net of VAT if registered).

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed VSAOI Payment

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; SWEDBANK MAKSĀJUMS ; VALSTS KASE VSAOI ; PAŠNODARBINĀTAIS Q1 ; -652.47 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Self-employed VSAOI is 31.07% (29.36% if pension-age) on a freely-chosen object at/above the minimum base where monthly income is EUR 700 or more (VID). This is a social-insurance payment, tracked separately — it is not a Section 3.2 expense line. Example: object EUR 700/month × 3 months = 2,100 × 31.07% = **EUR 652.47**.

**Classification:** VSAOI payment (Section 3.8). Not a PIT deduction line.

### Example 4 -- Dividend Already Subject to CIT

**Input line:**
`20.05.2025 ; CITADELE ; SIA PRIEDE ; DIVIDENDE 2024 ; +5,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Dividend from a Latvian company that has already paid corporate income tax (CIT/UIN) on the underlying profit is **exempt** from PIT (PwC). If the distribution had NOT borne Latvian CIT, the 25.5% capital-income rate would apply.

**Classification:** Capital income EUR 5,000 — **PIT EUR 0.00** (CIT already paid). Confirm CIT status with reviewer.

### Example 5 -- Capital Gain on Share Sale (quarterly threshold)

**Input line:**
`18.06.2025 ; SEB ; BROKER PĀRDOŠANA ; AKCIJAS ; +8,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Shares acquired for EUR 5,000, sold for EUR 8,000. Capital gain = 8,000 − 5,000 = **EUR 3,000**. Capital-gains PIT at 25.5% = 3,000 × 0.255 = **EUR 765.00**. Because the quarterly gain exceeds EUR 1,000, a capital-gains return (GD/GDz) must be filed **quarterly**, by the 15th of the month following the quarter (PwC).

**Classification:** Capital gain EUR 3,000; PIT EUR 765.00; quarterly capital-gains return required.

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`30.05.2025 ; SWEDBANK PĀRSKAITĪJUMS ; PAŠA KONTS - KRĀJUMI ; ; -2,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Transfer between the taxpayer's own accounts. Neither income nor expense.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Progressive PIT at Annual Reconciliation

**Legislation:** Law "On Personal Income Tax".

For 2025: 25.5% on annual income up to EUR 105,300; 33% on the portion above EUR 105,300; an additional 3% surtax on the portion above EUR 200,000 (VID, https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/personal-income-tax-rates). Monthly payroll PIT is withheld at the flat 25.5%; the 33% and +3% are settled through the annual income declaration. The +3% surtax: VID lists it as a 2025 rate, PwC notes first application via 2026 returns — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

### 5.2 Non-Taxable Minimum and Allowances

The fixed non-taxable minimum for 2025 is EUR 510/month (EUR 6,120/year), applied uniformly to all employees (FM, https://www.fm.gov.lv/en/changes-taxation-and-finances-2025). It is applied at payroll only if a wage-tax book (algas nodokļa grāmatiņa) is lodged with the employer. Pensioners: EUR 1,000/month. Dependant allowance: EUR 250/month per dependant. Disability: Group I/II EUR 154/month; Group III EUR 120/month; politically-repressed EUR 154/month (FM, https://www.fm.gov.lv/en/non-taxable-minimum-and-tax-allowances).

### 5.3 PIT Base Computation (employment)

PIT base = gross salary − employee mandatory social contributions (VSAOI) − applicable non-taxable minimum − allowances. PIT (payroll) = PIT base × 25.5%.

> The deductibility of employee VSAOI from the PIT base follows the standard Latvian withholding method (consistent with VID payroll guidance and Baltic practice). Confirm the precise interaction with reviewer for non-standard cases.

### 5.4 Capital Income

Dividends, interest, and capital gains are taxed at a flat 25.5% for 2025 (increased from 20% in 2024). Dividends already subject to Latvian CIT are exempt from PIT (PwC, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/latvia/individual/taxes-on-personal-income).

### 5.5 Mandatory Social Insurance (VSAOI)

| Payer | Standard rate | Pension-age reduced |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 10.50% | 9.25% |
| Employer | 23.59% | 20.77% |
| **Total** | **34.09%** | **30.02%** |

On gross income up to the maximum base of EUR 105,300/year. The employee 10.50% includes 1 percentage point earmarked for healthcare (VSAA, https://www.vsaa.gov.lv/en/contributions-0; PwC for the reduced rate). **Totals check:** 10.50 + 23.59 = 34.09; 9.25 + 20.77 = 30.02.

### 5.6 Self-Employed VSAOI

31.07% (29.36% if pension-age) on a freely-chosen object at/above the minimum base where monthly income is EUR 700 or more. Where monthly income is **below** EUR 700, a 10% contribution to state pension insurance is payable on the actual income (VID, https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/self-employed-persons-individual-entrepreneurs). The interaction between the freely-chosen object, the EUR 740 minimum object, and the 10% low-income contribution is nuanced — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against current VSAA self-employed guidance].**

### 5.7 Solidarity Tax

Applies to income above the EUR 105,300 social-insurance cap. Charged at 34.09% during the year and recalculated to an **effective 25%**, with the over-collected amount above 25% refunded to the employer by 1 September of the following year (Grant Thornton, https://www.grantthornton.lv/en/insights/key-tax-rates-in-latvia-2025/). It replaces uncapped social contributions for high earners.

### 5.8 Minimum Wage and Minimum Contributions

Minimum monthly wage is EUR 740 from 1 January 2025 (was EUR 700 in 2024) (Cabinet of Ministers, https://www.mk.gov.lv/en/article/national-minimum-wage-amount-740-euros-next-year). The minimum social-insurance object = minimum wage; minimum quarterly base = 3 × minimum wage = EUR 2,220 for 2025 (VSAA). If an employee's wage is below the minimum, the employer must top up contributions to the minimum base.

### 5.9 Micro-Enterprise Tax (MET)

A single combined payment (covering VSAOI + the owner's PIT) at **25% of turnover** (VID, https://www.vid.gov.lv/en/microenterprise-tax). Available only where turnover stays within the VAT-registration threshold (EUR 50,000); minimum MET is EUR 50 if no/low turnover. An older tiered 25%/40% structure (40% above EUR 25,000 turnover) appeared in pre-2024 rules — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm no turnover-tier rate applies for 2025 against the current Micro-Enterprise Tax Law text].**

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Standard employee, below cap, full-year allowance.**
Input: Employment income EUR 30,000/year, single, no dependants, wage-tax book lodged.
Expected: Annual EE VSAOI 30,000 × 10.50% = EUR 3,150.00; non-taxable minimum 510 × 12 = EUR 6,120.00; PIT base = 30,000 − 3,150 − 6,120 = EUR 20,730.00; PIT 25.5% = 20,730 × 0.255 = **EUR 5,286.15**.

**Test 2 -- High earner crossing the EUR 105,300 band.**
Input: Taxable income (post-allowance) EUR 150,000.
Expected: 105,300 × 25.5% = 26,851.50; (150,000 − 105,300) × 33% = 44,700 × 33% = 14,751.00; total PIT = **EUR 41,602.50**.

**Test 3 -- Surtax above EUR 200,000.**
Input: Total annual income EUR 250,000.
Expected: 105,300 × 25.5% = 26,851.50; (250,000 − 105,300) × 33% = 144,700 × 33% = 47,751.00; +3% surtax on (250,000 − 200,000) = 50,000 × 3% = 1,500.00; total = **EUR 76,102.50**. (Confirm +3% first-application year — see RESEARCH GAP in 5.1.)

**Test 4 -- Self-employed below EUR 700/month.**
Input: Self-employed, monthly income EUR 500.
Expected: 10% pension contribution on actual income = 500 × 10% = **EUR 50.00/month**; plus 25.5% PIT on net economic-activity profit. (Not the full 31.07% VSAOI.)

**Test 5 -- Capital gain, quarterly threshold.**
Input: Quarterly capital gain EUR 1,500 (proceeds 8,000, cost 6,500).
Expected: Gain 1,500; PIT 25.5% = 1,500 × 0.255 = **EUR 382.50**; quarterly capital-gains return required (gain > EUR 1,000).

**Test 6 -- Dividend already subject to CIT.**
Input: EUR 5,000 dividend from a Latvian company that paid CIT.
Expected: **PIT EUR 0.00** (exempt). If no Latvian CIT had been paid: 5,000 × 25.5% = EUR 1,275.00.

**Test 7 -- Reduced VSAOI (pension-age employee).**
Input: Gross salary EUR 1,500/month, employee at state old-age-pension age.
Expected: EE VSAOI 1,500 × 9.25% = EUR 138.75; ER VSAOI 1,500 × 20.77% = EUR 311.55; total 1,500 × 30.02% = **EUR 450.30**.

**Test 8 -- Solidarity tax (above the cap).**
Input: Annual income EUR 130,000 (above the EUR 105,300 social-insurance cap).
Expected: Income above EUR 105,300 = EUR 24,700 subject to solidarity tax; charged at 34.09% during the year and recalculated to an effective 25%, with the over-collection refunded to the employer by 1 September of the following year. Escalate (R-LV-5).

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute Latvian PIT without confirming tax residency
- NEVER apply the 33% or +3% bands at monthly payroll -- payroll is flat 25.5%, the higher bands settle at annual reconciliation
- NEVER use EUR 550 as the 2025 non-taxable minimum -- that is the 2026 figure; 2025 is EUR 510/month
- NEVER auto-apply the non-taxable minimum at payroll unless a wage-tax book is lodged
- NEVER tax a Latvian-CIT-bearing dividend at 25.5% -- it is PIT-exempt
- NEVER deduct employee work expenses against employment income -- deductions apply to economic-activity income only
- NEVER treat the micro-enterprise 25% as allowing expense deductions -- it is on turnover
- NEVER ignore the EUR 105,300 social-insurance cap or the solidarity-tax interaction for high earners
- NEVER state a numeric rate/threshold/deadline without an inline citation or a [RESEARCH GAP] marker
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated, Tier-2, pending professional sign-off
