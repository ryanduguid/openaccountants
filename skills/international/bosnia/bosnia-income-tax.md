  Use this skill whenever asked about Bosnia and Herzegovina personal income tax (porez na dohodak) for employees or self-employed individuals. Trigger on phrases like "how much tax do I pay in Bosnia", "FBiH income tax", "Republika Srpska income tax", "Brcko District tax", "porez na dohodak", "doprinosi", "social contributions Bosnia", "net pay BAM", "personal allowance", "lichni odbitak", "godisnja poreska prijava", "minimum wage Bosnia", "VAT registration UINO", "PDV", or any question about computing or filing personal income tax and payroll contributions for a B&H worker or sole trader. CRITICAL: Bosnia has NO single national income tax — there are three separate entity/district systems (FBiH, RS, Brcko District). ALWAYS determine the taxpayer's entity FIRST. Also trigger when reviewing a monthly payroll specification (MIP-1023 / Obrazac 1002) or an annual return (GPD-1051). ALWAYS read this skill before touching any B&H income tax work.

# Bosnia and Herzegovina Income Tax -- Personal/Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified).** Confidence: medium. Figures are sourced from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (2025), the FBiH Official Gazette / Orbitax / Unija legislative summaries, WageIndicator, and the Indirect Taxation Authority (UINO). Several figures carry explicit `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` markers and MUST be confirmed against the entity-level statutes before filing.

## Section 0 -- READ THIS FIRST: There Is No National Income Tax

Bosnia and Herzegovina does **NOT** levy a single national personal income tax. Direct taxes (personal income tax and social contributions) are administered **at the entity/district level** by three separate systems with different rates, allowances, and contribution structures:

| System | Authority | PIT rate | Website |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Federation of B&H (FBiH)** | Porezna uprava FBiH (Tax Administration of the Federation) | Flat **10%** | www.pufbih.ba |
| **Republika Srpska (RS)** | Poreska uprava RS (Tax Administration of RS) | Flat **8%** | www.poreskaupravars.org |
| **Brčko District (BD)** | Brčko District Tax Administration | Flat **10%** | — |

Indirect tax (VAT / PDV) is the **only** state-level direct-revenue tax, administered by the **Indirect Taxation Authority (Uprava za indirektno oporezivanje / UINO)** at **17%** (www.uino.gov.ba).

**You MUST determine the taxpayer's entity before computing anything.** If the entity is unknown, see the Conservative Defaults (Section 1) — default to FBiH and flag for the reviewer.

### Personal Income Tax Rates (2025)

All three systems use **flat** rates (no progressive brackets — there is no "cumulative tax" table to compute).

| Jurisdiction | Type | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Federation of B&H (FBiH) | Flat | **10%** | Taxable personal income (worldwide for residents; FBiH-source for non-residents) |
| Republika Srpska (RS) | Flat | **8%** | Taxable personal income |
| Republika Srpska — small entrepreneurs (paušalci) | Flat lump-sum on revenue | **2%** | Total annual revenue, if below the qualifying threshold |
| Brčko District (BD) | Flat | **10%** | Taxable personal income |

Source: PwC, *Individual – Taxes on personal income* (2025). **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the qualifying annual-revenue threshold for the RS 2% paušal regime, and whether it is elective or mandatory — not confirmed from an authoritative source.

### Personal Allowances (2025)

| Jurisdiction | Personal allowance | Dependent additions |
|---|---|---|
| FBiH | **300 BAM/month** (3,600 BAM/year) | Spouse +150/mo; 1st child +150/mo; 2nd child +270/mo; 3rd+ child +90/mo each; dependent parent (income ≤300 BAM/mo) +90/mo |
| RS | **6,000 BAM/year** (500 BAM/month) | Dependent family members +900 BAM/year each; mortgage interest fully deductible; life insurance and voluntary pension contributions up to 1,200 BAM each |
| BD | **6,000 BAM/year** (500 BAM/month) | **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** BD dependent allowances not separately captured |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown entity (FBiH / RS / BD) | Default to **FBiH** (larger by population); apply 10% PIT + FBiH allowances/contributions. FBiH 10% > RS 8%, so this avoids understating tax. Flag for reviewer. |
| FBiH employer cost, date unknown in 2025 | Use period-appropriate rate: ~10.5% social-fund total **before** 1 July 2025; 5.0% **from** 1 July 2025 |
| RS individual, paušal status unconfirmed | Default to **8% standard** rate, NOT the 2% lump-sum regime |
| Unknown dependents | Apply personal allowance only (no dependent additions) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT registration | Assume not registered until turnover confirmed ≥ 100,000 BAM |

## Section 1A -- Social Contribution Tables (doprinosi)

> **Arithmetic note:** every "total" row below is the exact sum of its component rows. Verify before relying on it.

### FBiH Contributions (% of gross salary)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer (from 1 July 2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Pension and disability insurance | 17.0% | 2.5% (reduced from 6.0%) |
| Health insurance | 12.5% | 2.0% (reduced from 4.0%) |
| Unemployment insurance | 1.5% | 0.5% (unchanged) |
| **TOTAL on gross** | **31.0%** | **5.0%** |

Plus two employer levies **on net salary** (not gross):

| Employer levy (base = net salary) | Rate |
|---|---|
| Protection from natural and other disasters | 0.5% |
| Water protection charge | 0.5% |

Component check (employee): 17.0 + 12.5 + 1.5 = **31.0%** ✓
Component check (employer social funds): 2.5 + 2.0 + 0.5 = **5.0%** ✓

Source: PwC, *Individual – Other taxes* (2025), https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/bosnia-and-herzegovina/individual/other-taxes; employer reduction per Unija/Orbitax (Official Gazette FBiH, 7 May 2025; effective 1 July 2025).

**Pre-1 July 2025 employer rates** (for H1 2025 computations): pension/disability 6.0%, health 4.0%, unemployment 0.5% = ~10.5% (social-fund total cited variously as 10.0% on the three funds, or ~10.5% including the two 0.5% net-salary levies). **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the exact pre-July employer total against the entity Law on Contributions text.

### RS Contributions (% of gross salary) — employee bears ALL

| Contribution | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| Pension and disability insurance | 18.5% | 0% |
| Health insurance | 12.0% | 0% |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.6% | 0% |
| Child protection | 1.7% | 0% |
| **TOTAL on gross** | **32.8%** | **0%** |

Component check: 18.5 + 12.0 + 0.6 + 1.7 = **32.8%** ✓

Source: PwC, *Individual – Other taxes* (2025). RS has **no** employer social contributions; the employee carries the full 32.8%.

### Brčko District Contributions

| Contribution | Detail |
|---|---|
| Pension | Employee may elect to contribute to **either** the RS or FBiH pension fund; rate depends on the chosen fund |
| Health insurance | **12.0%** of gross |

Source: PwC, *Individual – Other taxes* (2025). **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the exact BD employer/employee split, which follows the chosen entity fund.

### Contribution Base Notes (self-employed / entrepreneurs)

FBiH self-employed/entrepreneur contribution bases are set by **coefficient multiples of the published average salary** (e.g. ~1.1 liberal professions, 0.65 crafts, 0.55 without books, 0.29 sole traders with books). The monthly base BAM amounts are published annually by the Federal Minister of Finance by 31 December. **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the exact 2025 BAM base figures from the official Službene novine — not obtained. No explicit monthly contribution ceiling was confirmed for either entity for 2025; the minimum base is effectively tied to the minimum wage. Source: PwC (2025) + caveats.

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — the taxpayer's **entity** (FBiH / RS / BD), gross monthly salary or annual income, and number/type of dependents.

**Recommended** — full-year payslips or bank statement, monthly payroll specifications (MIP-1023 / Obrazac 1002), confirmation of resident vs non-resident status, prior-year annual return, and (for self-employed) the contribution base/coefficient applied.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure records, asset register, deductible items (RS mortgage interest, life-insurance / voluntary-pension up to 1,200 BAM each), VAT registration status (UINO), and confirmation of period for any H1/H2 2025 employer-rate split.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No entity = hard stop (the rate, allowances, and contributions differ entirely between systems). Income without supporting documents = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from limited data. The reviewer must verify the entity, contribution base, and allowable deductions."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-BA-1 — Entity unknown.** "Bosnia and Herzegovina has three separate income-tax systems (FBiH, RS, Brčko District) with different rates (10% / 8% / 10%), allowances, and contributions. This skill cannot compute tax without the taxpayer's entity. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-BA-2 — RS small-entrepreneur (paušal) regime.** "The RS 2% lump-sum regime is threshold-gated and the qualifying revenue limit is unconfirmed. Do not apply 2% without confirming eligibility. Default to 8% standard and escalate to a B&H adviser."

**R-BA-3 — Non-resident / cross-border income.** "Non-resident and dual-residence taxation, and inter-entity allocation, have different rules. Out of scope. Escalate to a B&H tax adviser."

**R-BA-4 — Capital gains / property disposals.** "Capital gains and property-transfer taxation require specialised entity-level analysis. Escalate to a B&H tax adviser."

**R-BA-5 — Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax/contribution arrears or is subject to enforcement. Default interest and entity-specific fines apply. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-BA-6 — VAT / PDV return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax and payroll contributions only. B&H VAT is a separate state-level tax under UINO. Use a dedicated VAT skill."

**R-BA-7 — Mid-2025 FBiH employer-rate period unknown.** "FBiH employer contributions changed on 1 July 2025. For an employer-cost computation, confirm whether the period is before or after that date before applying a rate."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

> All figures recomputed end-to-end below. BAM throughout.

### Example 1 — FBiH minimum-wage employee (sanity check)

**Input:** Single FBiH employee, gross 1,562 BAM/month (2025 minimum wage gross), no dependents.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee contributions: 31.0% × 1,562 = **484.22**
- Income after contributions: 1,562 − 484.22 = **1,077.78**
- Personal allowance: 300
- PIT base: 1,077.78 − 300 = **777.78**
- PIT @ 10%: 777.78 × 0.10 = **77.78**
- **Net pay: 1,077.78 − 77.78 = 1,000.00**

**Cross-check:** This reconciles to the published FBiH 2025 minimum wage of **1,000 BAM net** (WageIndicator). ✓
Source: WageIndicator, *Minimum Wage FBiH from 01 Jan 2025*; PwC (2025).

### Example 2 — FBiH single employee, gross 3,000 BAM

**Input:** Single FBiH employee, gross 3,000 BAM/month, no dependents. Payment date in H2 2025 (employer rates from 1 July 2025).

**Reasoning (employee side):**
- Employee contributions: 31.0% × 3,000 = **930.00**
- After contributions: 3,000 − 930 = **2,070.00**
- Personal allowance: 300 → PIT base: 2,070 − 300 = **1,770.00**
- PIT @ 10%: **177.00**
- **Net pay: 2,070 − 177 = 1,893.00**

**Employer cost (from 1 July 2025):**
- Social funds 5.0% × 3,000 = **150.00**
- Natural-disaster levy 0.5% × net 1,893 = **9.47**
- Water protection 0.5% × net 1,893 = **9.47**
- **Total employer cost ≈ 3,000 + 150 + 9.47 + 9.47 = 3,168.94**

**`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the exact base for the two 0.5% levies ("net salary" definition). Source: PwC (2025); Unija (eff. 1 July 2025).

### Example 3 — FBiH married employee, 2 children, gross 4,000 BAM

**Input:** Married FBiH employee, gross 4,000 BAM/month, spouse dependent, 2 children.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee contributions: 31.0% × 4,000 = **1,240.00**
- After contributions: 4,000 − 1,240 = **2,760.00**
- Allowances: personal 300 + spouse 150 + 1st child 150 + 2nd child 270 = **870.00**
- PIT base: 2,760 − 870 = **1,890.00**
- PIT @ 10%: **189.00**
- **Net pay: 2,760 − 189 = 2,571.00**

Source: PwC, *Deductions* (2025) for the dependent allowance schedule.

### Example 4 — RS single employee, gross 2,000 BAM

**Input:** Single RS employee, gross 2,000 BAM/month. RS has NO employer contributions.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee contributions: 32.8% × 2,000 = **656.00**
- After contributions: 2,000 − 656 = **1,344.00**
- Personal allowance: 6,000/year = 500/month → PIT base: 1,344 − 500 = **844.00**
- PIT @ 8%: 844 × 0.08 = **67.52**
- **Net pay: 1,344 − 67.52 = 1,276.48**
- **Employer cost: 2,000.00** (gross only — RS employer contributions = 0%)

Source: PwC, *Other taxes* and *Deductions* (2025).

### Example 5 — RS small entrepreneur (2% lump-sum)

**Input:** RS sole trader confirmed eligible for the paušal regime, total annual revenue 50,000 BAM.

**Reasoning:**
- Lump-sum PIT @ 2% × 50,000 = **1,000.00** for the year.

**WARNING:** Apply 2% ONLY if paušal eligibility is confirmed. **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** the qualifying revenue threshold and whether the regime is elective. If unconfirmed, default to RS standard 8%. Source: PwC (2025).

### Example 6 — Entity unknown (conservative default)

**Input:** Gross 3,000 BAM/month, entity NOT stated.

**Reasoning:** Default to **FBiH** (10%, larger entity, higher of 10% vs RS 8% — avoids understating tax). Compute as Example 2: net pay **1,893.00**. Flag: "Entity assumed FBiH under conservative default — reviewer must confirm; RS would yield a different result (8% PIT, 32.8% employee contributions, no employer contributions)."

Source: PwC (2025) per Conservative Defaults (Section 1).

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Determine the Entity First

No computation is valid without the entity. FBiH = 10% PIT + 31.0% employee / 5.0% employer (H2 2025) contributions. RS = 8% PIT + 32.8% employee / 0% employer. BD = 10% PIT + 12% health + elective RS/FBiH pension. Source: PwC (2025).

### 5.2 Residence and Source

FBiH residents are taxed on **worldwide** income; non-residents on **FBiH-source** income. Confirm residence before applying worldwide treatment. Source: PwC, *Taxes on personal income* (2025).

### 5.3 PIT Base = Income − Contributions − Allowances

The PIT base is gross income reduced by mandatory employee social contributions and the applicable personal/dependent allowances. Apply the flat entity rate to the resulting base. (See Worked Examples for the order of operations.)

### 5.4 Personal and Dependent Allowances

| Entity | Personal | Dependents |
|---|---|---|
| FBiH | 300/mo | Spouse 150; 1st child 150; 2nd child 270; 3rd+ child 90 each; dependent parent (income ≤300/mo) 90 |
| RS | 6,000/yr | Family members 900/yr each; mortgage interest (full); life insurance + voluntary pension up to 1,200 each |
| BD | 6,000/yr | **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** |

Source: PwC, *Deductions* (2025).

### 5.5 Withholding (PAYE-style)

Employers withhold PIT and employee contributions monthly and remit them with salary. FBiH: salary-tax specification due the same day as payment, no later than 1 day after. RS: monthly specification due by the **10th** of the following month. Source: PwC, *Tax administration* (2025).

### 5.6 FBiH Employer-Rate Change (1 July 2025)

FBiH employer social contributions were cut effective 1 July 2025: pension/disability 6.0% → 2.5%, health 4.0% → 2.0%, unemployment 0.5% unchanged — taking the social-fund total from ~10.0% to 5.0%. The **employee** 31.0% is unchanged and **net pay is unchanged**. Always apply the period-appropriate rate. Source: Unija/Orbitax (Official Gazette FBiH, 7 May 2025).

### 5.7 RS Has No Employer Contributions

In RS the employee bears the full 32.8%; there are no employer social contributions. Source: PwC, *Other taxes* (2025).

### 5.8 Wholly-and-Exclusively (self-employed deductions)

For self-employed/entrepreneur taxpayers, only expenses incurred wholly and exclusively for business are deductible; mixed-use items must be apportioned and documented. Entertainment/representation, personal living costs, fines, and the income tax itself are not deductible. (Apportionment items are Tier 2 — Section 6.)

### 5.9 VAT (PDV) Interaction

VAT is state-level (UINO) at **17%**, single rate, no reduced rate. Registration threshold is **100,000 BAM** annual taxable turnover (raised from 50,000 BAM on 2 Dec 2023); non-resident digital-service (ESS) suppliers register via a VAT representative at the same 100,000 BAM threshold. VAT collected on sales is not income; recoverable input VAT is not an expense. Source: UINO; vatcalc; Deloitte (2025).

### 5.10 Annual Returns and Deadlines

| Entity | Return | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| FBiH | Annual PIT return (GPD-1051 / godišnja prijava poreza na dohodak) | **31 March** of following year |
| RS | Annual income tax return (godišnja poreska prijava) | **31 March** of following year |
| BD | Annual PIT return (only where withholding insufficient) | **28 February** of following year |

Source: PwC, *Tax administration* (2025). **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`** exact form codes against the current entity authority forms.

### 5.11 Monthly Payroll Specifications

| Entity | Form | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| FBiH | Monthly salary tax/contributions specification (Specifikacija MIP-1023) | Same day as salary payment, no later than 1 day after |
| RS | Monthly salary tax/contributions specification (Obrazac 1002) | By the 10th of the following month |

Source: PwC, *Tax administration* (2025). Form codes drawn from common practice — **`[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`**.

### 5.12 Corporate Context (incorporation comparison)

Corporate income tax is **10%** across FBiH, RS, and BD — relevant when a self-employed individual considers incorporation. Source: PwC, *Corporate – Taxes on corporate income* (2025).

- **Conservative default:** 0% until reviewer confirms the arrangement.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only business-use % of fuel, insurance, maintenance, depreciation is deductible; requires a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until log provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; reasonable documented estimate required.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until confirmed.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — FBiH minimum wage reconciliation.**
Input: FBiH, single, gross 1,562 BAM, no dependents.
Expected: contributions 484.22; after-contributions 1,077.78; allowance 300; base 777.78; PIT 77.78; **net 1,000.00** (matches published net minimum wage).

**Test 2 — FBiH single, gross 3,000.**
Input: FBiH, single, gross 3,000, H2 2025.
Expected: contributions 930.00; after 2,070.00; base 1,770.00; PIT 177.00; **net 1,893.00**. Employer cost ≈ 3,168.94 (150 social + 9.47 + 9.47 levies).

**Test 3 — FBiH married, 2 children, gross 4,000.**
Input: FBiH, married, spouse + 2 children, gross 4,000.
Expected: contributions 1,240.00; after 2,760.00; allowances 870.00 (300+150+150+270); base 1,890.00; PIT 189.00; **net 2,571.00**.

**Test 4 — RS single, gross 2,000.**
Input: RS, single, gross 2,000.
Expected: contributions 656.00; after 1,344.00; allowance 500; base 844.00; PIT @8% 67.52; **net 1,276.48**. Employer cost 2,000.00 (RS employer = 0%).

**Test 5 — RS paušal 2%.**
Input: RS sole trader, confirmed paušal, revenue 50,000.
Expected: PIT 2% × 50,000 = **1,000.00**. Only if eligibility confirmed — else default to 8%.

**Test 6 — Entity unknown.**
Input: gross 3,000, entity not stated.
Expected: default FBiH → net 1,893.00; flag entity assumption for reviewer (RS would differ: 8% PIT, 32.8% employee, 0% employer).

**Test 7 — VAT threshold.**
Input: sole trader, annual taxable turnover 120,000 BAM.
Expected: above 100,000 BAM → VAT registration required with UINO at 17%. (Out of scope for PIT computation — escalate per R-BA-6.)

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute B&H income tax without first confirming the entity (FBiH / RS / Brčko District) — the systems differ entirely.
- NEVER apply the RS 2% paušal rate without confirming eligibility and the revenue threshold.
- NEVER apply post-1-July-2025 FBiH employer rates to an H1 2025 period (or vice versa).
- NEVER add RS employer social contributions — RS has none (employee bears 32.8%).
- NEVER treat B&H as having a single national income tax.
- NEVER allow entertainment/representation, personal living costs, fines, or income tax itself as a deduction.
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales as income, or recoverable input VAT as an expense.
- NEVER present any figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP]` as confirmed — flag it for the reviewer.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and require professional sign-off.
