  Use this skill whenever asked about Bosnia and Herzegovina payroll processing for employed persons. Trigger on phrases like "Bosnia payroll", "BiH payroll", "FBiH payroll", "Republika Srpska payroll", "RS payroll", "Brcko payroll", "plata", "neto placa", "bruto placa", "doprinosi", "PIO doprinos", "zdravstveno osiguranje", "porez na dohodak", "personal income tax Bosnia", "social contributions BiH", "employer SSC Bosnia", "minimum wage Bosnia", "najniza placa", "porezna kartica", "Specifikacija uz isplatu placa", "GIP-1022", "gross to net Bosnia", "salary calculation Bosnia", or any question about computing employee pay, withholding tax, or social contributions for Bosnia-based employees. CRITICAL: Bosnia has NO unified national payroll system -- everything is set at the ENTITY level (Federation of BiH, Republika Srpska, Brcko District) with materially different rates, deductions, and forms. This skill branches on the employer's entity. It covers personal income tax (PIT) withholding, social contributions (employee and employer), the 1 July 2025 FBiH contribution reform, minimum wage, personal deductions, and filing obligations. ALWAYS read this skill before processing any Bosnia and Herzegovina payroll.

# Bosnia and Herzegovina Payroll Skill v0.1

> Tier 2 (research-verified). Confidence: **medium**. Bosnia and Herzegovina has no single national payroll authority -- payroll, PIT, and social contributions are administered at the **entity** level. This skill MUST branch on the employer's entity (FBiH / Republika Srpska / Brcko District) before any computation. Where a figure could not be pinned to a primary source it is marked **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]**.

## Section 2 -- ENTITY DETERMINATION (do this FIRST)

Before any calculation, determine the entity in which the employee works / the employer is registered. Everything downstream (PIT rate, contribution split, personal deduction, forms, deadlines) depends on it.

| If the employer / workplace is in... | Use entity | PIT | Employee SSC | Employer SSC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Federation of BiH (Sarajevo, Mostar, Tuzla, Zenica, Bihac, the 10 cantons) | **FBiH** | 10% flat | 31.0% | 5.0% (from 1 Jul 2025) + 1.0% on net |
| Republika Srpska (Banja Luka, Bijeljina, Trebinje, Doboj, Prijedor) | **RS** | 8% flat | 31.0% | 0% |
| Brcko District | **Brcko (BD)** | 10% flat | Health 12% + pension to elected fund | per elected fund |

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Individual / Corporate -- Other taxes and Taxes on personal income.

**Conservative default:** if the employee's work entity is unknown, treat the worker under the entity where the **employer is registered**. Rates differ materially, so never average or assume.

---

## Section 3 -- Personal Income Tax (PIT) Withholding

PIT is withheld monthly at source by the employer (pay-as-you-earn via the gross-up "bruto" model). The rate is flat within each entity. PIT is computed on **net income** = gross salary minus employee social contributions minus the basic personal deduction (and dependent deductions, where a valid tax card is on file).

### PIT rates by entity (2025)

| Entity | PIT type | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FBiH | Flat | 10% | Gross − employee SSC (31%) − personal/dependent deductions | PwC, Individual -- Taxes on personal income |
| RS | Flat | 8% (employment); capital gains 13%; small entrepreneurs 2% of annual revenue | Gross − employee SSC (31%) − personal/dependent deductions | PwC, Individual -- Taxes on personal income |
| Brcko District | Flat | 10% | Gross − employee SSC − deductions | PwC, Individual -- Taxes on personal income |

> There are no progressive brackets -- each entity applies a single flat rate, so there is no cumulative-bracket arithmetic to track. The personal deduction is the only tax-free element.

### Basic personal deduction and dependent factors

**FBiH** -- basic personal deduction = coefficient 1 = **300 KM/month (3,600 KM/year)**, applied only via a valid tax card (*porezna kartica*). Dependent factors are applied to the same 300 KM base (Klix.ba salary structure; rif.hr 2025 dependent summary):

| FBiH dependent factor | Multiplier of 300 KM/mo |
|---|---|
| Spouse (supported) | 0.5 |
| 1st child | 0.5 |
| 2nd child | 0.7 |
| 3rd and each further child | 0.9 each |
| Other supported dependent / disability | 0.3 |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** The FBiH 300 KM base and dependent factors were confirmed from a Bosnian tax-press source (Klix.ba) and an accounting summary (rif.hr), not the primary FBiH Pravilnik PDF (the official PUFBiH PDF was not machine-readable in research). Confirm the current base against the FBiH Pravilnik.

**RS** -- basic personal deduction = **12,000 KM/year (1,000 KM/month)**, proportionally reduced for part-time and split across multiple employers; dependent deduction = **1,800 KM/year per dependent family member**; plus a deduction for interest on housing loans (PwC, Individual -- Taxes on personal income).

**Conservative default:** apply the basic personal deduction only where a valid tax card (*porezna kartica*) is on file; otherwise grant no personal deduction (FBiH/RS both require the card to claim it).

---

## Section 4 -- Social Contributions (Federation of BiH)

FBiH contributions are split between employee and employer. **The 1 July 2025 reform cut the combined rate from 41.5% to 36%** (employer side only: PIO 6.0%→2.5%, health 4.0%→2.0%). The employee side (31.0%) was unchanged.

### FBiH contribution table -- from 1 July 2025

| Fund | Employee rate | Employer rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension & disability insurance (PIO) | 17.0% | 2.5% (was 6.0%) | Gross salary | PwC, Corporate -- Other taxes |
| Health insurance | 12.5% | 2.0% (was 4.0%) | Gross salary | PwC, Corporate -- Other taxes |
| Unemployment insurance | 1.5% | 0.5% | Gross salary | PwC, Corporate -- Other taxes |
| **TOTAL social contributions** | **31.0%** | **5.0%** (was 10.5%) | Gross salary | Vlada FBiH / federalna.ba |
| **Combined** | | | **36.0%** (was 41.5%) | Vlada FBiH / federalna.ba |

**Arithmetic check:** employee 17.0 + 12.5 + 1.5 = **31.0%** ✓; employer 2.5 + 2.0 + 0.5 = **5.0%** ✓; combined 31.0 + 5.0 = **36.0%** ✓.

### FBiH employer-borne charges OUTSIDE the 36%

| Charge | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Protection from natural and other disasters | 0.5% | **NET** salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Water protection charge | 0.5% | **NET** salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |

These two 0.5% charges are employer-borne, calculated on **net** salary, and sit **outside** the 36% combined SSC rate.

### FBiH pre-1-July-2025 rates (for first-half-2025 payroll)

| Fund | Employer rate (pre-reform) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| PIO | 6.0% | Nexo / PwC |
| Health | 4.0% | Nexo / PwC |
| Unemployment | 0.5% | Nexo / PwC |
| **Employer total (pre-reform)** | **10.5%** | federalna.ba |
| **Combined (pre-reform)** | **41.5%** | federalna.ba |

**Conservative default:** for FBiH payroll dated **on/after 1 Jul 2025** use 5.0% employer / 36% combined; for periods **before** that date use 10.5% employer / 41.5% combined.

---

## Section 5 -- Social Contributions (Republika Srpska)

In RS there are **NO employer social contributions**. All **32.8%** is borne by the employee and withheld by the employer.

### RS contribution table

| Fund | Employee rate | Employer rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension & disability insurance (PIO) | 18.5% | 0% | Gross salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Health insurance | 12.0% | 0% | Gross salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Child protection | 1.7% | 0% | Gross salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.6% | 0% | Gross salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| **TOTAL social contributions** | **32.8%** | **0%** | Gross salary | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |

**Arithmetic check:** employee 18.5 + 12.0 + 1.7 + 0.6 = **32.8%** ✓; employer = **0%** ✓.

> **Source note:** RS employee contributions confirmed against PwC, *Bosnia and Herzegovina -- Individual -- Other taxes* (pension/PIO 18.5%, health 12.0%, unemployment 0.6%, child protection 1.7%; total 32.8%) and the 2025 Eurofast Bosnia payroll guide. RS is an entirely employee-borne regime: PwC states "There are no employer's social security contributions in Republika Srpska."

### Brcko District

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Health insurance | 12% | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Pension | Employee **elects** to contribute to either the RS or FBiH PIO fund (rate per chosen entity) | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |
| Employer | Per the chosen entity | PwC, Individual -- Other taxes |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Full Brcko District contribution mechanics and form codes were not pinned to a single authoritative figure. Confirm against the Brcko District Tax Administration before relying on Brcko output.

## Section 6 -- Minimum Wage (2025)

| Entity | Net (KM/mo) | Gross (KM/mo) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FBiH | 1,000.00 | 1,562 | 1 Jan -- 31 Dec 2025; Sl. novine FBiH 104/24 | Vlada FBiH |
| RS -- base | 900.00 | 1,344.26 | Sl. glasnik RS 6/25 | Plastron |
| RS -- 3-yr secondary | 950.00 | 1,426.23 | By qualification tier | Plastron |
| RS -- 4-yr secondary | 1,000.00 | 1,508.20 | By qualification tier | Plastron |
| RS -- higher education | 1,300.00 | 2,000.00 | By qualification tier | Plastron |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Contribution **floors** (lowest base, often a percentage of the entity average wage for part-time/low earners) exist in both entities but exact 2025 base amounts were not pinned to a primary source. Confirm the lowest-base rule for low/part-time earners before finalising such payroll.

---

## Section 7 -- Conservative Defaults

When information is missing or ambiguous, apply the most defensible (least aggressive) treatment and flag it:

1. **Unknown entity → use employer's registration entity.** Never average FBiH/RS/Brcko rates. (Rationale: BiH has no unified payroll system; entity determines everything.)
2. **FBiH date logic.** On/after 1 Jul 2025: employer 5.0% / combined 36%. Before that: employer 10.5% / combined 41.5%. (Rationale: mid-year 2025 reform.)
3. **No tax card → no personal deduction.** Apply the basic/dependent personal deduction only with a valid *porezna kartica* on file. (Rationale: FBiH/RS require the card.)
4. **Net-figure mismatch → present mechanics, flag the figure.** Where a published "net" minimum differs from a mechanical gross-to-net (see RS examples), show the computation and mark the published figure for reviewer confirmation rather than back-solving.
5. **Penalty bands → flag, do not invent.** Cite that fines + default interest apply but do not state a specific KM band unless confirmed (see Section 13).

---

## Section 8 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Entity (FBiH / RS / Brcko) | Determines every rate, deduction, and form |
| Pay period (month/year) | FBiH reform changes rates from 1 Jul 2025 |
| Gross OR net salary (state which) | Gross-up "bruto" model needs the starting basis |
| Tax card (*porezna kartica*) status + dependents | Determines personal/dependent deductions |
| Employee age / qualification (RS) | RS minimum wage is tiered by qualification |
| Employment type (full/part-time) | Affects deduction proration and floor base |

### Refusal catalogue -- DO NOT compute if:

- The **entity is unknown** and the employer registration cannot be established → ask; do not guess.
- The user asks for a **single "Bosnia" rate** that ignores the entity split → explain the entity model first.
- A **pre-1-Jul-2025 FBiH** computation is requested without confirming the pay date → ask for the date.
- The user requests **Brcko** pension treatment without stating the elected fund → ask which fund (RS or FBiH).
- The user wants a **definitive net figure** where research data shows a published/mechanical mismatch → present the mechanics and flag for accountant review.

## Section 9 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Use these patterns to classify Bosnian bank-statement lines deterministically. Terms are in local language (Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian, Latin and Cyrillic both occur).

### Salary credits (employee side)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| PLATA, PLACA, ZARADA, ISPLATA PLACE | Net salary payment |
| NETO PLATA, NETO PLACA | Net salary payment |
| AKONTACIJA PLACE, AVANS PLATE | Salary advance (net) |
| ПЛАТА, ЗАРАДА (Cyrillic) | Net salary payment (RS) |
| REGRES, TOPLI OBROK | Allowance (vacation / meal) -- check taxability |

### Employer debit patterns (remittances)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| POREZ NA DOHODAK, POREZ NA DOHOTAK | PIT withheld, remitted to PUFBiH/PURS |
| DOPRINOSI, DOPRINOS PIO, MIO | Pension contribution (PIO/MIO) remittance |
| ZDRAVSTVENO, ZDRAVSTVENO OSIGURANJE | Health insurance contribution remittance |
| NEZAPOSLENOST, OSIGURANJE OD NEZAPOSLENOSTI | Unemployment contribution remittance |
| DJECIJA ZASTITA, DJECJA ZASTITA (RS) | Child-protection contribution (RS) |
| ZASTITA OD PRIRODNIH NESRECA | FBiH disaster-protection 0.5% (on net) |
| VODNE NAKNADE, VODNA NAKNADA | FBiH water charge 0.5% (on net) |
| PUFBIH, PORESKA UPRAVA | Remittance to FBiH/RS tax administration |

### Deterministic classification rules

1. If statement text matches a **contribution fund name** (PIO/MIO, ZDRAVSTVENO, NEZAPOSLENOST, DJECIJA ZASTITA) → contribution liability remittance, not an expense reclassification.
2. If text contains **POREZ NA DOHODAK/DOHOTAK** → PIT withholding remittance (liability until paid).
3. If text contains **ZASTITA OD PRIRODNIH** or **VODN-** → FBiH employer-borne 0.5% charge on net (expense, outside the 36%).
4. Cyrillic-script lines almost always indicate an **RS** employer/employee → confirm entity = RS.

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All examples use BAM (KM). Each is recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- FBiH, minimum wage, no dependents (on/after 1 Jul 2025)

Bank statement line: `ISPLATA PLACE — 06/2025 — 1.000,00 KM`

- Gross = **1,562.00 KM** (FBiH 2025 gross minimum; Vlada FBiH)
- Employee SSC = 31% × 1,562.00 = **484.22 KM**
- Income after SSC = 1,562.00 − 484.22 = **1,077.78 KM**
- Basic personal deduction (coeff 1) = **300.00 KM**
- PIT base = 1,077.78 − 300.00 = **777.78 KM**
- PIT = 10% × 777.78 = **77.78 KM**
- **Net pay = 1,077.78 − 77.78 = 1,000.00 KM** ✓ (reconciles to the published 1,000 KM net minimum)
- Employer SSC = 5% × 1,562.00 = **78.10 KM**
- Disaster 0.5% × net 1,000.00 = 5.00 KM; Water 0.5% × net 1,000.00 = 5.00 KM
- **Total employer cost = 1,562.00 + 78.10 + 5.00 + 5.00 = 1,650.10 KM**

### Example 2 -- FBiH, gross 2,000 KM, no dependents (on/after 1 Jul 2025)

Bank statement line: `PLATA 07/2025`

- Gross = **2,000.00 KM**
- Employee SSC = 31% × 2,000.00 = **620.00 KM**
- After SSC = 2,000.00 − 620.00 = **1,380.00 KM**
- Personal deduction = **300.00 KM**
- PIT base = 1,380.00 − 300.00 = **1,080.00 KM**
- PIT = 10% × 1,080.00 = **108.00 KM**
- **Net pay = 1,380.00 − 108.00 = 1,272.00 KM**
- Employer SSC = 5% × 2,000.00 = **100.00 KM**
- Disaster 0.5% × net 1,272.00 = 6.36 KM; Water 0.5% × net 1,272.00 = 6.36 KM
- **Total employer cost = 2,000.00 + 100.00 + 6.36 + 6.36 = 2,112.72 KM**

### Example 3 -- FBiH, gross 2,000 KM, PRE-reform (Feb 2025)

Bank statement line: `ISPLATA PLACE 02/2025`

- Gross = **2,000.00 KM**
- Employee SSC = 31% × 2,000.00 = **620.00 KM** (employee side unchanged)
- After SSC = **1,380.00 KM**; deduction 300.00 → PIT base 1,080.00; PIT = **108.00 KM**
- **Net pay = 1,272.00 KM** (employee outcome identical to Example 2)
- Employer SSC = **10.5%** × 2,000.00 = **210.00 KM** (pre-reform)
- Disaster + Water = 6.36 + 6.36 = 12.72 KM
- **Total employer cost = 2,000.00 + 210.00 + 12.72 = 2,222.72 KM** (110.00 KM higher employer cost than post-reform Example 2)

### Example 4 -- RS, gross 1,508.20 KM (4-yr secondary minimum), no dependents

Bank statement line (Cyrillic): `ПЛАТА 09/2025`

- Gross = **1,508.20 KM**
- Employee SSC = 31% × 1,508.20 = **467.54 KM** (1,508.20 × 0.31 = 467.542)
- After SSC = 1,508.20 − 467.54 = **1,040.66 KM**
- RS personal deduction = 1,000.00 KM/month
- PIT base = 1,040.66 − 1,000.00 = **40.66 KM**
- PIT = 8% × 40.66 = **3.25 KM**
- **Net pay = 1,040.66 − 3.25 = 1,037.41 KM**
- Employer SSC = **0.00 KM** (no employer contributions in RS)
- **Total employer cost = 1,508.20 KM** (gross only)

> Note: the published RS "net" for this tier is 1,000.00 KM, but the mechanical gross-to-net above yields 1,037.41 KM. Per Conservative Default 4, present the mechanics and flag the published-figure reconciliation. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the exact RS net-definition / deduction-application order against PURS.

### Example 5 -- RS, gross 2,000 KM (higher-education minimum), one dependent

Bank statement line: `ZARADA 10/2025`

- Gross = **2,000.00 KM**
- Employee SSC = 31% × 2,000.00 = **620.00 KM**
- After SSC = 2,000.00 − 620.00 = **1,380.00 KM**
- RS personal deduction (1,000.00/mo) + 1 dependent (1,800.00/yr ÷ 12 = 150.00/mo) = **1,150.00 KM**
- PIT base = 1,380.00 − 1,150.00 = **230.00 KM**
- PIT = 8% × 230.00 = **18.40 KM**
- **Net pay = 1,380.00 − 18.40 = 1,361.60 KM**
- Employer SSC = **0.00 KM**
- **Total employer cost = 2,000.00 KM**

### Example 6 -- FBiH, gross 3,000 KM, married + 2 children (on/after 1 Jul 2025)

Bank statement line: `ISPLATA PLACE 08/2025`

- Gross = **3,000.00 KM**
- Employee SSC = 31% × 3,000.00 = **930.00 KM**
- After SSC = 3,000.00 − 930.00 = **2,070.00 KM**
- Personal deduction = coeff 1 (300.00) + spouse 0.5 (150.00) + 1st child 0.5 (150.00) + 2nd child 0.7 (210.00) = **810.00 KM**
- PIT base = 2,070.00 − 810.00 = **1,260.00 KM**
- PIT = 10% × 1,260.00 = **126.00 KM**
- **Net pay = 2,070.00 − 126.00 = 1,944.00 KM**
- Employer SSC = 5% × 3,000.00 = **150.00 KM**
- Disaster 0.5% × net 1,944.00 = 9.72 KM; Water 0.5% × net 1,944.00 = 9.72 KM
- **Total employer cost = 3,000.00 + 150.00 + 9.72 + 9.72 = 3,169.44 KM**

## Section 11 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic -- always apply)

1. **Branch on entity first.** FBiH, RS, and Brcko have different rates, deductions, and forms (PwC).
2. **FBiH PIT = 10% flat** on (gross − 31% employee SSC − deductions) (PwC).
3. **RS PIT = 8% flat** on employment income (gross − 31% employee SSC − deductions); capital gains 13%; small entrepreneurs 2% of revenue (PwC).
4. **Brcko PIT = 10% flat** (PwC).
5. **FBiH employee SSC = 31.0%** = PIO 17.0 + health 12.5 + unemployment 1.5 (PwC).
6. **FBiH employer SSC = 5.0% from 1 Jul 2025** = PIO 2.5 + health 2.0 + unemployment 0.5; was 10.5% before (PwC / Nexo / Vlada FBiH).
7. **FBiH combined fell 41.5% → 36% on 1 Jul 2025** (Vlada FBiH / federalna.ba).
8. **FBiH employer also pays 0.5% disaster + 0.5% water on NET**, outside the 36% (PwC).
9. **RS SSC = 31.0% all employee-borne** = PIO 18.5 + health 10.2 + child 1.7 + unemployment 0.6; **no employer SSC** in RS (PwC).
10. **FBiH personal deduction = 300 KM/mo (coeff 1)** via tax card; RS = 1,000 KM/mo + 1,800 KM/yr per dependent (Klix.ba / rif.hr / PwC).
11. **FBiH 2025 minimum wage = 1,000 net / 1,562 gross** (Sl. novine FBiH 104/24; Vlada FBiH).
12. **RS 2025 minimum wage = 900 net / 1,344.26 gross base**, tiered to 1,300 net / 2,000 gross for higher education (Sl. glasnik RS 6/25; Plastron).
13. **Annual PIT return due 31 March** of the following year (FBiH and RS); Brcko 28 February, waived if fully withheld (PwC).
14. **BAM pegged 1 EUR = 1.95583 BAM** (currency board), so KM figures are stable against EUR.

## Section 12 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These require professional judgement -- present the computation but route to a BiH accountant:

| Item | Why judgement is needed |
|---|---|
| Contribution **floor / lowest base** for part-time and low earners | Exact 2025 base amounts not pinned to a primary source **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| RS net-figure reconciliation (published vs mechanical) | Deduction-application order unclear (see Example 4) **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Brcko District pension fund election (RS vs FBiH) | Employee election drives rates; mechanics not fully confirmed **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Taxability of allowances (*topli obrok*, *regres*, travel) | Non-taxable thresholds vary by entity; not researched here |
| FBiH dependent-factor base (300 KM) | Confirmed from press/accounting sources, not the primary Pravilnik **[RESEARCH GAP]** |
| Cross-entity employees (work split FBiH/RS) | Apportionment and double-card handling needs adviser input |
| 2026 rate continuity (RS new PIT law from 1 Jan 2025) | Confirm no further 2026 change before applying to 2026 periods |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Precise FBiH/RS monthly-specification form codes (e.g. FBiH AUG-1031 / MIP-1023, RS form codes) were NOT confirmed from a single authoritative source. Verify against the PUFBiH and PURS official form catalogues.

### Penalties

| Type | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late / non-payment of withheld PIT and contributions | Entity tax laws impose monetary fines on employers plus default interest on overdue amounts; KM ranges are set in the FBiH/RS Law on Tax Administration and contributions laws | PwC, Individual -- Tax administration |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Exact KM fine bands were not confirmed from a single authoritative figure. State that fines + default interest apply, but do not quote a specific band unless verified.

## Section 14 -- Excel Working Paper Template

Recommended monthly payroll working paper (one row per employee). Build formulas off the **Entity** cell so the same sheet handles FBiH and RS.

| Col | Field | Formula / Source |
|---|---|---|
| A | Employee | input |
| B | Entity | input (FBiH / RS / Brcko) |
| C | Pay period | input (e.g. 2025-08) |
| D | Gross (KM) | input |
| E | Employee SSC rate | `=IF(B="FBiH",0.31,IF(B="RS",0.31,0))` |
| F | Employee SSC | `=D*E` |
| G | Income after SSC | `=D-F` |
| H | Personal deduction | `=IF(B="FBiH",300,IF(B="RS",1000,0))` + dependent factors |
| I | PIT base | `=MAX(0,G-H)` |
| J | PIT rate | `=IF(B="FBiH",0.10,IF(B="RS",0.08,0.10))` |
| K | PIT | `=I*J` |
| L | Net pay | `=G-K` |
| M | Employer SSC rate | `=IF(B="FBiH",IF(C>="2025-07",0.05,0.105),0)` |
| N | Employer SSC | `=D*M` |
| O | FBiH disaster (0.5% net) | `=IF(B="FBiH",L*0.005,0)` |
| P | FBiH water (0.5% net) | `=IF(B="FBiH",L*0.005,0)` |
| Q | Total employer cost | `=D+N+O+P` |

Cross-foot check: column L (net) for an FBiH minimum-wage row must equal 1,000.00 when D=1,562 and H=300.

## Section 15 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

| Local term (Latin / Cyrillic) | English | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Plata / Placa / Plaća / Плата | Salary | "Placa" common in FBiH (Croatian usage); "Plata"/"Зарада" in RS |
| Bruto / Бруто | Gross | The "bruto" model grosses up from net |
| Neto / Нето | Net | Take-home pay |
| Doprinosi / Доприноси | (Social) contributions | The 31% employee block |
| PIO / MIO / ПИО | Pension & disability insurance | "MIO" = mirovinsko/invalidsko (FBiH Croatian) |
| Zdravstveno osiguranje / Здравствено | Health insurance | |
| Osiguranje od nezaposlenosti | Unemployment insurance | |
| Djecija zastita / Дјечија заштита | Child protection | RS-only 1.7% |
| Porez na dohodak / dohotak | Personal income tax | "dohodak" RS, "dohotak" usage varies |
| Porezna kartica / Пореска картица | Tax card | Required to claim personal deduction |
| Najniza placa / najmanja plata | Minimum wage | |
| Zastita od prirodnih nesreca | Disaster protection | FBiH 0.5% on net |
| Vodne naknade | Water charge | FBiH 0.5% on net |

**Tip:** Cyrillic script on a statement is a strong signal the employer/employee is in **Republika Srpska** -- confirm entity = RS and use the RS rate set.

---

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you cannot establish the basics, ask the client (do not guess):

1. In which **entity** is the employee employed -- Federation of BiH, Republika Srpska, or Brcko District?
2. What is the **pay period** (month and year)? (Critical for FBiH: rates changed 1 Jul 2025.)
3. Is the figure provided **gross or net**?
4. Is a valid **tax card (*porezna kartica*)** on file, and how many dependents (spouse/children/others)?
5. (RS) What is the employee's **qualification tier** (for minimum-wage checks)?
6. (Brcko) Which **pension fund** has the employee elected -- RS or FBiH?

If the entity cannot be confirmed, default to the **employer's registration entity** and flag the assumption.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute Bosnia payroll without first establishing the **entity** (FBiH / RS / Brcko).
- NEVER apply a single "Bosnia" rate -- there is no unified national payroll system.
- NEVER use FBiH employer 5.0% / 36% combined for periods **before 1 Jul 2025** (use 10.5% / 41.5%).
- NEVER charge **employer SSC in RS** -- there is none (all 31% is employee-borne).
- NEVER forget the FBiH **0.5% disaster + 0.5% water** charges on NET (outside the 36%).
- NEVER apply the personal deduction without a valid **tax card (*porezna kartica*)** on file.
- NEVER quote a specific **penalty KM band** or **form code** that is marked [RESEARCH GAP] without verifying against PUFBiH/PURS.
- NEVER back-solve a published "net" figure where the mechanics disagree -- present the computation and flag it.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a BiH licensed accountant.
