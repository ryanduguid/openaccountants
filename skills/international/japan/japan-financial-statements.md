## Section 2 -- Reporting Framework

| Entity type | Applicable standard |
|---|---|
| All Stock Companies (株式会社) — Companies Act | J-GAAP (会社計算規則 basis) |
| Listed companies — FIEA | J-GAAP, IFRS, US GAAP, or modified IFRS (Japan's modified international standards) |
| Large Company (大会社) | J-GAAP with mandatory external audit |
| Small and Medium Companies (中小企業) | 中小企業の会計に関する指針 (SME Accounting Guidelines) or 中小企業の会計に関する基本要領 |
| Consolidated (listed) | J-GAAP or IFRS (choice for listed companies) |

### J-GAAP vs IFRS adoption in Japan

Japan allows a choice of four frameworks for listed companies' consolidated financial statements:
1. J-GAAP (most common)
2. IFRS as issued by IASB
3. US GAAP (legacy — being phased out)
4. Modified International Standards (JMIS — Japan-modified IFRS)

---

## Section 3 -- Size Thresholds

### Large Company (大会社) — Companies Act Art. 2(vi)

A Stock Company is a **Large Company** if either:

| Criterion | Threshold |
|---|---|
| Stated capital (資本金) on latest balance sheet | ≥ JPY 500,000,000 (¥5 billion) |
| Total liabilities (負債の部合計) on latest balance sheet | ≥ JPY 20,000,000,000 (¥200 billion) |

Meeting **either** criterion triggers Large Company status (and mandatory external audit).

### Implications

| Category | Financial auditor required? | Consolidated required? |
|---|---|---|
| Large Company (大会社) | Yes — mandatory (会計監査人) | If has subsidiaries |
| Non-large Stock Company | No (unless voluntarily appointed or articles require) | Not required under Companies Act |
| Listed companies (FIEA) | Yes — mandatory | Yes (consolidated reporting) |
| SME (中小企業) | No | No |
