## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Japan (日本) |
| Tax | Income Tax (所得税) — crypto classified as miscellaneous income (雑所得) |
| Currency | JPY (Japanese Yen) — all values must be converted to JPY at the transaction date |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 January – 31 December) |
| Primary authority | National Tax Agency (NTA / 国税庁) FAQ on Crypto Assets (暗号資産に関する税務上の取扱いについて(FAQ)); Income Tax Act (所得税法); NTA Individual Return Notice No. 1600 |
| Tax authority | National Tax Agency (国税庁 / NTA) |
| Filing portal | e-Tax (国税電子申告・納税システム) or paper filing at tax office |
| Maximum combined rate | 55% (45% national income tax + 10% local inhabitant tax) |
| Reconstruction surtax | 2.1% on national income tax (through 2037) |
| De minimis filing threshold | ¥200,000 — salary earners with crypto miscellaneous income below this do not need to file a final return (but local inhabitant tax return is still required) |
| Cost basis method | Total average method (総平均法, default for individuals) or moving average method (移動平均法) — must notify NTA of choice |
| Reporting | Kakutei Shinkoku (確定申告) — final tax return |

| Loss carry-forward | NOT PERMITTED for miscellaneous income |
| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by a Japanese licensed tax accountant (税理士) |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Key Principle

Crypto in Japan is classified as **miscellaneous income (雑所得 / zatsu shotoku)** under aggregate taxation (総合課税 / sōgō kazei). It is **NOT** classified as capital gains (譲渡所得), which means:
- Progressive income tax rates apply (up to 45% + 10% local = 55%)
- Crypto does NOT benefit from the separate ~20% taxation (分離課税) that applies to stock/securities trading
- Losses cannot be carried forward

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown cost basis | Zero (maximises gain) — STOP if material |
| Unknown cost basis method | Total average method (総平均法) — the statutory default for individuals |
| Unknown whether business or miscellaneous income | Miscellaneous income (雑所得) — this is the NTA's default classification |
| Unknown FMV at receipt | Use Japanese exchange price (bitFlyer, Coincheck) at time of transaction |
| Multiple income sources besides salary | Aggregate all miscellaneous income; file if total > ¥200,000 |

---

## Section 2 — Classification Rules

### Income Classification for Crypto

| Classification | When it applies | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Miscellaneous income (雑所得) | Default for individual crypto trading, staking, mining, DeFi | Aggregate taxation at progressive rates |
| Business income (事業所得) | Only if crypto activity constitutes a "business" (organized, continuous, substantial) | Aggregate taxation; blue return deduction possible; losses offset other income |
| Employment income (給与所得) | Salary paid in crypto | Subject to withholding; employer obligations |

**NTA position (FAQ 2-2):** Crypto gains are principally classified as miscellaneous income (other) unless the activity clearly constitutes a business under established criteria.

### Business vs Miscellaneous Income — NTA Criteria

| Factor | Miscellaneous Income | Business Income |
|---|---|---|
| Scale of activity | Personal, occasional | Organised, substantial |
| Continuity | Intermittent | Continuous, systematic |
| Infrastructure | Personal devices | Dedicated office, equipment |
| Livelihood dependency | Side income | Primary source of income |
| Number of transactions | Moderate | Very high volume |

**Conservative default:** Unless the taxpayer can clearly demonstrate business-level activity, classify as miscellaneous income.

## Section 3 — Rate Tables

### National Income Tax Rates (2025)

| Taxable Income | Rate | Deduction Amount |
|---|---|---|
| ¥1 – ¥1,950,000 | 5% | ¥0 |
| ¥1,950,001 – ¥3,300,000 | 10% | ¥97,500 |
| ¥3,300,001 – ¥6,950,000 | 20% | ¥427,500 |
| ¥6,950,001 – ¥9,000,000 | 23% | ¥636,000 |
| ¥9,000,001 – ¥18,000,000 | 33% | ¥1,536,000 |
| ¥18,000,001 – ¥40,000,000 | 40% | ¥2,796,000 |
| Over ¥40,000,000 | 45% | ¥4,796,000 |

Source: Income Tax Act (所得税法) Art. 89; NTA 2025 Individual Income Tax Guide.

### Combined Rates (National + Local Inhabitant Tax)

| Taxable Income | National Rate | Local Rate | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to ¥1,950,000 | 5% | 10% | 15% |
| ¥1,950,001 – ¥3,300,000 | 10% | 10% | 20% |
| ¥3,300,001 – ¥6,950,000 | 20% | 10% | 30% |
| ¥6,950,001 – ¥9,000,000 | 23% | 10% | 33% |
| ¥9,000,001 – ¥18,000,000 | 33% | 10% | 43% |
| ¥18,000,001 – ¥40,000,000 | 40% | 10% | 50% |
| Over ¥40,000,000 | 45% | 10% | 55% |

**Reconstruction surtax (復興特別所得税):** 2.1% of national income tax, applicable through 2037. This increases the effective national rates slightly (e.g., 45% becomes 45% × 1.021 = 45.945%).

### Basic Deduction (基礎控除)

| Taxpayer's Total Income | Basic Deduction |
|---|---|
| Up to ¥24,000,000 | ¥480,000 |
| ¥24,000,001 – ¥24,500,000 | ¥320,000 |
| ¥24,500,001 – ¥25,000,000 | ¥160,000 |
| Over ¥25,000,000 | ¥0 |

## Section 4 — Cost Basis Methods

### Permitted Methods (NTA FAQ 2-4, 2-5)

| Method | Japanese Name | Description | Default? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total average method | 総平均法 (sō heikin hō) | (Opening balance value + total year acquisitions) ÷ (opening quantity + total year acquisitions quantity) = unit cost for the year | YES — default for individuals |
| Moving average method | 移動平均法 (idō heikin hō) | Recalculate average unit cost each time tokens are acquired; use year-end average | Must notify NTA |

**FIFO is NOT available** for individuals in Japan (unlike many other jurisdictions).

### Notification Requirement

- To use moving average method, the taxpayer must file a notification (届出書) with the tax office
- The notification must be filed by the filing deadline of the first return that includes crypto income
- Once elected, the method applies to all tokens of the same type
- Changing method requires another notification and approval

### Total Average Method — Formula

```
Year-end unit cost =
  (Opening balance value + Sum of all acquisition costs during the year)
  ÷ (Opening quantity + Total quantity acquired during the year)

Transfer cost (譲渡原価) = Units sold during the year × Year-end unit cost
```

### Moving Average Method — Formula

```
At each acquisition:
  New average unit cost =
    (Existing holdings value + New acquisition cost)
    ÷ (Existing quantity + New quantity acquired)

Year-end unit cost = Most recent average unit cost as of 31 December
Transfer cost = Units sold during the year × Year-end unit cost
```

### What is included in acquisition cost

- Purchase price in JPY
- Exchange commissions and fees
- Transfer fees directly related to acquisition

Source: NTA FAQ 2-3 (暗号資産の必要経費).

### Deductible Expenses (必要経費)

Beyond the transfer cost (譲渡原価), the following may be deductible:

| Expense | Deductible? |
|---|---|
| Exchange trading fees on sale | Yes |
| Internet/smartphone costs (proportional) | Yes, if directly related to crypto activity |
| Computer/hardware (if > ¥100,000) | Depreciation over useful life |
| Books, research materials | Yes, if directly related |
| Tax software subscription | Yes |
| General living expenses | No |

## Section 5 — DeFi, Staking, Mining, and Airdrops

### 5.1 Mining

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Receipt of mined tokens | Miscellaneous income at FMV (JPY) when mined |
| Cost basis of mined tokens | FMV at receipt (becomes acquisition cost) |
| Deductible expenses | Electricity, hardware depreciation, cooling, rent (proportional) |
| Subsequent sale | Gain/loss calculated under total/moving average from FMV cost basis |

### 5.2 Staking

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Staking rewards received | Miscellaneous income at FMV when received |
| Cost basis of reward tokens | FMV at receipt date |
| Subsequent sale | Gain computed under normal cost basis rules |

### 5.3 Airdrops

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop with FMV at receipt | Miscellaneous income at FMV |
| Airdrop with zero value at receipt | No income on receipt; cost basis = ¥0; full gain on disposal |
| Airdrop requiring action | Income at FMV when claimed |

### 5.4 DeFi Yield / Lending

| Activity | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Interest/yield from lending protocols | Miscellaneous income at FMV when received |
| Liquidity provision (deposit tokens) | May constitute a disposal — exchange of tokens for LP tokens at FMV |
| LP withdrawal | Disposal of LP tokens; gain/loss computed |
| Yield farming rewards | Miscellaneous income at FMV when received |

### 5.5 Hard Forks

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| New tokens from fork | Cost basis = ¥0 (if no acquisition cost); NTA FAQ indicates no income at time of fork if market value is not established |
| Sale of forked tokens | Full proceeds treated as income |

### 5.6 Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps — CRITICAL

**Every crypto-to-crypto swap is a taxable event in Japan.** This is one of the most impactful rules.

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Swap BTC for ETH | Disposal of BTC at FMV of ETH received; gain = FMV of ETH – cost basis of BTC disposed |
| Swap ETH for stablecoin | Same — disposal of ETH |
| Any token exchange | Both sides are taxable events |

Source: NTA FAQ 1-2 (暗号資産で暗号資産を購入した場合).

---

## Section 6 — NFT Treatment

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Purchase of NFT with crypto | Disposal of crypto at FMV; acquisition of NFT at FMV |
| Purchase of NFT with fiat | Acquisition — record cost |
| Sale of NFT | Miscellaneous income (gain = proceeds – cost basis) |
| Creation and primary sale (artist) | Business income or miscellaneous income depending on scale |
| Royalty on secondary sale | Miscellaneous income |
| NFT-for-NFT swap | Disposal of both NFTs at FMV |
| NFT becomes worthless | Loss — cannot carry forward (miscellaneous income limitation) |

---

## Section 7 — Reporting Requirements

### 7.1 Kakutei Shinkoku (確定申告 — Final Tax Return)

| Element | Detail |
|---|---|
| Form | Kakutei Shinkoku-sho (確定申告書) — B form |
| Crypto income section | 雑所得（その他） — Miscellaneous income (Other) |
| Computation sheet | NTA Crypto Calculation Sheet (暗号資産の計算書) — total average version available on NTA website |
| Filing method | e-Tax online or paper at tax office |
| Filing period | 16 February – 15 March of the following year |

### 7.2 The ¥200,000 Threshold

| Taxpayer Type | Filing Required? |
|---|---|
| Salary earner (年末調整 done by employer) with misc. income ≤ ¥200,000 | NO national income tax return required |
| Salary earner with misc. income > ¥200,000 | YES — must file Kakutei Shinkoku |
| Self-employed / business owner | Always required if crypto income exists |
| Salary > ¥20,000,000 | Always required regardless |

**Critical:** Even if the ¥200,000 threshold exempts you from national filing, you **must still file a local inhabitant tax return (住民税の申告)** with your municipality. The ¥200,000 exemption applies ONLY to national income tax.

### 7.3 NTA Crypto Calculation Tool

The NTA provides a downloadable Excel spreadsheet (暗号資産の計算書（総平均法用）) that automates the total average method calculation:
- Available at: nta.go.jp (Publication → Pamphlets → Individual → Crypto)
- Input: transaction history from each exchange
- Output: total income from crypto for the year
- Japanese exchanges (bitFlyer, Coincheck, GMO Coin) provide annual transaction reports (年間取引報告書) that can be directly input

### 7.4 Key Deadlines

| Deadline | Date (CY 2025 income) |
|---|---|
| Tax year end | 31 December 2025 |
| Filing period opens | 16 February 2026 |
| Filing deadline | 15 March 2026 (16 March if 15th falls on weekend/holiday) |
| Payment deadline | 15 March 2026 (or extension via bank transfer — 振替納税 in late April) |
| Local inhabitant tax | Assessed and notified June 2026; paid in 4 installments |

### 7.5 Exchange Reporting

Japanese licensed crypto exchanges (暗号資産交換業者) registered with the Financial Services Agency (FSA / 金融庁) are required to:
- Submit annual transaction reports to the NTA
- Issue annual transaction summaries (年間取引報告書) to users
- Report suspicious transactions

## Section 8 — Loss Offset and Carry-Forward Rules

### The miscellaneous income limitation

| Rule | Detail | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Loss offset within miscellaneous income | Losses within "other miscellaneous income" (その他の雑所得) CAN offset gains within the same sub-category in the same year | Income Tax Act |
| Loss offset against other income categories | **NOT PERMITTED** — miscellaneous income losses cannot offset salary, business, or other income | Income Tax Act Art. 69 |
| Loss carry-forward | **NOT PERMITTED** for miscellaneous income | Income Tax Act Art. 70 |
| Loss carry-back | **NOT PERMITTED** | — |

### Important nuance

Unlike India's regime, Japan **does allow** offsetting losses within the same miscellaneous income (other) sub-category within the same year. So if you lose ¥1,000,000 on BTC and gain ¥1,500,000 on ETH, your net miscellaneous income is ¥500,000. But if your net miscellaneous income for the year is a loss, that loss **cannot** offset salary or other income, and **cannot** be carried forward.

### Business income exception

If crypto activity is classified as **business income** (事業所得), losses CAN:
- Offset other income in the same year (損益通算)
- Be carried forward for 3 years (with blue return / 青色申告)

This is why the business vs miscellaneous income classification matters, but NTA's default is miscellaneous income.

---

## Section 9 — Anti-Avoidance Rules

### 9.1 No Wash Sale Rule

Japan has **no specific wash sale rule** for crypto. You can sell to crystallise a loss within miscellaneous income and immediately rebuy. However, the limited utility of losses (no carry-forward, no cross-category offset) reduces the incentive.

### 9.2 Low-Value / Gratuitous Transfer Rule

| Provision | Effect |
|---|---|
| Transfer at below market value | NTA may deem the transfer at FMV; difference may be treated as gift (贈与税) |
| Gift tax (贈与税) | Gift of crypto valued > ¥1,100,000 (after basic deduction) attracts gift tax at 10%–55% |
| Inheritance | Crypto included in estate at FMV; inheritance tax applies |

### 9.3 NTA Enforcement

- Japanese exchanges report all user transaction data to the NTA
- The NTA has a dedicated crypto audit team
- Non-filing or underreporting of crypto income carries penalties: 15%–20% additional tax (過少申告加算税) plus interest (延滞税)

---

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — BTC Trading, Total Average Method

**Input:** Japanese tax resident, salary earner (salary ¥6,000,000). CY 2025 crypto activity:
- 1 January: Holds 0.5 BTC (opening balance), cost ¥2,000,000
- 15 March: Buys 1 BTC at ¥8,000,000
- 20 June: Buys 0.5 BTC at ¥9,000,000
- 10 October: Sells 1 BTC at ¥12,000,000
- Exchange fees: ¥30,000 (on sales)

**Computation (Total Average Method / 総平均法):**
```
Opening: 0.5 BTC, value ¥2,000,000
Acquired in year: 1.5 BTC, value ¥17,000,000 (¥8,000,000 + ¥9,000,000)

Total: 2 BTC, total cost ¥19,000,000
Year-end unit cost = ¥19,000,000 ÷ 2 = ¥9,500,000 per BTC

Transfer cost for 1 BTC sold = 1 × ¥9,500,000 = ¥9,500,000

Income calculation:
  Proceeds:         ¥12,000,000
  Transfer cost:    ¥9,500,000
  Exchange fees:    ¥30,000
  Net income:       ¥2,470,000

Remaining: 1 BTC, value ¥9,500,000 (carries to next year)

Tax:
  Salary: ¥6,000,000
  Crypto misc. income: ¥2,470,000
  Total income: ¥8,470,000
  (deductions applied, then progressive rates)
  Crypto pushes income into higher bracket.
  Exceeds ¥200,000 threshold → must file Kakutei Shinkoku.
```

### Example 2 — Crypto-to-Crypto Swap

**Input:** Japanese tax resident. Swaps 2 ETH (cost basis ¥600,000 total via total average) for 0.1 BTC when:
- FMV of 0.1 BTC = ¥1,000,000
- FMV of 2 ETH = ¥1,000,000

**Computation:**
```
Disposal of 2 ETH:
  Proceeds (FMV of BTC received):  ¥1,000,000
  Cost basis of 2 ETH:             ¥600,000
  Gain:                             ¥400,000

  This ¥400,000 is miscellaneous income.

Acquisition of 0.1 BTC:
  Cost basis = ¥1,000,000 (FMV at time of swap)
  Added to BTC total average pool.
```

### Example 3 — Mining Income with Expenses

**Input:** Japanese tax resident. Mined 0.05 BTC over CY 2025. FMV at various receipt dates totals ¥500,000. Electricity costs attributable to mining: ¥80,000. Hardware (¥300,000 PC, 30% crypto use, 4-year depreciation).

**Computation:**
```
Mining income (miscellaneous): ¥500,000

Deductible expenses:
  Electricity:                      ¥80,000
  Depreciation: ¥300,000 ÷ 4 × 30% = ¥22,500
  Total expenses:                   ¥102,500

Net mining miscellaneous income:    ¥397,500

Cost basis of mined BTC: ¥500,000 (FMV at receipt)
  For future disposal calculations.
```

- NEVER ignore crypto-to-crypto swaps — EVERY swap is a taxable event in Japan
- NEVER carry forward miscellaneous income losses to future years
- NEVER offset miscellaneous income losses against salary or other income categories
- NEVER assume the ¥200,000 threshold exempts from local inhabitant tax filing
- NEVER ignore the NTA notification requirement for moving average method election
- NEVER treat transfers between own wallets as disposals
- NEVER present crypto tax positions as definitive — always label as estimated and flag for professional review
