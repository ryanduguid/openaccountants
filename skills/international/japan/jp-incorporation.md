## Section 3 -- Breakeven Simulations

### Assumptions

- Sole proprietor: blue return (JPY 650,000 deduction), single, no dependents
- Corporation: capital JPY 1,000,000, single-person company, one officer
- Social insurance: Kyokai Kenpo (Tokyo), under 40 (no nursing care insurance)
- Officer compensation optimized to keep corporate profit under JPY 8,000,000
- Consumption tax excluded (same for both)

### 3.1 Business Income JPY 5,000,000 -- Sole Proprietor Wins

### 3.3 Business Income JPY 10,000,000 -- Corporation Wins

| | Sole Proprietor | Corporation (officer comp. JPY 7M) |
|---|---|---|
| Income/corporate tax + surtaxes | ~JPY 2,188,000 | ~JPY 1,240,000 |

| **Total burden** | **~JPY 3,298,000** | **~JPY 2,940,000** |

**Verdict:** Corporation saves ~JPY 360,000.

### 3.4 Business Income JPY 15,000,000 -- Corporation Clearly Wins

|---|---|---|
| Income/corporate tax + surtaxes | ~JPY 5,518,000 | ~JPY 3,620,000 |
| Social insurance | ~JPY 1,270,000 | ~JPY 2,400,000 |

| Establishment cost (electronic articles) | ~JPY 200,000 | ~JPY 60,000 |
| Establishment cost (paper articles) | ~JPY 240,000 | ~JPY 100,000 |

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Notarization fee | Not required |
| Registration tax | JPY 60,000 (or capital × 0.7%, whichever is higher) |

## Section 5 -- Officer Compensation Strategy (役員報酬)

### 5.1 Fixed Monthly Compensation Rule (定期同額給与)

To deduct officer compensation as a corporate expense, it must be paid monthly in equal amounts (Corporate Tax Act Art. 34, para. 1, item 1).

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Amount must be equal each month | Set once at the start of the fiscal year |
| Change window | Within 3 months of fiscal year start (at shareholders' meeting) |
| Mid-year changes | Prohibited except for extraordinary reasons |
| Bonuses to officers | Not deductible unless pre-registered (事前確定届出給与) |

### 5.2 Employment Income Deduction Advantage (給与所得控除)

This is the key advantage of incorporation. Sole proprietors only get the blue return deduction (max JPY 650,000), but officers get the employment income deduction:

| Annual Compensation | Employment Income Deduction (2025) |
|---|---|
| Up to JPY 1,625,000 | JPY 650,000 (minimum) |
| JPY 1,625,001 -- 1,800,000 | Compensation × 40% − JPY 100,000 |
| JPY 1,800,001 -- 3,600,000 | Compensation × 30% + JPY 80,000 |
| JPY 3,600,001 -- 6,600,000 | Compensation × 20% + JPY 440,000 |
| JPY 6,600,001 -- 8,500,000 | Compensation × 10% + JPY 1,100,000 |
| Over JPY 8,500,000 | JPY 1,950,000 (cap) |

### 5.3 Optimal Compensation Targets

| Business Profit | Officer Compensation Target | Corporate Profit Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| JPY 8,000,000 | JPY 6,000,000 | JPY 2,000,000 | Keep personal tax at 20% bracket |
| JPY 10,000,000 | JPY 7,000,000 | JPY 3,000,000 | Good balance of deduction and rate |
| JPY 12,000,000 | JPY 8,000,000 | JPY 4,000,000 | Maximize deduction; corporate profit at 15% rate |
| JPY 15,000,000 | JPY 9,000,000 | JPY 6,000,000 | Watch social insurance upper bounds |
| JPY 20,000,000 | JPY 10,000,000 | JPY 10,000,000 | Retain profits in corporation |
| JPY 30,000,000 | JPY 12,000,000 | JPY 18,000,000 | Significant corporate retention |

**Optimization principles:**
1. Keep corporate profit ≤ JPY 8,000,000 for the 15% reduced rate
2. Maximize employment income deduction (peaks at JPY 1,950,000 for comp. over JPY 8,500,000)
3. Consider social insurance cap: pension tops out at standard monthly compensation JPY 650,000 (~JPY 7,800,000 annual)
4. Balance personal progressive tax rates against flat corporate rate

### 5.4 Family Income Splitting

A corporation can pay salaries to family members as employees or directors, achieving income splitting:

| Scenario | Effect |
|---|---|
| Sole proprietor: all JPY 12M to owner | Owner at ~23% marginal rate |
| Corporation: JPY 9M to owner + JPY 3M to spouse | Owner at ~20%, spouse at ~5% |
| **Tax savings** | **~JPY 570,000/year** |

**Requirements:** Family employees must have genuine work duties. Compensation must be reasonable for the role. No-work salary payments will be denied as a deductible expense.

## Section 6 -- Social Insurance Comparison

### 6.1 Sole Proprietor vs Corporation

| Feature | Sole Proprietor (NHI + National Pension) | Corporation (Kyokai Kenpo + Employees' Pension) |
|---|---|---|
| Basis | Prior year income | Standard monthly compensation |
| Dependent coverage | None (each family member pays) | Yes (dependents covered at no extra cost) |
| Sick pay (傷病手当金) | None | 2/3 of daily comp. for up to 18 months |
| Maternity pay (出産手当金) | None | 2/3 of daily comp. |
| Pension benefit | Basic pension only (~JPY 810,000/year at full) | Basic + employees' pension (income-proportional) |
| Premium cap | NHI: ~JPY 1,090,000; pension: flat | Standard compensation table cap |

### 6.2 Social Insurance Rates (2025)

| Insurance | Rate | Burden |
|---|---|---|
| Health insurance (Kyokai Kenpo, national avg.) | ~10.00% | Split 50/50 employer/employee |
| Nursing care (age 40--64) | 1.59% | Split 50/50 |
| Employees' pension (厚生年金) | 18.3% | Split 50/50 |
| Child-rearing contribution | 0.36% | 100% employer |
| **Total (under 40)** | **~28.66%** | **~14.33% each** |
| **Total (40 and over)** | **~30.25%** | **~15.125% each** |

### 6.3 Social Insurance Cap

| Insurance | Standard Monthly Comp. Cap | Annual Comp. Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| Health insurance | JPY 1,390,000 (Grade 50) | ~JPY 16,680,000 |
| Employees' pension | JPY 650,000 (Grade 32) | ~JPY 7,800,000 |

Above the pension cap (~JPY 7,800,000 annual compensation), pension premiums stop increasing. Health insurance premiums stop at ~JPY 16,680,000.

---

## Section 7 -- Consumption Tax Exemption Reset

### 7.1 The Two-Year Exemption

A newly established corporation with capital under JPY 10,000,000 is generally exempt from consumption tax for the first two fiscal years (Consumption Tax Act Art. 12-2).

**Conditions:**
1. Capital under JPY 10,000,000
2. First fiscal period: no base period exists → exempt
3. Second fiscal period: exempt IF specified-period taxable sales (or wages) ≤ JPY 10,000,000
4. Not a "specified newly established corporation" (特定新規設立法人)

### 7.2 Maximizing the Exemption Period

| Strategy | Effect |
|---|---|
| Set capital below JPY 10,000,000 (e.g., JPY 9,990,000) | Qualifies for exemption |
| Make first fiscal period ≤ 7 months | Eliminates specified-period test for 2nd year |
| Delay qualified invoice registration | Preserves exemption (but may lose clients who need invoices) |

**Example:** Establish on October 1 with March fiscal year-end → first period = 6 months → no specified period → second period also exempt → up to ~19 months exempt.

### 7.3 Invoice Registration Caution

If the sole proprietor was already a qualified invoice issuer:
- The corporation needs its own new invoice registration
- Registering makes the corporation taxable from the registration date, losing the exemption
- The individual's registration does NOT automatically cancel -- submit a cancellation notice (適格請求書発行事業者の登録の取消しを求める届出書)
- The 20% special measure (2割特例) may apply to the new corporation through periods ending September 2026

---

## Section 8 -- Establishment Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-establishment Decisions

| Decision | Considerations |
|---|---|
| Corporate form | KK vs GK (see Section 4) |
| Trade name (商号) | Check for conflicts at Legal Affairs Bureau |
| Business purpose | List broadly in articles (include future activities) |
| Registered office | Home address or office |
| Capital amount | Under JPY 10,000,000 for CT exemption |
| Fiscal year-end | Avoid March (tax adviser busy season); optimize for CT exemption |
| Incorporators | Confirm contributing members |
| Seals (印鑑) | Representative seal, bank seal, square seal |

### Step 2: Draft and Authenticate Articles of Incorporation

**KK:** Create articles → notarize at public notary office (公証役場)
**GK:** Create articles → no notarization required

### Step 3: Capital Contribution

1. Transfer capital to the incorporator's personal bank account
2. Prepare a copy of the bankbook page showing the transfer
3. Create a certificate of capital contribution (払込証明書)

### Step 4: Registration at Legal Affairs Bureau

Submit: registration application, articles, capital contribution proof, officer acceptance letters, seal registration form. Pay registration tax.

Processing time: typically 1--2 weeks. Obtain certificate of registered matters (登記事項証明書) and seal certificate (印鑑証明書) after completion.

### Step 5: Post-Establishment Filings

#### Tax Office (税務署)

| Filing | Deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Corporate establishment notice (法人設立届出書) | Within 2 months of establishment | Attach articles + registration certificate |
| Blue return approval application (青色申告の承認申請書) | Within 3 months of establishment OR fiscal year end (whichever is earlier) | **Highest priority -- missing this means white return** |
| Payroll office opening notice (給与支払事務所等の開設届出書) | Within 1 month | Required if paying officer compensation |
| Special withholding payment approval (源泉所得税の納期の特例) | As soon as possible | Allows semi-annual withholding deposits (≤10 employees) |
| CT taxable business election (消費税課税事業者選択届出書) | By end of fiscal year | If registering for invoices |
| Qualified invoice registration (適格請求書発行事業者の登録申請書) | Any time | If clients require invoices |

---

## Section 9 -- Closing the Sole Proprietorship

If not maintaining a dual structure, file these to close the sole proprietorship:

| Filing | Submit To | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Business opening/closing notice (開業・廃業等届出書) | Tax office | Within 1 month of closure |
| Blue return cessation (青色申告の取りやめ届出書) | Tax office | By March 15 of following year |
| Business cessation notice (CT) (事業廃止届出書) | Tax office | Promptly |
| Invoice registration cancellation (適格請求書発行事業者の登録取消届出書) | Tax office | 15 days before start of desired cancellation period |
| Payroll office closure (給与支払事務所等の廃止届出書) | Tax office | Within 1 month |
| Enterprise tax cessation (個人事業税の事業廃止届出書) | Prefectural tax office | Promptly |

**Important notes:**

- Transfer inventory to the corporation at fair market value
- Transfer fixed assets at book value or fair market value (beware of below-market transfers)
- Settle all receivables/payables between individual and corporation
- Consider filing for estimated tax reduction (予定納税の減額申請)

---

## Section 10 -- Micro Corporation + Sole Proprietorship ("Two-Sword" Strategy)

### Overview

Maintain the sole proprietorship while also establishing a micro corporation (マイクロ法人). The corporation pays minimal officer compensation to access corporate social insurance at the lowest tier.

### Structure

```
Micro Corporation:
  → Officer compensation: ~JPY 63,000/month (JPY 756,000/year)
  → Social insurance: enrolled at minimum tier
  → Annual social insurance (personal share): ~JPY 107,000

Sole Proprietorship (continued):
  → Business income filed via 確定申告
  → No NHI or national pension obligation (covered by corporate insurance)

Compared to sole proprietor only at JPY 10,000,000 income:
  NHI + national pension: ~JPY 1,100,000/year
  Micro corp social insurance (both shares): ~JPY 210,000/year
  Potential savings: ~JPY 890,000/year
```

### Risk Factors

| Risk | Description |
|---|---|
| Tax denial | If the corporation has no real business activity, it may be treated as a paper company |
| Same business split | Splitting the same client work between personal and corporate is high-risk for denial |
| Zero revenue corporation | A corporation existing solely for social insurance access may be challenged |
| Audit exposure | Cannot explain a reasonable business separation |

**Acceptable examples:** Personal = freelance engineering (main); Corporation = SaaS product development (separate business). **Unacceptable:** Both entities doing the same programming work for the same clients.

---

## Section 11 -- Optimal Timing

| Factor | Recommended Timing | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Income tax optimization | Mid-year | Split income between individual (first half) and corporation |
| Consumption tax reset | Before becoming a taxable business | Maximize exemption period |
| Accounting simplicity | January 1 | Clean separation of individual fiscal year and corporate fiscal year |
| Client relationships | Start of quarter | Smoother invoice/contract transition |
| Fiscal year-end choice | Avoid March | Tax advisers are busiest in March; consider September or December |

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER present incorporation as universally beneficial -- at lower income levels, sole proprietorship is cheaper
- NEVER recommend specific officer compensation amounts as definitive -- individual circumstances vary
- NEVER ignore social insurance costs in the comparison -- they are often the largest single factor
- NEVER assume consumption tax exemption applies if the corporation registers for qualified invoices
- NEVER recommend the "two-sword" strategy without prominently disclosing tax denial risks
- NEVER omit the annual JPY 70,000+ corporate inhabitant tax (均等割) from cost projections -- it applies even when the corporation has no profit
- NEVER forget to mention tax adviser fees (~JPY 300,000--500,000/year) as a fixed cost of incorporation
- NEVER present simulations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a 税理士 for confirmation
