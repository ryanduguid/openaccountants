# Pakistan Payroll & Salary Withholding — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Item | Who | Notes (verify current Finance Act) |
|---|---|---|
| Salary income tax | Employer withholds from employee | Salaried slabs, top 35%; first PKR 600,000 exempt |
| EOBI | Employer ~5% + employee ~1% of minimum wage | Where 5+ employees (some 1+) |
| Provincial social security (ESSI) | Employer | For secured (low-wage) employees; province-specific |
| Monthly withholding statement | Employer → FBR (IRIS) | Plus annual statement |
| Currency | — | PKR |
| Quality tier | — | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Pakistani practitioner |

## Section 2 — Mechanics (Tier 1)
- The employer computes each employee's annual tax under the **salaried slabs**, divides by 12, and **withholds monthly**, depositing to the FBR and filing the **monthly withholding statement** via IRIS.
- **EOBI** (old-age pension) applies once the employer hits the employee threshold; **provincial ESSI** applies for secured employees. Both are employer-administered.
- A solo freelancer with **no employees** has no payroll obligations (see pk-social-contributions).

## Section 3 — Worked example
A small studio pays an employee PKR 1,200,000/year: compute tax on the salaried slabs (first 600k exempt; remainder at the applicable rate — verify), withhold ~1/12 monthly, deposit to FBR, file the monthly statement; register/contribute to EOBI if at the threshold.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER use non-salaried/business slabs for employees (use salaried slabs).
- NEVER skip the monthly withholding statement.
- NEVER state slab/EOBI figures without verifying the current Finance Act.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify withholding slabs and EOBI/ESSI rules with the FBR and the relevant authority. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
