# Pakistan IT & Freelance Export Tax — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Pakistan |
| Who this is for | Freelancers / firms exporting IT & IT-enabled services (software, design, BPO, remote work for foreign clients) |
| Concessional final tax — PSEB-registered exporter | ~0.25% of export proceeds (verify current Finance Act rate) |
| Concessional final tax — not PSEB-registered | ~1% of export proceeds (verify) |
| Condition | Proceeds **remitted through normal banking channels** into Pakistan (PRC / bank credit advice) |
| Currency | PKR |
| Tax year | 1 July – 30 June |
| Tax authority | Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) — IRIS portal (iris.fbr.gov.pk) |
| Registrations | NTN (FBR) + PSEB registration (pseb.org.pk) for the lower rate |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Pakistani tax practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults
| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| PSEB registration unknown | Assume NOT registered → higher (~1%) rate; recommend registering |
| Remittance channel unknown | Assume informal → concession may be LOST; require banking-channel proof |
| Whether income is "export of services" | Foreign client + service delivered from Pakistan + foreign-currency remittance = export |

## Section 2 — How it works (Tier 1)
- Income from **export of IT/ITeS** is taxed under a **concessional final-tax regime** instead of the normal progressive business slabs — provided proceeds are **brought into Pakistan through banking channels** in foreign currency.
- **PSEB registration** (Pakistan Software Export Board) secures the **lowest** rate (~0.25%). Without it, a higher rate (~1%) applies. Verify the exact rates in the current Finance Act — these have changed and may be a final tax or a reduced/minimum tax.
- Keep the **bank credit advice / PRC (Proceeds Realization Certificate)** for every receipt — it is the evidence the concession depends on.
- Domestic (Pakistan-client) income does **not** get the export concession — it falls under ordinary business income (see pk-income-tax).

## Section 3 — Worked Example
Freelancer earns USD 30,000 from foreign clients via Upwork, remitted through a Pakistani bank (≈ PKR 8,400,000):
- **PSEB-registered:** ~0.25% final tax ≈ **PKR 21,000**.
- **Not PSEB-registered:** ~1% ≈ **PKR 84,000**.
- Compare with ordinary business slabs (up to 45%) — the export concession is dramatically lower. Verify rates.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER apply the export concession to proceeds NOT remitted through banking channels.
- NEVER apply it to domestic-client income.
- NEVER state the rate as final without verifying the current Finance Act (rates change yearly).
- NEVER omit the PSEB-registration recommendation for the lower rate.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. The IT-export tax rate, its final-vs-minimum character, and PSEB rules change with each Finance Act — verify with the FBR and PSEB. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani tax practitioner before filing. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
