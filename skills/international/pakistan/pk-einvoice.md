# Pakistan E-Invoicing & Digital Compliance — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Pakistan |
| Federal e-invoicing | FBR electronic/digital invoicing for sales-tax-registered persons — integration with the FBR system (verify current SRO scope + dates) |
| Retail POS | Tier-1 retailers integrate POS for real-time sales reporting to the FBR |
| Provincial services | Provincial authorities (SRB/PRA/KPRA/BRA) have their own e-invoicing/return systems |
| Authority | Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) + provincial revenue authorities |
| Currency | PKR |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Pakistani practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

## Section 2 — Key points (Tier 1)
- The FBR has been **expanding mandatory electronic/digital invoicing** for sales-tax-registered businesses, requiring integration so invoices are reported to the FBR system in (near) real time. **Scope and start dates are set by SRO and rolling** — verify which categories are currently in scope.
- **Tier-1 retailers** must integrate **POS** with the FBR for real-time sales reporting (FBR POS invoice with verifiable QR).
- A **solo freelancer who is not sales-tax-registered** generally is **not** within the e-invoicing mandate — but must still issue proper invoices (with NTN) and, for exports, keep banking-channel proof (see pk-bookkeeping).
- **Provincial services** sales tax has separate e-filing/e-invoicing systems per province.

## Section 3 — Worked example
A sales-tax-registered IT services firm in Punjab: files services sales tax with the **PRA** and follows PRA e-invoicing/return rules; if also registered federally for goods, follows FBR digital-invoicing integration. A non-registered freelancer simply issues NTN invoices and keeps PRCs.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER tell a sales-tax-registered person in scope they can skip FBR digital-invoicing integration.
- NEVER assume a single national e-invoicing system — federal (goods) and provincial (services) differ.
- NEVER state SRO scope/dates without verifying the current FBR notifications.

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. FBR e-invoicing scope and dates change by SRO — verify with the FBR and the relevant provincial authority. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
