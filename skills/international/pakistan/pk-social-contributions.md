# Pakistan Social Security & Pension Contributions — Skill v1.0

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Scheme | Who | Contribution (verify current rates) |
|---|---|---|
| EOBI (Employees' Old-Age Benefits Institution) | Employers with 5+ employees (some 1+) | Employer ~5% + employee ~1% of minimum wage |
| Provincial social security (ESSI / PESSI / SESSI / KPESSI / BESSI) | Employers, for secured (low-wage) employees | Employer % of wages (province-specific) |
| Self-employed / freelancers | Generally OUTSIDE mandatory schemes | EOBI **voluntary** self-employment option may exist (verify) |

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Currency | PKR |
| Authorities | EOBI (federal); provincial ESSIs |
| Quality tier | Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Pakistani tax practitioner |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

## Section 2 — Key points (Tier 1)
- Pakistan's social-security system is largely **employer-employee** based (EOBI for pensions; provincial ESSIs for medical/contingency benefits for secured employees).
- A **self-employed freelancer with no employees generally has no mandatory social contribution** — this is unlike most other countries and is important to state clearly. Income tax (and, for exporters, the IT-export final tax) is the main obligation.
- If the freelancer **hires employees**, EOBI (5+ employees) and the relevant **provincial ESSI** registration/contributions can apply (see pk-payroll).
- A **voluntary** EOBI route for self-employed/voluntary insured persons may be available — verify current rules.

## Section 3 — Worked example
A solo freelancer with no staff: **no** EOBI/ESSI contribution due; obligations are income tax / IT-export final tax only. If they later hire 5 staff, EOBI registration and contributions begin.

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER tell a solo freelancer they owe mandatory EOBI/ESSI as a self-employed person (generally they do not) — but flag the voluntary option.
- NEVER omit EOBI/ESSI once the freelancer becomes an employer above the thresholds.
- NEVER state contribution rates without verifying current EOBI/provincial figures.

Informational only; not advice. Verify EOBI and provincial ESSI rules with the relevant authority. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani practitioner. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
