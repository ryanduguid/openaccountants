# Morocco — Auto-Entrepreneur Regime (Statut de l'Auto-Entrepreneur)

The **auto-entrepreneur** (AE) status is Morocco's flagship simplified regime for
freelancers, sole traders, and micro-businesses. It replaces ordinary income-tax
accounting with a single **impôt libératoire** computed as a flat percentage of
**turnover actually collected** (chiffre d'affaires encaissé), bundles a dedicated
social-cover scheme (**CNSS / AMO**), and is administered through the national
register **RNAE** (Registre National de l'Auto-Entrepreneur). It is governed by
**Loi n° 114-13** and Articles **42 bis, 42 ter, 43, 44-II and 73-III** of the
**Code Général des Impôts (CGI)**.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (auto-entrepreneur, IR, CNSS, AMO, DGI, RNAE) and
explain them in the user's chosen language.

### Conservative defaults

When data is missing or ambiguous, the agent applies the **conservative default**
and flags it for the reviewer:

- **Activity mix unknown** → treat the activity as **services (1%)**, the higher
  rate, until the user confirms it is commercial/industrial/artisanal (0.5%).
- **Turnover near a ceiling** → assume the ceiling is **breached** and warn about
  exit consequences rather than assume continued eligibility.
- **Single-client revenue near MAD 80,000** → assume the **30% withholding** on the
  excess applies, and tell the user to confirm with the paying client.
- **Eligibility uncertain (possible regulated profession)** → assume the activity
  is **excluded** and route to `ma-cpu` / `ma-income-tax` until confirmed.
- **2026 figures** → all rates and ceilings carry "verify current value"; check the
  **Loi de Finances 2026** and the DGI before finalising any number.

---

## 2. Eligibility & Excluded Activities

### Who can opt in

- Resident **physical persons** (individuals) carrying on an **industrial,
  commercial, artisanal, or service** activity on their own account.
- Annual turnover within the ceilings above.
- Registered in the **RNAE** and holding the AE card.

A person may combine activities (e.g. commerce + services) **provided each branch
stays under its own ceiling** and **neither branch exceeds its limit** — see §3 for
the combined-activity test.

### Excluded activities (professions réglementées and others)

The AE status is **not available** to **regulated/liberal professions** and a list
of other activities, including (non-exhaustive — confirm against the regulatory
list):

- **Liberal professions:** lawyers (avocats), notaries (notaires), doctors and
  health professionals (médecins, dentistes, pharmaciens), chartered accountants
  / experts-comptables, architects, engineers in regulated practice, court
  officers (huissiers, adouls), etc.
- **Financial / insurance** intermediation.
- **Real-estate development** (promotion immobilière).
- **Regulated transport** operators.
- Activities subject to **special licensing or excise** (e.g. tobacco, alcohol).

> **Default rule:** if there is *any* doubt that the activity is a regulated
> profession, treat it as **excluded** and route the user to `ma-cpu`
> (Contribution Professionnelle Unique) or `ma-income-tax` (régime du résultat net
> simplifié / réel). Do **not** assert eligibility for a borderline profession.

---

## 3. Rates & Computation

### Turnover bands and liberatory IR

Tax is a flat percentage of **turnover actually collected** during the period —
**no expense deduction**. The tax is **libératoire**: it discharges the AE's income
tax on that activity, so AE turnover is **not** re-entered on the progressive IR
scale and **no annual global IR return** is filed for the AE activity.

| Activity | Annual ceiling | IR rate on collected turnover |
|---|---|---|
| Commercial / industrial / artisanal | MAD 500,000 *(verify)* | **0.5%** *(verify)* |
| Services (prestations de services) | MAD 200,000 *(verify)* | **1%** *(verify)* |

**Formula:**

```
IR libératoire = turnover collected in the quarter × rate (0.5% or 1%)
```

> Some sources reference a small **supplementary/professional duty** layered on
> top of the base rate in certain brackets. Treat any add-on as **"verify current
> value against the DGI auto-entrepreneur guide / Loi de Finances 2026"** before
> using it in a computation.

### Combined activities

If a user runs both a commercial and a service branch, apply **each rate to its own
turnover** and check **each branch against its own ceiling**. Breaching **either**
ceiling triggers the exit rule in §5.

### The single-client > MAD 80,000 rule (anti-salary-disguise)

To stop employers re-labelling employees as auto-entrepreneurs, the law caps how
much an AE may bill **one single client**:

- For **services**, when annual revenue from **one client** exceeds **MAD 80,000**,
  the **excess above 80,000** is **not** taxed at the 1% liberatory rate.
- Instead the **paying client withholds tax at source at 30%** *(verify rate —
  historically 30%, per CGI Art. 73)* on the excess, and this withholding is
  **liberatory** for that excess.

**Formula (per client, per year):**

```
Taxed at 1% liberatory   = min(client revenue, 80,000)
Subject to 30% withholding = max(client revenue − 80,000, 0)
30% withholding (by client) = max(client revenue − 80,000, 0) × 30%   (verify rate)
```

> Practical effect: an AE doing essentially full-time work for **one** company gets
> pushed toward an employee-like 30% rate on the excess. If a user's revenue is
> concentrated in one client, flag both the **tax** consequence and the **labour-law
> risk** of disguised employment (requalification en contrat de travail).

## 4. Social Cover (CNSS / AMO for Auto-Entrepreneurs)

Since **décret n° 2.21.477 (2021)** and the généralisation of **AMO** (Assurance
Maladie Obligatoire) to non-salaried workers (**TNS**), CNSS affiliation is
**mandatory** for every auto-entrepreneur.

### What it covers

- **AMO** — mandatory health insurance: medical costs, hospitalisation, medicines,
  for the AE, spouse, and children.
- **Basic retirement** (retraite de base).
- **Daily allowances** for maternity / temporary incapacity, subject to
  contribution conditions.

### How contributions are computed

Contributions are **forfaitaires** (flat-rate by bracket), **based on declared
turnover**, and **collected quarterly alongside the tax** through the AE portal.

- The CNSS scheme uses **fixed brackets T1 to T8**; declared (annualised) turnover
  places the AE in a bracket, each with a **set contribution amount** *(verify the
  current T1–T8 amounts on cnss.ma / ae.gov.ma — not consistently published)*.
- A **minimum** contribution applies even with **zero turnover** — historically
  **~MAD 300 / quarter (≈ MAD 1,200 / year)** *(verify current value)*.
- Commonly cited bases: services ≈ **50% of turnover**, commercial ≈ **20% of
  turnover** used to set the bracket *(verify — methodology varies by source)*.

> **Default:** when the exact bracket amount is unknown, quote the **minimum
> ~MAD 300/quarter** floor and tell the user the precise figure must be read off the
> **CNSS / ae.gov.ma** bracket table for their declared turnover. Do **not** invent a
> T1–T8 amount.

---

## 5. Registration & Filing / Payment Calendar

### Registration (RNAE)

1. Apply on **`rn.ae.gov.ma`** (the RNAE portal, run by **Poste Maroc / Al Barid
   Bank**) or at a **Barid Bank** branch.
2. Provide CIN (national ID), activity, and address; registration is **free**.
3. Processing typically **7–15 days**; you receive the **auto-entrepreneur card**
   and a tax identifier.
4. CNSS affiliation is created alongside registration.

### Filing & payment (quarterly)

Declaration and payment are **quarterly**, **online**, and **nil declarations
(déclaration néant) are still required** when there is no turnover.

| Quarter | Period | Declare & pay by *(verify exact dates each year)* |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Jan–Mar | end of **April** |
| Q2 | Apr–Jun | end of **July** |
| Q3 | Jul–Sep | end of **October** |
| Q4 | Oct–Dec | end of **January** (following year) |

Payment is online (carte bancaire, virement, réseaux agréés). The **CNSS
contribution is collected at the same time** as the tax.

> Missing a declaration (including a nil one) or a payment risks penalties and,
> ultimately, **radiation** from the RNAE. Confirm exact deadlines for 2026 on
> ae.gov.ma.

## 6. Worked Examples

> All figures use the 2026 rates/ceilings flagged "verify". Recompute with confirmed
> values before relying on them.

### Example 1 — Service freelancer, multiple clients

Sara is a freelance web developer (services). 2026 collected turnover **MAD
150,000**, spread across 5 clients (largest single client MAD 45,000).

- Within the services ceiling (200,000). Eligible.
- No client exceeds 80,000 → no 30% withholding.
- **IR = 150,000 × 1% = MAD 1,500** for the year.
- Plus CNSS quarterly contributions per her turnover bracket *(verify amount)*.

### Example 2 — Services with one dominant client (>80k rule)

Youssef does design work; 2026 turnover **MAD 120,000**, of which **MAD 100,000
from a single agency** and MAD 20,000 from others.

- Within ceiling (200,000). Eligible.
- Single client = 100,000 > 80,000 → excess = **20,000**.
  - First 80,000 from that client + the 20,000 from other clients = **100,000 at
    1%** → **MAD 1,000**.
  - Excess **20,000 × 30% = MAD 6,000** withheld at source by the agency *(verify
    rate)*, liberatory on that slice.
- **Total tax ≈ MAD 7,000.** Flag the disguised-employment risk given the
  concentration.

### Example 3 — Commercial activity at the lower rate

Khadija resells handmade goods (commercial/artisanal). 2026 collected turnover
**MAD 400,000**.

- Within commercial ceiling (500,000). Eligible.
- **IR = 400,000 × 0.5% = MAD 2,000** for the year.
- Plus CNSS quarterly contributions per bracket *(verify)*.

### Example 4 — Ceiling breach → exit

Omar (services) collects **MAD 230,000** in 2026, exceeding the 200,000 services
ceiling.

- One year over is **tolerated**; the AE is generally **radiated only if the
  ceiling is exceeded two consecutive years** *(verify the current grace rule)*.
- On exit, Omar moves to **`ma-cpu` (CPU)** or the **`ma-income-tax`** régimes
  (résultat net simplifié / réel) and ordinary IR/TVA obligations may begin.
- Action: model the post-exit position with `ma-cpu` and `ma-income-tax` and advise
  on TVA registration thresholds.

---

## 7. Tier 2 — Reviewer Judgement Required

Escalate to the **Moroccan expert-comptable** reviewer when:

- **Single-client concentration** suggests **disguised employment** (labour-law
  requalification risk beyond the 30% tax point).
- **Ceiling breach** in the current or prior year — exit mechanics, CPU vs net-income
  routing, and TVA registration.
- **Borderline excluded activity** (possible regulated profession) — eligibility call.
- **Combined activities** straddling both ceilings.
- **CNSS bracket / AMO** entitlement disputes or arrears.
- **VAT (TVA)** interaction — AE turnover is generally outside ordinary TVA, but
  confirm against the TVA thresholds (see `morocco-vat`) if activity is borderline.
- Any client-specific number where the agent had to fall back to a "verify" value.

The agent must **never** present these as settled; it presents the computation, the
assumptions, and the open items for the reviewer to sign off.

## 8. Reference

### Legal references

- **Loi n° 114-13** relative au statut de l'auto-entrepreneur (19 February 2015).
- **Code Général des Impôts (CGI)** — Art. **42 bis, 42 ter** (regime &
  conditions), **43, 44-II** (turnover ceilings / base), **73-III** (rates,
  including the single-client withholding).
- **Décret n° 2.21.477 (2021)** — mandatory CNSS / AMO affiliation for
  auto-entrepreneurs (généralisation AMO to TNS).
- **Loi de Finances 2026** — confirm current rates, ceilings, and any add-on
  duty; **2025 IR reform context:** the ordinary IR scale was reformed (exempt
  band raised to **MAD 40,000**, top rate reduced to **37%**), which is the
  fallback regime if an AE exits.
- Authority: **Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI)** — tax.gov.ma. Register:
  **RNAE** — rn.ae.gov.ma (Poste Maroc / Al Barid Bank). Social: **CNSS** —
  cnss.ma.

### Short test suite

1. **Q:** Service freelancer, MAD 90,000 turnover, no client over 80k. **A:** IR =
   90,000 × 1% = **MAD 900**; within ceiling; CNSS per bracket.
2. **Q:** Commercial AE, MAD 600,000 turnover. **A:** **Ceiling breached**
   (>500,000) — flag exit, route to `ma-cpu` / `ma-income-tax`.
3. **Q:** Services AE, single client pays MAD 130,000. **A:** 80,000 at 1% (MAD
   800); **50,000 × 30% = MAD 15,000** withheld by client *(verify rate)*; flag
   disguised-employment risk.
4. **Q:** Doctor wants AE status. **A:** **Excluded** (regulated profession) —
   route to `ma-income-tax`.
5. **Q:** Zero turnover this quarter. **A:** Still file a **déclaration néant**;
   **minimum CNSS** (~MAD 300/quarter, verify) still due.
6. **Q:** Activity mix not stated. **A:** Default to **services / 1%** and the
   200,000 ceiling until confirmed.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** confirm eligibility for any **regulated/liberal profession** (lawyer,
  doctor, notary, expert-comptable, architect, etc.) — default to **excluded**.
- **Do NOT** apply the AE liberatory rates to turnover **above a ceiling** — once
  breached, the regime no longer applies; route to `ma-cpu` / `ma-income-tax`.
- **Do NOT** ignore the **single-client > MAD 80,000** rule for services — apply the
  30% withholding on the excess *(verify rate)* and flag disguised-employment risk.
- **Do NOT** deduct business expenses — the base is **turnover collected**, gross.
- **Do NOT** invent CNSS **T1–T8** bracket amounts — quote the minimum floor and
  send the user to cnss.ma / ae.gov.ma for the exact figure.
- **Do NOT** state any rate, ceiling, or deadline as final without the **"verify
  current value"** caveat against the **Loi de Finances 2026** and the DGI.
- **Do NOT** advise on **TVA**, employees/payroll, multi-state, or company forms
  (SARL/SA) under this skill — route to the relevant skill.
- **Do NOT** issue a return as filed without **expert-comptable** sign-off.
