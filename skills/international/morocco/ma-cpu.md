# Morocco — Contribution Professionnelle Unique (CPU)

The **Contribution Professionnelle Unique (CPU)** — *المساهمة المهنية الموحدة* —
is Morocco's single-tax regime for small individual taxpayers whose professional
income was historically determined under the **régime du bénéfice forfaitaire**
(the flat-rate profit regime). The forfaitaire regime was **abrogated from 1
January 2021** and replaced by the CPU, instituted by **Article 6 of the Loi de
Finances n° 65.20** for budget year 2020.

The CPU bundles, into a **single payment**, the taxes that a small professional
used to pay separately:

- the **impôt sur le revenu (IR)** on professional income, plus
- the **taxe professionnelle (TP)** and **taxe de services communaux (TSC)** —
  both now **permanently exonerated** for CPU taxpayers (Loi 07-20 amending Loi
  47-06 on local taxation), plus
- a **droit complémentaire** (complementary duty) that funds social protection,
  in the first instance **mandatory basic health insurance (AMO)**.

CPU sits **between** the two other self-employed routes:

- **`ma-auto-entrepreneur`** — simpler, lower ceilings, a flat 0.5%/1% liberatory
  IR on collected turnover. Use when the taxpayer qualifies and is below the AE
  ceilings.
- **`ma-income-tax`** (RNR — *résultat net réel* / RNS — *résultat net
  simplifié*) — real-accounting regimes, mandatory above the CPU ceilings or by
  option. Use when the CPU ceilings are breached or real-expense deduction is
  beneficial.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French,
and Darija — keep the native terms (CPU, IR, DGI, AMO, CNSS, droit
complémentaire) and explain them in the user's chosen language.

## 1. Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Morocco (MA) |
| Regime | Contribution Professionnelle Unique (CPU) — replaced the régime forfaitaire from 2021 |
| Currency | MAD (dirham marocain, DH) |
| Turnover ceiling — commercial / industrial / artisanal | **MAD 2,000,000 / year (VAT included)** *(verify current value)* |
| Turnover ceiling — services / liberal professions | **MAD 500,000 / year (VAT included)** *(verify current value)* |
| Tax base | **Turnover × profession coefficient** (coefficient per the table annexed to **Art. 40-I CGI**) |
| Liberatory IR rate (1st component) | **10%** of the base → CPU IR = turnover × coefficient × 10% *(verify current value)* |
| 2nd component | **Droit complémentaire** (AMO health cover), banded by the annual CPU IR amount — **MAD 1,200 → 14,400 / year** (8 bands) *(verify table)* |
| Effective minimum | No Art. 144 cotisation minimale applies to CPU; the practical floor is the **lowest droit complémentaire band = MAD 1,200 / year** *(verify)* |
| Plus-values / indemnités (cession / cessation) | **20% liberatory IR** on the net gain *(verify rate)* |
| Annual CA declaration & payment | **Before 1 April** of the year following the year the turnover was earned |
| Payment options | **Annual** (before 1 April) **or quarterly** (4 acomptes of 25%, before end of months 3, 6, 9, 12 of the following year) |
| Existence declaration (new taxpayer) | Within **30 days** of starting activity |
| Authority | **Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI)** — tax.gov.ma |

| Version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults

- **Activity not stated** → default to the **services / liberal** branch and the
  **MAD 500,000** ceiling (the lower, stricter limit), and flag for confirmation.
- **Coefficient not known with certainty** → do **not** guess; state the
  computation as `turnover × coefficient × 10%`, leave the coefficient as a
  *verify-from-the-Art. 40-I CGI annex* placeholder, and escalate to Tier 2.
- **Multiple activities** → compute **each** activity separately with its own
  coefficient, then sum (CGI Art. 40 — `D = Σ (CAᵢ × coefficientᵢ)`).
- **Any rate / ceiling / band** → present with the **"verify against Loi de
  Finances 2026 and the DGI"** caveat; never as final.
- **AMO adhesion** → the droit complémentaire is **due once the taxpayer is
  affiliated** to basic AMO; treat affiliation as mandatory under the regime.

---

## 2. Eligibility & Ceilings

### Who is in scope

CPU applies to **individuals (personnes physiques)** with professional income who
fall into one of these groups (CGI Art. 41; LF 65.20):

- taxpayers whose professional income **was determined under the old régime du
  bénéfice forfaitaire** before the 2021 reform (they roll into CPU automatically
  — **no formality required**, the prior forfaitaire declaration stands);
- taxpayers **starting** a professional activity who opt for CPU;
- taxpayers previously on **RNR / RNS** whose turnover has fallen **below the CPU
  ceiling** and who opt back into CPU.

### Turnover ceilings (VAT included)

The annual turnover must **not exceed**:

| Activity branch | Annual ceiling (TTC) |
|---|---|
| Commercial, industrial, artisanal | **MAD 2,000,000** *(verify)* |
| Services (prestations de services) and non-excluded liberal professions | **MAD 500,000** *(verify)* |

**Breach rule:** if a ceiling is exceeded for **two consecutive years**, the
**RNR (résultat net réel)** regime applies from **1 January of the year following
those two years**. A single year over the limit does **not** by itself force the
exit — but flag it and watch the second year.

### Exclusions

Professions, activities, and services listed in **décret n° 2-08-124 (28 May
2009)** are **excluded from CPU regardless of turnover**. These are broadly the
regulated/liberal professions (the same families typically excluded from the
auto-entrepreneur regime). If the activity is one of these, route to
**`ma-income-tax`**. When unsure whether an activity is excluded, **default to
excluded** and escalate.

### Option mechanics & deadlines

- **New taxpayers** opting for CPU: send a registered request (or hand-deliver
  against receipt) to the inspecteur des impôts —
  - **option at start of activity**: before **1 April** of the year following the
    start year;
  - **option in the course of activity** (e.g. coming from RNR/RNS): within the
    deadline for filing the prior year's global income declaration, i.e. before
    **1 May** of the current year; the option takes effect **the following year**.
- The option stays valid **as long as** turnover has not exceeded the ceiling for
  two consecutive years.

---

## 3. Computation

The CPU has **two components**: the **IR component** (1ère composante) and the
**droit complémentaire** (2ème composante — AMO health cover).

```
CPU = IR component + Droit complémentaire
    = (Turnover × profession coefficient × 10%) + droit complémentaire (from table)
```

### 3.1 IR component (1ère composante)

```
Taxable base   = Turnover (CA) × profession coefficient   ← coefficient per Art. 40-I CGI annex
IR component   = Taxable base × 10%   (taux libératoire — flat liberatory rate)
               = CA × coefficient × 10%
```

Important points:

- The **10% liberatory rate** is applied **directly** to the coefficient-adjusted
  base. The ordinary progressive **IR scale is NOT applied** to CPU income — the
  CPU's 10% replaces it. *(The progressive scale below is given only for context
  and for routing comparisons against `ma-income-tax`.)*
- **Mobile-payment turnover** (paiement mobile) for years **2020–2024** is
  **excluded** from the base (CGI Art. 247 ter incentive). Confirm whether any
  equivalent incentive continues for 2026.
- **Multiple activities** with different coefficients → compute each separately
  and sum.

**Profession coefficients (Art. 40-I CGI annex) — verify each value.** The annex
lists a coefficient for every activity/profession; coefficients have been grouped
and revised in consultation with professional associations to reflect net
margins. The DGI's own worked examples confirm these two values:

| Activity | Coefficient | Source confidence |
|---|---|---|
| Alimentation générale (general food retail) | **8%** | **Confirmed** (DGI CPU guide example) |
| Coiffeur (men's hairdresser) | **40%** | **Confirmed** (DGI CPU guide example) |
| Other commerce / services / artisanat / liberal | **per the Art. 40-I CGI annex** | *Must be read from the annex — do not guess* |

Do **not** invent coefficients for any other activity. Read the exact value from
the **annex to the CGI (Art. 40-I)** or the DGI's coefficient table.

### Context only — ordinary IR progressive scale (2026)

This scale governs **RNR/RNS** taxpayers, **not** CPU. Use it only to compare
routes or to model what happens if the taxpayer exits CPU.

| Annual taxable income (MAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 40,000 | **0% (exempt)** |
| 40,001 – 60,000 | 10% |
| 60,001 – 80,000 | 20% |
| 80,001 – 100,000 | 30% |
| 100,001 – 180,000 | 34% |
| Over 180,000 | **37%** |

*(2025 IR reform: exempt band raised to MAD 40,000, top rate cut to 37% — verify
against Loi de Finances 2026.)*

### 3.2 Minimum

There is **no Article 144 cotisation minimale** for CPU taxpayers — the 0.25%
(or 0.15%) minimum-contribution floor, raised to **MAD 3,000** for 2026, applies
to **RNR/RNS and corporate (IS)** taxpayers, **not** to CPU. Under CPU the
**effective floor** is the **lowest droit complémentaire band, MAD 1,200 / year**,
which is payable once the taxpayer is affiliated to AMO even when the IR component
is tiny. Do not apply the MAD 3,000 CM to a CPU return.

### 3.3 Droit complémentaire (2ème composante — AMO health cover)

The **annual IR component** (1ère composante) determines, by band, the **droit
complémentaire** payable for **AMO** (basic mandatory health insurance). It is due
once the taxpayer adheres to the AMO scheme.

| Annual IR component band (MAD) | Quarterly droit (MAD) | **Annual droit (MAD)** |
|---|---|---|
| Less than 500 | 300 | **1,200** |
| 500 – 1,000 | 390 | **1,560** |
| 1,001 – 2,500 | 570 | **2,280** |
| 2,501 – 5,000 | 720 | **2,880** |
| 5,001 – 10,000 | 1,050 | **4,200** |
| 10,001 – 25,000 | 1,500 | **6,000** |
| 25,001 – 50,000 | 2,250 | **9,000** |
| Over 50,000 | 3,600 | **14,400** |

*(Source: DGI CPU practical guide table. Verify the bands and amounts against the
current Loi de Finances / DGI publication.)*

The droit complémentaire is **pro-rated** when the period is shorter than a full
year (e.g. on a mid-year cessation — see Example 3): annualize the IR component to
find the band, then apply the months/12 fraction to the annual droit.

## 4. Filing & Payment Calendar

| Obligation | Deadline | Form / channel |
|---|---|---|
| **Existence declaration** (new taxpayer) | Within **30 days** of starting activity | Imprimé-modèle DGI; registered letter or against receipt |
| **Annual turnover (CA) declaration** | **Before 1 April** of the year following the year the turnover was earned | **SIMPL-CPU** on tax.gov.ma (pre-filled) — model **ADP150B**; paper accepted |
| **Annual payment** option | Spontaneous payment **before 1 April** (with the declaration) | Bordereau-avis **RSP150B**; télépaiement via SIMPL |
| **Quarterly payment** option | **4 acomptes of 25%** of the CPU due, before the end of **months 3, 6, 9 and 12** of the following year | Bordereau-avis **RSP150B** per quarter |
| **Plus-values / indemnités** declaration (cession / cessation) | Within **45 days** of the cession / cessation | Model **ADP160B**, bordereau **RSP160B** (CGI Art. 82 quater-II) |
| Transfer of fiscal domicile | Within **30 days** of the change | Imprimé-modèle DGI |
| Departure from Morocco | At least **30 days before** departure | — |
| Death | Within **3 months** of death | Heirs file |

Notes:

- **All** CPU taxpayers must file the CA declaration, **including** those whose IR
  in principal is **below MAD 5,000** — the old exemption from filing (former Art.
  86-4°) was abrogated by LF 2021.
- The declaration is **pre-filled** by the DGI in SIMPL-CPU based on the regime's
  computation rules; the taxpayer chooses the annual or quarterly payment option
  and (where applicable) supplies the AMO affiliation number and date.
- **Late filing / late payment** (CGI Art. 184 / 208): typically a **penalty of
  10%** (reduced to 5% if the delay ≤ 30 days), plus a **5%** surcharge for the
  first month of late payment and **0.5%** per additional month or fraction.
  *(Verify current rates.)*

## 5. Worked Examples

> All figures illustrative; coefficients and bands must be verified against the
> Art. 40-I CGI annex and the current DGI droit-complémentaire table.

### Example 1 — General food shop (alimentation générale)

- Turnover (CA): **MAD 375,000**; coefficient (alimentation générale): **8%**.
- IR component = `375,000 × 8% × 10%` = **MAD 3,000**.
- The MAD 3,000 IR falls in the **2,501–5,000** band → droit complémentaire =
  **MAD 2,880 / year**.
- **Total CPU = 3,000 + 2,880 = MAD 5,880 / year** (payable once AMO-affiliated).
- This mirrors the DGI's transitional example, where the same MAD 3,000 equalled
  the old IR + TP combined.

### Example 2 — New men's hairdresser (coiffeur), first year

- Turnover (CA): **MAD 60,000**; coefficient (coiffeur): **40%**.
- IR component = `60,000 × 40% × 10%` = **MAD 2,400**.
- The MAD 2,400 IR falls in the **1,001–2,500** band → droit complémentaire =
  **MAD 2,280 / year**.
- **Total CPU = 2,400 + 2,280 = MAD 4,680 / year**.

### Example 3 — Mid-year cessation with plus-value

- A carpenter (menuisier), AMO-affiliated, **ceases on 30 June** and **sells the
  business for MAD 180,000**, realizing a **net gain of MAD 100,000**. He earned
  **MAD 90,000** turnover in the first half; assume coefficient **12%** *(verify
  from the annex)*.
- **CPU on the half-year turnover:** `90,000 × 12% × 10%` = **MAD 1,080**.
- **Droit complémentaire (pro-rated):** annualize the IR — `1,080 × (12/6) = 2,160`
  → falls in the **1,001–2,500** band → annual droit **MAD 2,280**; pro-rate to 6
  months: `2,280 × 6/12 =` **MAD 1,140**.
- CPU to pay = `1,080 + 1,140 =` **MAD 2,220**.
- **Plus-value:** `100,000 × 20% =` **MAD 20,000** (separate 20% liberatory IR;
  declared on **ADP160B** within **45 days**).

### Example 4 — Ceiling breach (routing, not a CPU number)

- A trader's turnover is **MAD 2,300,000** (commercial) for a second consecutive
  year. The **MAD 2,000,000** ceiling is breached two years running → **RNR
  applies from 1 January** of the next year. Do **not** compute CPU; route to
  **`ma-income-tax`** and flag VAT (TVA) registration implications (see
  `morocco-vat`).

---

## 6. Tier 2 — Reviewer Judgement Required

Escalate to the **Moroccan expert-comptable** reviewer when:

- The **profession coefficient** is anything other than the confirmed values
  (alimentation 8%, coiffeur 40%) — the exact Art. 40-I annex value must be read
  and verified.
- **Borderline excluded activity** (possible décret 2-08-124 / regulated
  profession) — eligibility call; default to excluded.
- **Ceiling breach** in the current or prior year — exit timing (one vs two
  consecutive years), RNR/RNS routing, and **TVA** registration.
- **Multiple activities** straddling both ceilings or mixing coefficients.
- **Mobile-payment turnover** treatment (the 2020–2024 exclusion) and whether any
  equivalent incentive applies in 2026.
- **AMO affiliation** status / arrears — whether the droit complémentaire is yet
  payable, and the pro-rata on a part-year.
- **Plus-values / cessation** computations (depreciation recapture, indemnités).
- Any number where the agent had to fall back to a "verify" value.

The agent must **never** present these as settled; it presents the computation,
the assumptions, and the open items for the reviewer to sign off.

### Short test suite

1. **Q:** Alimentation générale, CA MAD 375,000, coefficient 8%. **A:** IR =
   375,000 × 8% × 10% = **MAD 3,000**; droit complémentaire band 2,501–5,000 =
   **MAD 2,880**; total **MAD 5,880**.
2. **Q:** Coiffeur, CA MAD 60,000, coefficient 40%. **A:** IR = 60,000 × 40% ×
   10% = **MAD 2,400**; droit band 1,001–2,500 = **MAD 2,280**; total **MAD
   4,680**.
3. **Q:** Services freelancer, CA MAD 700,000. **A:** **Ceiling breached**
   (>500,000 for services) — flag; if breached two years running route to
   **`ma-income-tax`** (RNR).
4. **Q:** Activity branch not stated. **A:** Default to **services / MAD 500,000
   ceiling**; do not assume a coefficient — escalate.
5. **Q:** Coefficient for "atelier de soudure" not known. **A:** Do **not** guess;

   Tier 2.
6. **Q:** Doctor / lawyer wants CPU. **A:** **Excluded** (décret 2-08-124 /
   regulated profession) — route to **`ma-income-tax`**.
7. **Q:** Does the MAD 3,000 cotisation minimale apply? **A:** **No** — Art. 144
   CM does not apply to CPU; the practical floor is the **MAD 1,200** droit
   complémentaire band.
8. **Q:** Sold the business, net gain MAD 100,000. **A:** **20% liberatory** =
   **MAD 20,000**; declare on **ADP160B** within **45 days**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** apply the **ordinary progressive IR scale** to CPU income — the CPU
  IR component is the **flat 10% liberatory** rate on the coefficient-adjusted
  base.
- **Do NOT** invent a **profession coefficient** — only `alimentation générale =
  8%` and `coiffeur = 40%` are confirmed here; every other value must be read from
  the **Art. 40-I CGI annex**.
- **Do NOT** apply the **Art. 144 cotisation minimale (MAD 3,000)** to a CPU
  taxpayer — it does not apply to CPU.
- **Do NOT** confirm eligibility for a **regulated / liberal profession** or any
  activity on **décret 2-08-124** — default to **excluded**, route to
  `ma-income-tax`.
- **Do NOT** keep computing CPU once a **ceiling** is breached for two consecutive
  years — route to **`ma-income-tax`** (RNR) and flag TVA.
- **Do NOT** omit the **droit complémentaire** — the CPU is IR component **plus**
  the AMO duty; remember to **pro-rate** it on a part-year.
- **Do NOT** deduct **business expenses** — the CPU base is **turnover × the
  profession coefficient**, not real net profit.
- **Do NOT** state any rate, ceiling, coefficient, or band as final without the
  **"verify against Loi de Finances 2026 and the DGI"** caveat.
- **Do NOT** advise on **TVA**, employees / payroll, or company forms (SARL/SA)
  under this skill — route to the relevant skill.
- **Do NOT** issue a return as filed without **expert-comptable** sign-off.
