# Morocco — Social Contributions for the Self-Employed (CNSS / AMO / Retraite TNS)

Morocco is in the middle of a multi-year **généralisation de la protection sociale**
(social-protection roll-out, Loi-cadre n° 09-21). The headline goal is to bring every
worker — salaried and **non-salaried (travailleurs non-salariés, TNS)** — into the
**Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale (CNSS)** for **mandatory health insurance
(Assurance Maladie Obligatoire, AMO)** and a **basic pension (retraite de base)**.

For the self-employed this happens **profession by profession**: each socioprofessional
category is brought in by its own **décret** that fixes a **forfaitaire (flat) income
base** for that category. Auto-entrepreneurs have a **dedicated, turnover-linked**
variant. Anyone who **hires staff** also has the ordinary **employer/employee CNSS**
obligations, which work very differently (percentages on real salary, with a ceiling).

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (CNSS, AMO, TNS, retraite, SMIG, DGI) and explain them
in the user's chosen language.

### Conservative defaults

When data is missing or ambiguous, the agent applies the **conservative default** and
flags it for the reviewer:

- **Profession not yet confirmed as "rolled out"** → assume affiliation **is now
  mandatory** (the roll-out is broad by 2026) and tell the user to confirm their
  category's **décret** and effective date on cnss.ma.
- **Category / forfaitaire base unknown** → do **not** guess the bracket; quote the
  rate formula and send the user to the **category décret** for the exact base.
- **Activity mix unknown (auto-entrepreneur)** → treat as **services (50% base)**, the
  higher base, until commercial (20%) is confirmed.
- **Zero / low turnover** → assume the **minimum contribution still applies** (no
  exoneration for "no income").
- **Has any staff** → assume **employer CNSS registration and monthly DAMANCOM** are
  due, separate from the owner's own TNS cover.
- **2026 figures** → every rate, base multiple, ceiling, and minimum carries "verify
  current value"; check the **Loi de Finances 2026**, the relevant **décret**, and
  **cnss.ma** before finalising any number.

## 2. Who Contributes

Three distinct populations, three different mechanics. Identify which one the user is in
**before** computing anything — they do not mix the same way.

### 2a. Travailleurs non-salariés (TNS) — by profession

The **TNS** regime covers self-employed people who are **not** auto-entrepreneurs and
**not** employees: independent professionals, regulated/liberal professions, and
own-account traders/artisans with accounts. They are brought in **category by
category**, each by a **décret** that fixes a **forfaitaire income** for that group.

Categories already brought in (illustrative, **non-exhaustive** — confirm each on
cnss.ma):

- **CPU** payers (Contribution Professionnelle Unique) — the largest cohort → see
  `ma-cpu`, which **bundles** its own AMO/social component.
- **Commerçants et artisans** keeping accounts (tenant une comptabilité).
- **Health professions:** médecins (doctors), pharmaciens, dentistes (chirurgiens-
  dentistes), sages-femmes, kinésithérapeutes, infirmiers, opticiens.
- **Legal / court professions:** notaires, adouls, avocats, huissiers, experts-
  comptables (each by its own décret / ordre).
- **Architects, engineers, and other ordres professionnels** as their décrets land.

> Each profession's **forfaitaire base** is set in **its own décret**. The agent must
> not transplant one category's base onto another.

### 2b. Auto-entrepreneurs — dedicated cover

Auto-entrepreneurs have a **dedicated, simplified** social cover: affiliation is
**automatic** on RNAE registration, and the contribution is **linked to declared
turnover** rather than a fixed category forfait (see §3 and `ma-auto-entrepreneur`).

### 2c. Employees and those who hire (ordinary CNSS)

If a self-employed person **hires staff**, they become an **employer** with the
**ordinary CNSS** obligations: percentage contributions on **real salary**, split
**employer / employee**, with a **ceiling** on some branches. This is **separate** from
the owner's own TNS/AE cover and is handled below in §3c.

---

## 3. Base, Rates & Minimums

### 3a. TNS (regulated/independent professions)

Contributions are computed on a **forfaitaire (flat) base** set by the worker's
**category décret**, indexed to the **SMIG**, in a band of roughly **1.75× to 2.75×
SMIG**. A TNS may, on registration, **opt for a higher base** than the category default,
and may **change the base once a year** (request filed ~60 days before it takes effect)
*(verify)*.

| Regime | Rate (active) | Base |
|---|---|---|
| **AMO** (health) | **6.37%** *(verify)* | Forfaitaire base (1.75×–2.75× SMIG) |
| **Retraite** (pension) | **10%** *(verify)* | Same forfaitaire base |
| **AMO** (pensioners) | **4.52%** of base pensions *(verify)* | Pension, precompted by the payer |

**Formula:**

```
Monthly TNS contribution = forfaitaire base × (AMO rate + retraite rate)
                         ≈ base × (6.37% + 10%)        (verify both rates)
```

> The AMO and retraite are **distinct regimes** with distinct décrets; retraite
> enrolment timing has been **phased** after AMO for some categories. Confirm whether
> the user's category is in **both** AMO and retraite yet.

### 3b. Auto-entrepreneurs

The auto-entrepreneur base is derived **from turnover**, not from a category forfait:

- **Services (prestations):** base ≈ **50% of collected turnover** *(verify)*.
- **Commercial / industrial / artisanal:** base ≈ **20% of collected turnover**
  *(verify)*.

The CNSS applies the TNS rates (AMO + retraite) to that derived base, and the result is
**collected quarterly with the tax** via the AE portal. The scheme is commonly described
through **fixed brackets (tranches) T1–T8**, each with a set quarterly amount.

- A **minimum** applies even at **zero turnover** — cited as **~MAD 300/quarter
  (≈ MAD 1,200/year)** *(verify)*.
- The **annual** contribution is cited in a range of **MAD 1,200 to ~14,400** depending
  on turnover *(verify the current bracket table)*.
- AMO benefits start after a **3-month stage (waiting period)** from the first
  contribution *(verify)*.

> **Default:** when the exact bracket amount is unknown, quote the **~MAD 300/quarter**
> floor and send the user to **cnss.ma / ae.gov.ma** for their bracket. Do **not**
> invent a T1–T8 amount. See `ma-auto-entrepreneur` for the full AE picture.

### 3c. Employee CNSS (employer / employee split) — for those who hire

Ordinary employee social charges in 2026 total roughly **27.83%** of gross salary,
split **employer ~21.09% / employee ~6.74%** *(verify)*. Critically, **some branches
are capped** and **some are not**:

| Branch | Capped at MAD 6,000/month? | Notes *(all rates verify)* |
|---|---|---|
| Prestations sociales (short + long term, incl. base pension) | **Yes** — capped | Employee ~4.48%; employer ~8.98% on the capped salary |
| AMO (health) | **No** — whole salary | Employee ~2.26%; employer ~2.26% base + AMO Solidarité ~1.85% |
| Allocations familiales (family allowances) | **No** — whole salary | Employer ~6.40% |
| Taxe de formation professionnelle (TFP) | **No** — whole salary | Employer ~1.60% |

> The **MAD 6,000/month ceiling** applies **only** to the capped (prestations
> sociales) branch. AMO, family allowances, and TFP are computed on the **full**
> salary. This is the central contrast with the self-employed: the **TNS base is a
> SMIG-indexed forfait**, whereas the **employee base is real salary, partly capped**.

## 4. Registration & Payment

### TNS / regulated professions

1. Affiliate with **CNSS** under the décret for your **category** (some ordres
   professionnels coordinate this).
2. CNSS assigns the **forfaitaire base**; you may **opt up** to a higher base.
3. **Declare and pay quarterly**, online via **cnss.ma** *(verify portal/dates)*.

### Auto-entrepreneurs

1. Registration in the **RNAE** (rn.ae.gov.ma, Poste Maroc / Al Barid Bank)
   **automatically** triggers CNSS affiliation.
2. Social contribution is **collected quarterly alongside the impôt libératoire** via
   the AE portal — including **nil (néant)** quarters.
3. AMO benefits begin after the **3-month stage**.

### Employers (those who hire)

1. Register the **business** as an employer with CNSS and obtain the **affiliation
   number**.
2. **Declare and pay monthly** via **DAMANCOM** (teledeclaration), withholding the
   employee share from payroll *(verify deadline — typically before the end of the
   month following the period)*.

> A self-employed person who hires staff has **two** distinct CNSS relationships: their
> **own** TNS/AE cover **and** the **employer** obligation for staff. Keep them separate.

---

## 5. Worked Examples

> All figures use the 2026 rates/bases flagged "verify". Recompute with the confirmed
> category décret values and current SMIG before relying on them.

### Example 1 — TNS regulated professional (forfaitaire base)

Dr. Amine is a self-employed doctor (TNS). His category décret sets a forfaitaire base
of, say, **2× SMIG ≈ MAD 6,223/month** *(verify the exact category base)*.

- **AMO** = 6,223 × 6.37% ≈ **MAD 396/month** *(verify rate)*.
- **Retraite** = 6,223 × 10% ≈ **MAD 622/month** *(verify rate)*.
- **Total ≈ MAD 1,018/month**, paid **quarterly** (≈ MAD 3,055/quarter).
- Flag: confirm the **exact forfaitaire base** in the medical-profession décret — the
  2× SMIG used here is **illustrative**.

### Example 2 — Auto-entrepreneur, services (turnover-linked)

Sara is an auto-entrepreneur web developer (services). Quarterly collected turnover
**MAD 60,000**.

- Social base ≈ **50% × 60,000 = MAD 30,000** for the quarter *(verify the 50%)*.
- CNSS applies the AMO + retraite rates to that base, **placing her in a T1–T8 bracket**
  — quote the **bracket amount from cnss.ma / ae.gov.ma**, not a computed guess.
- Even a **zero-turnover** quarter still owes the **~MAD 300 minimum** *(verify)*.
- Cross-reference `ma-auto-entrepreneur` for the parallel **impôt libératoire** (1% for
  services) collected at the same time.

### Example 3 — Self-employed person who hires one employee (employer split)

Khadija runs a CPU micro-business (own TNS cover via `ma-cpu`) and hires **one
assistant** at **MAD 8,000/month** gross.

- For the assistant, the **capped branch** uses **MAD 6,000** (the ceiling), the
  **uncapped branches** use the **full MAD 8,000**:
  - Employee prestations sociales ≈ 6,000 × 4.48% ≈ **MAD 269** *(verify)*.
  - Employee AMO ≈ 8,000 × 2.26% ≈ **MAD 181** *(verify)* → withheld from pay.
  - Employer prestations ≈ 6,000 × 8.98% ≈ **MAD 539**; employer family allowances
    ≈ 8,000 × 6.40% ≈ **MAD 512**; employer AMO + TFP on full salary *(verify all
    rates)*.
- Khadija files this **monthly via DAMANCOM**. Her **own** social cover stays under the
  **CPU/TNS** track — it is **not** part of the employee computation.

---

## 6. Tier 2 — Reviewer Judgement Required

Escalate to the **Moroccan expert-comptable** reviewer when:

- The user's **profession's roll-out status** or **effective date** is uncertain (is
  the category in AMO yet? in retraite yet?).
- The **exact forfaitaire base** for the category must be read off a specific décret.
- A TNS wants to **opt up** to a higher base, or change the base, and needs the pension
  trade-off modelled.
- The user **hires staff** — full employer payroll/CNSS setup, DAMANCOM, and the
  capped/uncapped branch allocation (see `payroll`-type work).
- **Auto-entrepreneur ceiling breach** or exit (re-route via `ma-auto-entrepreneur` /
  `ma-cpu` / `ma-income-tax`), including how social cover changes on exit.
- **Cross-border / detachement** (a TNS working abroad, or a foreign self-employed
  person in Morocco) and CNSS social-security agreements.
- **Arrears, benefit eligibility, or the 3-month AMO stage / pension vesting** (3,240
  days) disputes.
- Any number where the agent had to fall back to a **"verify"** value or an
  **illustrative** base.

The agent must **never** present these as settled; it presents the computation, the
assumptions, and the open items for the reviewer to sign off.

### Short test suite

1. **Q:** TNS doctor, category base = 2× SMIG. **A:** AMO 6.37% + retraite 10% on the
   **category forfaitaire base** *(verify base and rates)*; paid quarterly.
2. **Q:** Auto-entrepreneur, services, zero turnover this quarter. **A:** Still owes the
   **~MAD 300 minimum** *(verify)*; AMO benefits only after the 3-month stage.
3. **Q:** Auto-entrepreneur, commercial. **A:** Base ≈ **20% of turnover** *(verify)*;
   bracket amount from cnss.ma — do **not** compute a guess.
4. **Q:** Employee paid MAD 10,000/month — what's capped? **A:** Only the **prestations
   sociales** branch is capped at **MAD 6,000**; **AMO, family allowances, TFP** apply to
   the **full** salary *(verify rates)*.
5. **Q:** Which rate split for employees? **A:** Total ≈ **27.83%**, employer ≈ 21.09% /
   employee ≈ 6.74% *(verify)*.
6. **Q:** Is a freelance graphic designer's profession "rolled out" yet? **A:** Default
   to **mandatory**; confirm the **category décret** and effective date on cnss.ma —
   escalate (Tier 2).
7. **Q:** Self-employed CPU payer hires staff. **A:** Two relationships — own **CPU/TNS**
   cover (`ma-cpu`) **plus** ordinary **employer CNSS** via **DAMANCOM** for the staff.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** transplant one category's **forfaitaire base** onto another — each TNS
  category has its **own décret base**.
- **Do NOT** invent auto-entrepreneur **T1–T8 bracket** amounts — quote the **~MAD 300
  minimum** floor and send the user to cnss.ma / ae.gov.ma.
- **Do NOT** apply the **MAD 6,000 ceiling** to AMO, family allowances, or the training
  tax — the ceiling is **only** for the capped prestations-sociales branch.
- **Do NOT** conflate **TNS / auto-entrepreneur** self-cover with the **employer/employee**
  computation — a person who hires has **both**, computed separately.
- **Do NOT** assume "no income → no contribution" — a **minimum** applies regardless.
- **Do NOT** state any rate, base multiple, ceiling, SMIG, or minimum as final without
  the **"verify current value"** caveat against the **Loi de Finances 2026** and the
  relevant **décret**.
- **Do NOT** advise on **employee payroll mechanics, IR withholding, TVA, or company
  forms** under this skill — route to the relevant skill (`ma-income-tax`,
  `morocco-vat`, etc.).
- **Do NOT** confirm a profession's **roll-out / effective date** without checking
  cnss.ma — escalate if uncertain.
- **Do NOT** issue any filing or computation as final without **Moroccan
  expert-comptable** sign-off.
