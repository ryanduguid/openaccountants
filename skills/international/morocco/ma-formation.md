# Morocco — Business Formation & Registration for the Self-Employed

This skill walks a self-employed person through **starting and registering** a
business in Morocco: which legal status to adopt (**auto-entrepreneur**, a sole
trader under **CPU / RNR / RNS**, or a one-person company **SARL-AU**), and which
identifiers and tax registrations follow. The four identifiers that recur across
every Moroccan business are:

- **ICE** — *Identifiant Commun de l'Entreprise* — a 15-digit universal business ID
  used by all administrations (DGI, CNSS, OMPIC, customs).
- **IF** — *Identifiant Fiscal* — the tax identifier issued by the **DGI**.
- **RC** — *Registre de Commerce* — commercial-register number (commerçants only).
- **TP** — *taxe professionnelle*, the local business tax formerly called the
  **patente**.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (auto-entrepreneur, ICE, IF, RC, patente, CRI,
OMPIC, DGI, CNSS) and explain them in the chosen language. It is a **formation /
registration** skill; for ongoing tax computation route to `ma-auto-entrepreneur`,
`ma-cpu`, `ma-income-tax`, `morocco-vat`, and `ma-social-contributions`.

### Conservative defaults

When data is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative default** and flag it
for the reviewer:

- **Activity type unknown** → ask whether the activity is **commercial**
  (commerçant → needs **RC**) or a **prestation de services / profession
  libérale** (often no RC, but still needs **IF + ICE + TP**).
- **Profession possibly regulated** → assume it **needs prior authorisation / ordre
  professionnel** and is **excluded** from auto-entrepreneur until proven
  otherwise.
- **Regime not chosen** → do **not** auto-select; lay out auto-entrepreneur vs CPU
  vs RNR/RNS and route the tax detail to the dedicated skill.
- **Near a ceiling** (AE/CPU/VAT) → assume the ceiling **is or will be breached**
  and warn about the consequences (exit, VAT registration).
- **Any rate, threshold, fee, or deadline** → present as *indicative* and append
  **"verify against the Loi de Finances 2026 and the DGI / OMPIC"**.

## 2. Registering as an Auto-Entrepreneur (statut de l'auto-entrepreneur)

The **auto-entrepreneur (AE)** status (Loi 114-13) is the lightest path for an
individual freelancer or micro-trader. Registration is through the **RNAE**
(Registre National de l'Auto-Entrepreneur), operated by **Poste Maroc / Al Barid
Bank** on the portal **`rn.ae.gov.ma`** (commonly written **ae.gov.ma**).

**Who can use it.** A physical person whose annual turnover stays under
**MAD 500,000** (commercial/industrial/artisanal) or **MAD 200,000** (services),
and whose activity is **not on the excluded list** of regulated/liberal professions
*(verify list)*.

**Steps.**

1. **Create an account** on `rn.ae.gov.ma` (CIN/national-ID based).
2. **Fill the online form** — identity, activity (with its code), and the
   commune/address. Takes ~15–30 minutes.
3. **Upload / prepare documents** — typically CIN, a photo, and proof of address
   *(verify the current checklist on the portal)*.
4. **File the dossier physically** at a **Poste Maroc / Al Barid Bank** branch (or
   sometimes a CRI) to validate it.
5. **Receive the AE registration number** (carte d'auto-entrepreneur) — usually
   within **24–72 hours** *(verify)*. **Registration is free** *(verify)*.
6. **Automatic CNSS affiliation** — since 2021, RNAE registration triggers
   affiliation to the CNSS non-salarié (AMO) scheme. See `ma-social-contributions`.

**What you get.** An AE number that doubles as your business identity; you obtain an
**ICE** and an **IF** in the process (the AE is in the DGI system). You generally do
**not** need a full **RC** registration as an auto-entrepreneur *(verify for
commercial activities)*.

**Tax under AE.** Liberatory IR on **collected** turnover — **0.5%**
(commercial/industrial/artisanal) or **1%** (services). Full detail and the
single-client anti-disguised-salary rule live in **`ma-auto-entrepreneur`**.

> Route all AE tax computation, ceiling-breach handling, and the 80,000-MAD
> single-client withholding to **`ma-auto-entrepreneur`** — this skill only covers
> the *registration*.

## 3. ICE / IF / RC / Taxe Professionnelle

These are the core identifiers and the first local tax. For a **company**, the CRI
one-stop window produces them together; for an **individual**, they come from the
DGI (and the RC tribunal where the activity is commercial).

### 3.1 ICE — Identifiant Commun de l'Entreprise

- A **15-digit** universal ID (9 entity digits + 4 establishment digits + 2 control
  digits) used by **all** administrations. Mandatory on invoices.
- **New company** → ICE is **attributed by OMPIC** when you request the *certificat
  négatif* (name reservation).
- **New individual / sole trader** → **DGI** attributes the ICE and prints it on the
  **bulletin IF / TP**.
- **Existing business** without an ICE → recover/generate it at **`ice.gov.ma`**
  using your IF, RC, or CNSS number; a PDF certificate is produced *(verify)*.

### 3.2 IF — Identifiant Fiscal

- The tax identifier issued by the **DGI** (Direction Générale des Impôts).
- Obtained at registration with the DGI tax office of the activity's location, or
  automatically through the **CRI** for a company. Required for IR/IS, VAT, and to
  invoice.

### 3.3 RC — Registre de Commerce

- The **commercial register**, kept by the **Tribunal de Commerce**, governed by the
  **Code de Commerce (Loi 15-95)**.
- **Required for commerçants** (commercial/industrial activities). Many pure
  **prestataires de services / professions libérales** and **auto-entrepreneurs**
  do **not** register in the RC *(verify per activity)*.
- Two forms: **RC analytique** (the local court's number) and the **RC central**
  kept by **OMPIC**.

### 3.4 Taxe professionnelle (ex-patente)

- The **taxe professionnelle (TP)** — historically the **patente** — is a **local
  tax** on those carrying on a profession/business (Loi 47-06 on local taxation).
- **Base:** the **rental value** of premises and business fixed assets; **rate band
  ~10%–30%** *(verify)*.
- **New-business exemption:** **5 years** of full exemption from the start of
  activity, applied **automatically** *(verify)* — a key reason new businesses owe
  little local tax at the outset.
- Paid alongside the **taxe de services communaux (TSC)**.
- Note: **CPU** taxpayers and (effectively) **auto-entrepreneurs** are **exempt /
  outside** the TP under their own regimes — see Section 4 and `ma-cpu`.

---

## 4. Choosing the Regime at Registration + VAT

The status you register under determines which **income-tax regime** applies. Lay
out the options; do **not** auto-pick.

### 4.1 The four routes

| Route | Who | Tax base | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-entrepreneur** | Individual under the AE ceilings, non-excluded activity | **0.5% / 1%** liberatory on **collected** turnover | Lightest; CNSS bundled. → `ma-auto-entrepreneur` |
| **CPU** (Contribution Professionnelle Unique) | Individual, turnover ≤ **MAD 500,000** (comm./ind./artisanal) or ≤ **200,000** (services), not on excluded list | **10%** on **turnover × profession coefficient** + droit complémentaire | Replaces forfait; **exempt from TP & TSC**. → `ma-cpu` |
| **RNR** (Résultat Net Réel) | Higher turnover or by election | **Net profit**, progressive IR scale | Full accounting. → `ma-income-tax` |
| **RNS** (Résultat Net Simplifié) | Mid-range turnover | Simplified net profit, progressive IR | → `ma-income-tax` |

**Decision pointers.**
- Very small, expense-light freelancing → **auto-entrepreneur** is usually simplest.
- Small trade/craft with a known profession coefficient → compare **CPU**.
- Significant expenses, or activity excluded from AE/CPU, or above ceilings →
  **RNR / RNS**.
- A **regulated / liberal profession** (doctor, lawyer, architect, notaire,
  accountant, etc.) is generally **excluded from AE and CPU** and needs its
  **ordre professionnel / authorisation** — route to `ma-income-tax`.

### 4.2 Regulated professions & authorisations

Before registering, confirm the activity does not require **prior authorisation** or
membership of an **ordre / syndicat professionnel** (e.g. health, legal, accounting,
engineering, transport, food handling). If it might, **default to "needs
authorisation"** and flag it — the legal status cannot be finalised until the
profession's own licence is obtained.

### 4.3 VAT (TVA) registration

- **Auto-entrepreneurs / CPU** small operators are typically **outside VAT** under
  the franchise thresholds — **MAD 500,000** (comm./ind./artisanal) / **MAD
  200,000** (services) of turnover *(verify CGI)*.
- **Above the threshold**, or for **companies (SARL/SA) from creation**, VAT applies
  — standard rate **20%**, with reduced rates (e.g. 10%, 0% on exports) *(verify the
  2026 rate convergence)*.
- VAT registration is part of the DGI/IF process; declarations are **monthly** or
  **quarterly** via **SIMPL-TVA**. Detail lives in **`morocco-vat`**.

## 5. SARL / SARL-AU Overview (CRI / OMPIC)

A self-employed person who wants **limited liability** or to scale beyond the
individual regimes usually forms a **SARL** (multi-partner) or **SARL-AU** /
**SARL-associé unique** (one-person LLC, the Moroccan EURL). Companies are formed
through the **CRI guichet unique** (regional one-stop window) with **OMPIC**.

**Typical steps (CRI single window).**

1. **Certificat négatif** — reserve the company name with **OMPIC** (small fee,
   ~MAD 230) *(verify)*. The **ICE** is attributed here.
2. **Draft the statuts** (articles of association); notarised or under private
   signature.
3. **Deposit capital** — **no legal minimum** since Loi 24-10; if capital **>
   MAD 100,000**, block **≥ 1/4** in a bank account in the company-in-formation's
   name *(verify)*.
4. **Register at the CRI** — RC registration (Tribunal de Commerce), IF (DGI), TP,
   and CNSS affiliation are processed together.
5. **Legal publications** — Bulletin Officiel + a journal d'annonces légales
   *(fees vary)*.

**Indicative cost & timing.** ~**MAD 5,000–15,000** excluding capital; ~**10–15
working days** via the CRI one-stop window *(verify — varies by region and adviser)*.

**Tax of a SARL/SARL-AU.** A company is generally subject to **corporate income tax
(IS)**, not the individual IR regimes, and is **VAT-registered from creation**. That
shifts the engagement out of the self-employed individual scope — flag that company
taxation (IS) is **outside this skill set** and needs an **expert-comptable**.

## 6. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Freelance graphic designer, Casablanca

- **Facts:** Individual, services, expects ~MAD 120,000/year, no employees, no shop.
- **Status:** Eligible for **auto-entrepreneur** (under the 200,000 services
  ceiling; design is not a regulated profession — *verify*).
- **Steps:** Register on **`rn.ae.gov.ma`** → file dossier at Poste Maroc → AE
  number in ~24–72 h (free). Obtains **ICE + IF** via the RNAE/DGI; CNSS affiliation
  automatic.
- **Tax:** **1%** liberatory IR on collected turnover (→ `ma-auto-entrepreneur`).
- **VAT:** **Below MAD 200,000** → outside VAT *(verify)*.
- **TP:** Effectively outside the patente under the AE regime.
- **Flag:** Confirm the activity is not on the AE excluded list; verify all figures
  against the Loi de Finances 2026.

### Example 2 — Two partners opening an e-commerce trading company

- **Facts:** Two associés, expected turnover ~MAD 1,500,000, want limited liability.
- **Status:** **SARL** via the **CRI guichet unique**.
- **Steps:** Certificat négatif at OMPIC (ICE attributed) → statuts → no minimum
  capital but plan working capital → RC + IF + TP + CNSS at the CRI → legal
  publications. ~10–15 working days; ~MAD 5,000–15,000 excl. capital *(verify)*.
- **Tax:** Corporate **IS** + **VAT from creation** (turnover well above 500,000) →
  **outside this skill** — route to an expert-comptable and `morocco-vat`.
- **TP:** **5-year new-business exemption** applies automatically, then the ~10%–30%
  band on rental value *(verify)*.
- **Flag:** Company taxation is out of scope here; confirm all costs/timing with the
  CRI and an expert-comptable.

### Short test suite

1. **Q:** Web freelancer, services, CA ~MAD 90,000, wants the simplest setup.
   **A:** **Auto-entrepreneur** via `rn.ae.gov.ma` (free, ~24–72 h); ICE+IF
   obtained; outside VAT; → `ma-auto-entrepreneur`.
2. **Q:** "What is the ICE and how many digits?" **A:** *Identifiant Commun de
   l'Entreprise*, **15 digits**, universal across administrations; from **OMPIC**
   (companies) or **DGI** (individuals); recover at `ice.gov.ma`.
3. **Q:** Pure services provider — do they need an RC? **A:** **Often no** — RC is
   for **commerçants**; services/professions libérales usually skip RC but still
   need **IF + ICE + TP** *(verify per activity)*.
4. **Q:** "How long is the patente exemption for a new business?" **A:** **5 years**
   from start of activity, automatic (taxe professionnelle) *(verify)*.
5. **Q:** Lawyer wants to register as auto-entrepreneur. **A:** **Excluded**
   (regulated/liberal profession needs the ordre); route to `ma-income-tax`.
6. **Q:** SARL minimum capital? **A:** **No legal minimum** since Loi 24-10;
   blocking only if capital **> MAD 100,000** *(verify)*.
7. **Q:** Activity commercial vs services unknown. **A:** **Ask** — it changes RC
   requirement, the AE/CPU ceiling (500k vs 200k), and the VAT threshold.
8. **Q:** Trader expects CA MAD 1.2M. **A:** Over AE/CPU ceilings → **RNR/RNS** (or
   SARL); **VAT applies** — route to `ma-income-tax` + `morocco-vat`.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** auto-select a **legal status or tax regime** — present
  auto-entrepreneur vs CPU vs RNR/RNS vs SARL and let the user choose; the choice
  drives RC, VAT, and TP outcomes.
- **Do NOT** confirm a **regulated / liberal profession** as eligible for
  auto-entrepreneur or CPU — **default to excluded / needs authorisation** and route
  to `ma-income-tax`.
- **Do NOT** state any **fee, ceiling, threshold, rate, or processing time** as
  final — they change with the Loi de Finances and by region; append **"verify
  against the Loi de Finances 2026 and the DGI / OMPIC / CRI"**.
- **Do NOT** assume a **services** provider needs an **RC** — RC is for
  **commerçants**; verify per activity.
- **Do NOT** claim a business is **outside VAT** without checking the activity-type
  threshold (500,000 vs 200,000) — and remember **companies are VAT-liable from
  creation**.
- **Do NOT** invent the **AE/CPU excluded-professions list** or a **profession
  coefficient** — read them from the official RNAE list / CGI annex.
- **Do NOT** compute **corporate tax (IS)** or full company tax under this skill —
  flag it as out of scope and route to an expert-comptable.
- **Do NOT** provide **AE / CPU / VAT / income-tax computation** here — route to
  `ma-auto-entrepreneur`, `ma-cpu`, `morocco-vat`, `ma-income-tax`, and
  `ma-social-contributions`.
- **Do NOT** treat this skill's output as a **filed registration** — final
  registration and any tax position require **Moroccan expert-comptable** sign-off.
