# Morocco — Legitimate Tax Optimization for the Self-Employed (Optimisation Fiscale Légale)

This skill helps a self-employed person in Morocco — a freelancer, sole trader,
or independent professional (**travailleur indépendant**) — pay **the least tax
the law allows**, by choosing the right regime and using lawful levers. It is
**planning, not evasion**. Every technique here is grounded in the **Code Général
des Impôts (CGI)** and the **Loi de Finances 2026**, administered by the
**Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI)**.

The decisive idea: a self-employed person in Morocco is taxed under the **Impôt
sur le Revenu (IR)**, but *how* the taxable base is built depends entirely on the
**régime fiscal** chosen. The same MAD 300,000 of turnover can produce wildly
different tax depending on whether it is taxed as a flat percentage of turnover
(auto-entrepreneur), turnover × a profession coefficient (CPU), or actual net
profit on the progressive IR scale (RNS / RNR). Optimization is mostly the art of
matching the regime to the **turnover** and the **margin**.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (auto-entrepreneur, CPU, RNS, RNR, IR, TVA, CNSS,
cotisation minimale, DGI) and explain them in the user's chosen language.

> **Cross-references.** For the mechanics of each regime, defer to the dedicated
> skills: **ma-auto-entrepreneur** (the 0.5% / 1% turnover status and its CNSS/AMO
> cover), **ma-cpu** (the Contribution Professionnelle Unique), and
> **ma-income-tax** (the IR scale, RNS/RNR net-profit regimes, and deductions).
> This skill sits *above* them and helps choose between them.

### Conservative defaults

When the facts are incomplete, default to the **safer, more conservative** answer
and tell the user to verify:

- **Default to the regime that survives audit, not the one with the lowest
  headline number.** A regime that minimizes tax but exposes the client to
  requalification (e.g. disguised employment) is not optimization — it is risk.
- **Treat the 80,000 MAD single-client situation as a red flag** until the
  relationship is shown to be genuinely independent.
- **Assume VAT applies** to services above the relevant threshold unless an
  exclusion or exemption is clearly established.
- **Assume the standard cotisation minimale applies** once the new-business window
  closes, unless a reduced rate or exemption is confirmed.
- Where a figure is marked **"verify"**, state it as provisional and tell the user
  to confirm with the DGI or an **expert-comptable** before relying on it.

## 2. Choosing the Regime (the Core Optimization Decision)

A self-employed Moroccan has, broadly, three families of regime. The first lever
of optimization is picking the right one.

### 2.1 The three options at a glance

| Regime | Tax base | Headline rate | Best when | Key limit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-entrepreneur (AE)** | Turnover collected | 0.5% (goods) / 1% (services), liberatory | Low costs, high margin, turnover under the ceiling | MAD 500k / 200k ceilings; single-client 80k rule |
| **CPU** (Contribution Professionnelle Unique) | Turnover × profession coefficient | 10% liberatory on the coefficiented base (+ droit complémentaire) | Modest turnover above AE ceilings, no full accounts wanted | MAD 2,000,000 / 500,000 ceilings *(verify)* |
| **RNS / RNR** (net-profit) | Actual net profit (revenue − deductible expenses) | Progressive IR scale, 0%–37% | High real costs / thin margin, or turnover above CPU ceilings | Full bookkeeping; cotisation minimale floor |

> RNS (**Résultat Net Simplifié**) and RNR (**Résultat Net Réel**) both tax *real
> net profit* on the IR scale; RNR requires fuller accounting. See **ma-income-tax**.

### 2.2 The IR scale (the engine behind CPU and RNS/RNR)

| Annual taxable income (MAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 40,000 | 0% |
| 40,001 – 60,000 | 10% |
| 60,001 – 80,000 | 20% |
| 80,001 – 100,000 | 30% |
| 100,001 – 180,000 | 34% |
| above 180,000 | 37% |

(Loi de Finances 2026; unchanged from 2025. *Verify the bracket edges before
filing.*)

### 2.3 Break-even logic — turnover and margin are everything

Two variables drive the choice: **turnover (CA)** and **net margin** (profit ÷
turnover).

**Auto-entrepreneur is unbeatable when margin is high and costs are low.** Because
AE taxes *turnover* — not profit — at just 0.5% / 1%, a freelancer with almost no
deductible costs (a typical service freelancer: laptop, internet, software) pays a
tiny effective rate. On MAD 200,000 of services, AE IR is only **MAD 2,000** (1%).
No net-profit regime can match that, because even after deductions the IR scale
would tax most of that income at 30–37%.

**Net-profit (RNS/RNR) wins when margin is thin.** If a sole trader buys and
resells goods at a 10% margin, AE taxes the whole turnover, ignoring the 90% that
went to suppliers. Here the net-profit regime — which deducts the cost of goods —
produces a far smaller base. The crossover happens when **real deductible costs
are large enough that net profit × IR-scale rate < turnover × AE rate**.

**CPU sits in the middle.** It is the natural home for someone who has outgrown
the AE ceilings but still has modest turnover and does not want full RNR
accounting. The coefficient is meant to *approximate* a realistic margin for the
profession, then 10% is applied.

**A practical decision rule:**

1. **Turnover within AE ceiling (200k services / 500k goods) AND high margin AND
   not dependent on a single client?** → **Auto-entrepreneur** is almost always
   the lowest legal tax.
2. **Turnover above the AE ceiling but within the CPU ceiling, margin roughly in
   line with the profession coefficient?** → **CPU**.
3. **Thin margin (high real costs), OR turnover above CPU ceilings, OR you want to
   deduct genuine business expenses (rent, salaries, equipment)?** → **RNS / RNR**
   on the IR scale.

> **Margin sensitivity check.** Always recompute. AE's appeal collapses as margin
> falls: at a 20% net margin, 1% of turnover equals 5% of profit — cheap. At a 5%
> margin, 1% of turnover equals 20% of profit — and a net-profit regime that
> deducts real costs may now beat it. Run the actual numbers for the client's CA
> and margin before recommending.

## 3. The 80,000 MAD Single-Client Rule & Disguised-Employment Risk

This is the single most important compliance trap in Moroccan freelance
optimization — and the one where naive "optimization" tips into illegality.

### 3.1 What the rule says

For an **auto-entrepreneur providing services**, the portion of annual turnover
billed to **the same client** that exceeds **MAD 80,000** is **no longer** taxed
at the favourable 1% liberatory rate. Instead, the client is required to apply a
**30% withholding** on the excess (introduced by the Loi de Finances 2023, in
force in 2026). The 1% rate continues to apply only up to MAD 80,000 per client.

### 3.2 Why it exists — the anti-disguised-salary purpose

The rule targets **disguised employment (salariat déguisé)**: companies replacing
salaried staff with auto-entrepreneurs to dodge payroll tax, CNSS contributions,
and Labour Code obligations. A "freelancer" who works full-time for one employer,
under that employer's direction, looks like an employee. The 80,000 MAD threshold
plus 30% withholding removes the tax advantage of that arrangement.

### 3.3 How to plan around it — *legitimately*

The lawful response is **not** to hide the relationship or split invoices across
shell entities — that is evasion and is prohibited (see PROHIBITIONS). The
legitimate options are:

- **Genuinely diversify the client base.** If the freelancer really serves several
  clients, no single one breaches 80,000 MAD and the rule simply does not bite.
  This is the cleanest path and reflects a true independent business.
- **Accept the withholding and move to the right regime.** If income from one
  client legitimately exceeds 80,000 MAD, the AE status may simply be the wrong
  tool. Re-run the break-even (Section 2): **CPU** or **RNS/RNR** may now be both
  lawful and more efficient than AE plus 30% withholding.
- **If the relationship is, in substance, employment, treat it as employment.**
  The honest answer is sometimes a salaried contract (with CNSS and the IR
  withholding on wages). Recommending this is good advice, not a failure.

### 3.4 The disguised-employment red flags the DGI looks for

Flag the risk to the client if the arrangement shows:

- A **single dominant client** providing most or all income.
- **Subordination**: fixed hours, the client's premises/equipment, the client's
  direction and supervision.
- **No real business autonomy**: no other clients, no own tools, no commercial
  risk, no ability to refuse work.
- **Continuity** mimicking permanent employment.

If several of these are present, **warn the client**: the DGI (and the labour
authorities / CNSS) can **requalify** the relationship as employment, with back
taxes, social contributions, and penalties. Optimization stops where substance
says "employee".

---

## 4. Cotisation Minimale / New-Business / VAT Levers

Beyond regime choice, three lawful levers move the tax bill.

### 4.1 Cotisation minimale (CM) — the floor under net-profit regimes

Under **RNS / RNR**, even a low- or no-profit year owes a **cotisation minimale**:
a minimum tax computed on **turnover** (plus certain other income), not profit.
The **standard rate is 0.25%**; **professions libérales** face a higher rate
(reported at **4%** — *verify for the specific activity*). The CM matters for
optimization because it sets a *floor*: a net-profit regime never costs less than
the CM, so a very-low-margin business should compare AE/CPU against "RNS net-profit
tax, but never below the CM".

### 4.2 The new-business exemption — a real, time-limited lever

New taxpayers are **exempt from the cotisation minimale for the first 36 months**
of activity (CGI Art. 144). This is a genuine planning point: in the early,
loss-making or thin-margin years, a net-profit regime can be attractive because the
CM floor is switched off. Plan the regime choice with this 36-month window in mind,
and note when it expires (the CM floor then re-engages).

### 4.3 VAT (TVA) threshold management

Auto-entrepreneurs operate **outside the scope of VAT (hors champ de la TVA)**
while within their ceilings — they charge **no TVA**, which makes them cheaper to
non-recoverable clients (consumers, exempt businesses). This is a legitimate
competitive and cash-flow advantage.

Optimization levers:

- **Staying within the AE ceiling keeps you VAT-free.** Crossing the ceiling (or
  moving to CPU/RNS) generally brings you **into** VAT: you must register, charge
  TVA (standard **20%**, reduced **10%** for some services), file VAT returns, and
  keep accounts — but you also gain the **right to deduct input VAT** on purchases.
- **Optional VAT registration** can pay off when your clients are VAT-registered
  businesses (they reclaim the TVA you charge) and you carry significant input VAT
  (equipment, subcontractors). The option, once taken, is binding for a **minimum
  of 3 consecutive years** — so model it before opting in.
- **Do not artificially suppress turnover** to stay under a threshold (e.g.
  refusing real work, or pushing income off-book). Declining growth is a business
  choice; *concealing* turnover is evasion (see PROHIBITIONS).

### 4.4 Export & Casablanca Finance City (brief mention)

These are largely **corporate (IS)** incentives, but relevant when a freelancer
considers incorporating:

- **Export activities** benefit from preferential corporate treatment (historically
  a full IS exemption for the first years, then a reduced rate). A self-employed
  exporter selling services abroad should ask whether incorporating to access these
  reliefs is worthwhile — *verify current 2026 terms*.
- **Casablanca Finance City (CFC)** offers strong incentives for eligible companies
  (a multi-year IS exemption then a reduced **20%** rate, with CM relief in the
  early years). This is **company-level**, not for a bare sole trader, and eligibility
  is restrictive. Mention it only as a "consider incorporating" prompt and route the
  client to a specialist. *Verify all CFC terms against the Loi de Finances 2026.*

## 5. Worked Examples (3 Personas)

> Illustrative only. Figures rounded; confirm bracket edges and rates before filing.

### 5.1 Amine — high-margin solo developer (AE wins)

- **Activity:** freelance software developer, several clients (none above 80k).
- **Turnover:** MAD 180,000 (services). **Real costs:** ~MAD 15,000 (laptop,
  internet, SaaS) → margin ~92%.
- **Auto-entrepreneur:** 1% × 180,000 = **MAD 1,800** IR (liberatory), no VAT,
  no accounts. Within the 200,000 services ceiling.
- **RNS comparison:** net profit ≈ 165,000 → IR scale tax would be in the tens of
  thousands of dirhams. Far worse.
- **Recommendation:** **Auto-entrepreneur.** Keep clients diversified so the 80k
  single-client rule never bites. Monitor the 200,000 ceiling.

### 5.2 Khadija — single-client consultant (the 80k trap)

- **Activity:** consultant invoicing **one** company MAD 240,000/year.
- **Naive AE view:** "1% = MAD 2,400." **Wrong** — only the first 80,000 enjoys
  1%; the **MAD 160,000 excess from the same client** suffers **30% withholding**
  ≈ **MAD 48,000**. And the 240,000 turnover **exceeds the 200,000 services
  ceiling**, so AE is not even available beyond it.
- **Disguised-employment risk:** one client, likely subordination → high
  requalification risk.
- **Recommendation:** **(a)** if genuinely independent, move to **CPU or RNS** and
  re-run the numbers — likely cheaper than AE-plus-withholding and audit-safe;
  **(b)** if in substance an employee, advise a **salaried contract**. Do **not**
  split invoices or interpose entities to dodge the 80k rule.

### 5.3 Younes — low-margin trader (net-profit regime wins)

- **Activity:** buys and resells electronics. **Turnover:** MAD 1,200,000.
  **Cost of goods + costs:** MAD 1,080,000 → net profit ≈ **MAD 120,000**, margin
  ~10%.
- **AE:** unavailable — turnover far above the 500,000 goods ceiling.
- **CPU vs RNS:** under **RNS**, tax is on the **MAD 120,000 net profit** on the
  IR scale (≈ low-to-mid four figures up to the 34% band on the top slice), subject
  to the **cotisation minimale** floor (0.25% × 1,200,000 = **MAD 3,000**). Compare
  against the CPU coefficiented base.
- **New-business lever:** in his first 36 months, the **CM is waived**, improving
  the net-profit option in early years.
- **Recommendation:** a **net-profit regime (RNS/RNR)** that deducts the genuine
  cost of goods, with CPU as a fallback to model. VAT registration is required at
  this turnover — use input-VAT deduction on stock.

---

## 6. Risks & Red Flags

- **Disguised employment (salariat déguisé).** The biggest one. Single dominant
  client + subordination = requalification risk. See Section 3. Flag it; never
  facilitate it.
- **Splitting / fragmenting turnover** across several auto-entrepreneurs or fake
  entities to stay under ceilings or under the 80k rule — **abusive and illegal.**
- **Under-declaring turnover** or keeping income off-book to stay VAT-free or below
  a ceiling — **evasion**, not optimization.
- **Ceiling breach by stealth.** Exceeding the AE ceilings for **two consecutive
  years** triggers automatic transition to a higher regime from 1 January of the
  next year. Plan the transition; do not pretend it isn't happening.
- **Mismatched coefficient (CPU).** Choosing CPU when the real margin is far below
  the profession coefficient can *cost* tax — CPU is not automatically cheaper.
- **Forgetting the cotisation minimale floor** when modelling a net-profit regime.
- **Optional VAT lock-in.** The 3-year minimum commitment means a bad VAT election
  is sticky — model it first.
- **Treating "verify" figures as settled.** Bracket edges, ceilings, and reduced
  CM rates must be confirmed against the **Loi de Finances 2026** and the DGI.

## PROHIBITIONS

This skill provides **legal tax optimization only**. It must **never**:

- Advise, design, or facilitate **tax evasion** — under-declaring or concealing
  turnover/income, keeping cash off-book, or falsifying records.
- Help structure or disguise an **employment relationship** as freelancing to dodge
  payroll tax, CNSS, or Labour Code duties (**salariat déguisé**). Where the
  substance is employment, say so.
- Suggest **fragmenting turnover** across multiple auto-entrepreneurs, relatives, or
  sham entities to stay under ceilings or under the 80,000 MAD single-client rule.
- Recommend **artificial invoice-splitting**, backdating, or fictitious deductions.
- Present any **abusive arrangement** that fails a substance/economic-reality test as
  "optimization".
- State unverified figures as certain. Mark estimates **"verify"** and route the user
  to the DGI or an expert-comptable.

When a request crosses into evasion or disguised employment, **decline the unlawful
part, explain why, and offer the lawful alternative.**
