# Morocco — Record-Keeping & Bookkeeping for the Self-Employed (Comptabilité)

This skill tells an AI agent **what books, registers, and invoices** a self-employed
Moroccan taxpayer must keep, and **for how long** — organised by tax regime. It does
**not** compute the tax (that is `ma-auto-entrepreneur`, `ma-cpu`, and
`ma-income-tax`); it governs the underlying **comptabilité** and **facturation**.

The depth of obligation rises with the regime:

- **Auto-entrepreneur (AE)** — a simple register of receipts (registre des recettes);
  no double-entry accounting.
- **Contribution Professionnelle Unique (CPU)** — a register of receipts **and**
  purchases (registre des recettes et des achats), with supporting purchase
  vouchers; exempt from full accounting.
- **Résultat Net Simplifié (RNS) / Résultat Net Réel (RNR)** — full accounting
  (comptabilité régulière) under the **Code Général de Normalisation Comptable
  (CGNC)** and the **Code de Commerce**.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (comptabilité, CGNC, facture, ICE, registre, DGI,
SIMPL) and explain them in the user's chosen language.

### Conservative defaults

When the regime, activity, or threshold is missing or ambiguous, the agent applies
the **conservative default** and flags it for the reviewer:

- **Regime unknown** → assume the taxpayer must keep the **higher** standard
  (register of receipts **and** purchases, retain everything 10 years) until the
  regime is confirmed.
- **Turnover near a ceiling** → assume the ceiling is **breached** and warn that
  full accounting under the CGNC may become mandatory next year.
- **Invoice missing the client ICE (B2B)** → treat the invoice as **non-compliant**;
  warn that the buyer may lose deductibility of the charge and VAT.
- **E-invoicing dates** → never state a firm go-live date for a category; say the
  **implementing decree is pending** and the user must verify with the DGI.
- **Any figure marked *(verify)*** → present as provisional; the reviewer confirms
  against the current CGI / Loi de Finances 2026 before relying on it.

## 2. Records by Regime

The obligation scales with the regime. Match the taxpayer to a row, then apply the
records column.

| Regime | Core records required | Double-entry? | Legal frame |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Auto-entrepreneur (AE)** | Register of receipts (registre des recettes), invoices issued | No | Loi 114-13; CGI |
| **CPU** | Register of receipts **and** purchases + purchase vouchers | No | CGI Art. 145 bis *(verify)* |
| **RNS** | Full accounting (simplified presentation of statements) | Yes | CGNC; Code de Commerce |
| **RNR** | Full accounting (complete financial statements) | Yes | CGNC; Code de Commerce |

### 2.1 Auto-entrepreneur — register of receipts (registre des recettes)

- Keep a **chronological register of receipts** (turnover **collected**, day by day).
- **No expense deduction** — the impôt libératoire is on gross collected turnover,
  so there is no obligation to book purchases for tax.
- Still **issue invoices / receipts** to clients and keep copies; the ICE applies
  (see §3).
- **No** livre-journal, grand-livre, balance sheet, or income statement.

### 2.2 CPU — register of receipts and purchases (registre des recettes et des achats)

- Keep a **register recording, day by day**, both:
  - sums **collected** from sales, works, and services; and
  - sums **paid** for purchases, supported by **probative vouchers** (pièces
    justificatives probantes) — CGI **Art. 145 bis** *(verify article)*.
- The **model of the register and the recording rules** are set by regulation
  (voie réglementaire) — confirm the current official form *(verify)*.
- CPU taxpayers are **exempt from the full accounting** of CGI Art. 145, but the
  register and the duty to **justify purchases** remain.
- **No** double-entry accounting, balance sheet, or CGNC financial statements.

### 2.3 RNS / RNR — full accounting under the CGNC

Taxpayers under **Résultat Net Simplifié (RNS)** or **Résultat Net Réel (RNR)** must
keep a **régulière comptabilité** under the **CGNC** (made mandatory by the
accounting law, **Loi 9-88**, dahir 25 Dec 1992) and the **Code de Commerce**:

- **Livre-journal** (general journal) — entries recorded day by day.
- **Grand-livre** (general ledger) — postings by account.
- **Livre d'inventaire** (inventory book) — balance sheet and income statement of
  each year transcribed.
- Supporting **auxiliary journals and ledgers** as the size of the business needs.
- A **plan comptable** conforming to the CGNC; an annual **inventory**.

Difference between the two:

- **RNR** — complete financial statements and full accounting entries.
- **RNS** — same accounting foundation but a **simplified presentation** of the
  annual statements (abbreviated balance sheet / income statement) *(verify the
  exact reduced filing set against the current CGI)*.

> An **expert-comptable** or **comptable agréé** is typically engaged for RNS/RNR;
> the agent prepares and organises but does not substitute for the professional.

## 3. Invoicing Rules (ICE, Mandatory Mentions, E-Invoicing Roadmap)

### 3.1 The ICE — Identifiant Commun de l'Entreprise

- The **ICE** is a **15-digit** identifier (commonly **9 enterprise + 4
  establishment + 2 control key**) that must appear on invoices *(verify structure)*.
- It is **mandatory for the seller** and, in **B2B**, for the **client** as well.
- A **missing or invalid ICE** can cost the **buyer** the deductibility of the
  charge (IS/IR) and of the related VAT, and exposes the **seller** to a fine
  (reported as **MAD 100 per omission**, capped per fiscal year) *(verify amounts
  and article)*.

### 3.2 Mandatory mentions on an invoice (facture)

A compliant **facture** under **CGI Art. 145** generally carries *(verify the full
official list against the current CGI)*:

1. **Seller identity** — name / raison sociale, address, **IF** (identifiant fiscal),
   **taxe professionnelle (TP)**, **RC** (registre de commerce) where applicable,
   and **ICE**.
2. **Client identity** — name, address, and **ICE in B2B**.
3. A **sequential invoice number** (numérotation chronologique et continue).
4. **Date** of issue.
5. **Description, quantity, unit price** of goods/services.
6. **Price excl. VAT, VAT rate and amount, price incl. VAT** (HT / TVA / TTC), or
   the exemption / non-applicability mention where relevant.
7. **Payment terms** and any other regulated mention.

Auto-entrepreneurs and CPU taxpayers who are **outside VAT** still issue invoices
but mark them accordingly (e.g. **"TVA non applicable"**) *(verify the correct
wording and VAT status against ma-auto-entrepreneur / morocco-vat)*.

### 3.3 E-invoicing roadmap (facturation électronique) — STATUS PENDING

Morocco is moving to **mandatory e-invoicing**:

- **Legal basis** — **CGI Art. 145-IX** *(verify)*.
- **Model** — a **clearance / CTC** (Continuous Transaction Controls) system:
  invoices are **pre-validated by the DGI platform** before they reach the client
  *(verify)*.
- **Formats** — structured XML (**UBL 2.1** and **CII**); a plain PDF is not
  sufficient *(verify)*.
- **Phasing** — expected to start with **large enterprises (B2B)**, then extend to
  **SMEs / TPEs** and finally **B2C**.
- **CRITICAL STATUS:** as of **April 2026** the **implementing decree was not yet
  published** — so the **exact go-live dates, the category calendar, and the
  turnover thresholds are NOT confirmed.** Do **not** state a firm date for any
  taxpayer category. Tell the user the decree is pending and to **verify with the
  DGI** *(verify on publication of the décret / Loi de Finances texts)*.

---

## 4. Retention & SIMPL

### 4.1 Document retention — 10 years

- Taxpayers subject to **IS, IR, or TVA** must **keep all accounting documents and
  supporting documents** used to determine the tax base for **10 years** — **CGI
  Art. 211** *(verify)*.
- This covers the **registers** (AE, CPU), the **CGNC books** (RNS/RNR), **invoices
  issued and received**, **purchase vouchers**, bank statements, and contracts.
- Reported penalty for failure to retain: a **fixed fine of MAD 50,000 per fiscal
  year** *(verify amount and article)*.
- Keep records in a form that can be **produced on tax audit** (contrôle fiscal);
  for e-invoiced documents, retain the structured electronic original *(verify e-archiving rules once the decree publishes)*.

### 4.2 SIMPL teleservices (tax.gov.ma)

- **SIMPL** is the DGI's online portal for **télédéclaration** and **télépaiement**:
  **SIMPL-IR** (income tax), **SIMPL-TVA** (VAT), **SIMPL-IS** (corporate tax).
- **E-filing and e-payment have been mandatory since 1 January 2017** *(verify)*.
- The taxpayer **adheres** (adhésion) to obtain access codes; the portal lets users
  import accounting data to generate and file returns.
- Bookkeeping feeds SIMPL: the registers/accounts produce the figures that are
  **télédéclarés**. Auto-entrepreneurs file via the dedicated AE channel
  (see `ma-auto-entrepreneur`), not necessarily the general SIMPL flow *(verify)*.

## 5. Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Freelance graphic designer, auto-entrepreneur

- Activity: design services; turnover collected ≈ MAD 150,000/year (below the
  services ceiling).
- **Records:** a **register of receipts** only (date, client, amount collected).
  Issues invoices marked **"TVA non applicable"** with her **ICE** and IF; keeps
  copies. **No** purchase register required for tax, **no** CGNC accounts.
- **Retention:** keep the register and invoice copies **10 years**.
- Agent output: confirms AE register suffices; flags that if turnover exceeds the
  ceiling for **two consecutive years** she moves up a regime (verify ceiling in
  `ma-auto-entrepreneur`).

### Example 2 — Small retailer under CPU

- Activity: neighbourhood shop (commercial); under the CPU ceiling.
- **Records:** a **register of receipts and purchases** recording sales collected
  and purchases paid **day by day**, with **purchase vouchers** retained
  (CGI Art. 145 bis). **Exempt** from CGNC full accounting.
- Issues invoices/tickets with **ICE**; in **B2B** sales must also carry the
  **client's ICE**.
- **Retention:** register + vouchers + invoices **10 years**.
- Agent output: confirms register + purchase justification; warns that missing
  purchase vouchers undermine the regime and that breaching the ceiling two years
  running triggers **RNS/RNR full accounts** *(verify thresholds)*.

### Example 3 — Consultant who exceeded the ceiling → RNR

- Activity: IT consultant; turnover exceeded the service ceiling for two consecutive
  years, now under **RNR**.
- **Records:** must now keep **full accounting under the CGNC** — **livre-journal,
  grand-livre, livre d'inventaire**, a CGNC-compliant plan comptable, annual
  inventory, and complete financial statements; compliant invoices with **ICE**.
- Files via **SIMPL-IR** (and **SIMPL-TVA** if VAT-registered).
- **Retention:** all books and supporting documents **10 years**.
- Agent output: flags the **upgrade trigger**, recommends engaging an
  **expert-comptable**, and prepares the books for the professional to review and
  sign off.

---

## 6. Tier 2 — Reviewer Judgement Required

Escalate to the human **expert-comptable / comptable agréé** (do not auto-decide):

- **Which regime applies** and **whether a ceiling was breached for two consecutive
  years** — the trigger that forces CGNC full accounting.
- **The exact RNS reduced filing set** vs full RNR statements.
- **The official CPU register model** and acceptable purchase vouchers.
- **The exact, current ICE structure, invoice-mention list, and penalty amounts** —
  confirm against the live CGI / Loi de Finances 2026.
- **E-invoicing applicability and dates** — pending the implementing decree; never
  commit a taxpayer to a go-live date without DGI confirmation.
- **E-archiving** of electronic invoices and the audit-readiness of digital records.
- Any **VAT** classification on invoices — defer to `morocco-vat`.

## 7. Reference + Test Suite

### Legal & source references

- **CGI** (Code Général des Impôts) — Art. **145** (tenue de comptabilité / facture
  mentions), **145 bis** (register for forfait/CPU purchases), **145-IX**
  (e-invoicing basis), **211** (retention) — *all article numbers to verify against
  the current consolidated CGI and Loi de Finances 2026.*
- **CGNC** (Code Général de Normalisation Comptable) — accounting law **Loi 9-88**,
  dahir 25 Dec 1992 (livre-journal, grand-livre, livre d'inventaire).
- **Code de Commerce** — commercial books and registre de commerce.
- **Loi 114-13** — auto-entrepreneur status (see `ma-auto-entrepreneur`).
- **DGI** — tax.gov.ma; **SIMPL** teleservices; e-invoicing platform
  (`fatourati.gov.ma`) *(verify)*.
- Secondary commentary (PwC Morocco, Upsilon, Baker Tilly, Deloitte LF 2026) used
  for cross-checking — **not** primary authority.

### Short test suite

1. *"I'm an auto-entrepreneur — what do I need to keep?"* → register of receipts +
   invoice copies; no CGNC accounts; retain 10 years.
2. *"CPU shopkeeper — do I need full accounting?"* → no; register of receipts **and**
   purchases + vouchers (Art. 145 bis); exempt from CGNC full accounts.
3. *"When am I forced into full accounting?"* → broadly, when the CPU/RNS ceiling is
   exceeded **two consecutive years**, or on option/company form → CGNC books
   (verify thresholds).
4. *"What must be on my invoice?"* → CGI Art. 145 mentions incl. **ICE** (seller +
   B2B client), sequential number, date, HT/TVA/TTC.
5. *"Is e-invoicing mandatory now?"* → moving to mandatory CTC e-invoicing under CGI
   Art. 145-IX, but the **implementing decree is pending (April 2026)** — dates and
   thresholds **not confirmed**; verify with DGI.
6. *"How long do I keep records?"* → **10 years** (CGI Art. 211).
7. *"What is SIMPL?"* → DGI teleservices (SIMPL-IR/TVA/IS) for télédéclaration and
   télépaiement; e-filing mandatory since 2017.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** state a firm e-invoicing go-live date or category threshold — the
  implementing decree was **unpublished as of April 2026**; say it is **pending**
  and direct the user to the DGI.
- **Do NOT** tell an RNS/RNR taxpayer they may skip CGNC double-entry accounting.
- **Do NOT** tell an auto-entrepreneur they must keep CGNC books, a balance sheet,
  or a purchase ledger for tax — the AE keeps a **register of receipts** only.
- **Do NOT** confirm an invoice as compliant if the **ICE** (seller, or B2B client)
  is missing or invalid.
- **Do NOT** advise retention shorter than **10 years**.
- **Do NOT** quote ICE structure, invoice-mention lists, penalty amounts, or
  thresholds as settled — present items marked *(verify)* as provisional pending
  reviewer confirmation against the current CGI / Loi de Finances 2026.
- **Do NOT** compute the tax itself here — defer to `ma-auto-entrepreneur`,
  `ma-cpu`, `ma-income-tax`, and `morocco-vat`.
- **Do NOT** replace a licensed Moroccan **expert-comptable / comptable agréé**.
