# Morocco — E-Invoicing / Facturation Électronique (DGI)

Morocco is moving towards **mandatory electronic invoicing** (facturation
électronique / la facture électronique / الفوترة الإلكترونية), administered by the
**Direction Générale des Impôts (DGI)**. The legal hook is **Article 145-IX of the
Code Général des Impôts (CGI)**, which empowers the administration to require an
IT-based invoicing system meeting technical criteria set by regulation. The
operative detail — formats, thresholds, the platform, and the go-live dates — is to
be fixed by an **implementing decree (décret d'application)** that, as of the last
research update, had **not yet been published in the Bulletin Officiel**.

This skill replies in the user's language. Moroccan users mix English, French, and
Darija — keep the native terms (DGI, ICE, IF, TVA, SIMPL, facturation
électronique, CTC) and explain them once.

> **READ THIS FIRST.** Mandatory B2B/B2C e-invoicing in Morocco is an **announced
> roadmap, not a regime in force**. Do not tell a user they "must e-invoice from
> [date]" — the start dates, scope thresholds, and even the final clearance model
> are **pending the décret d'application**. What *is* already binding is (a) the
> paper/PDF invoice-conformity rules under CGI Art. 145, and (b) the SIMPL
> télédéclaration/télépaiement obligations. Anchor advice on those.

## 1. Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Topic | E-invoicing / facturation électronique |
| Authority | Direction Générale des Impôts (**DGI**), tax.gov.ma |
| Currency | **MAD** (dirham) |
| Legal basis | **CGI Art. 145-IX** (e-invoicing enabling provision); CGI Art. 145 (invoice mentions); Art. 146, 192, 198 ter (sanctions) |
| Status | **Roadmap — pending.** Implementing decree NOT yet published; go-live dates UNCONFIRMED |
| Announced model | Continuous Transaction Control (**CTC**) / pre-clearance — *verify in final decree* |
| Announced formats | UBL / CII (e.g. UBL 2.1) — *verify* |
| Platform | DGI national platform built by **xHub**, integrated with **Simpl-TVA**; public brand name (e.g. *fatourati.gov.ma*) **NOT confirmed** — verify |
| Already in force | SIMPL télédéclaration & télépaiement (mandatory for enterprises since 2017); ICE on invoices |
| Sequencing (announced) | Large companies (B2B) first → SMEs → small enterprises → B2C — *verify dates* |
| Quality tier | **Research-verified — pending sign-off by a Moroccan expert-comptable** |
| Tax year | 2026 |
| Version | 1.0 |
| Last research update | Mid-2026 |

### Conservative defaults

- **Default to "pending / verify."** If a user asks "when does it start" or "what
  format," answer with the *announced* position and immediately flag that the
  décret d'application is not yet published. Never present a date as settled law.
- **Default to current-law conformity.** Whatever happens with e-invoicing, an
  invoice that already satisfies CGI Art. 145 (ICE, IF, sequential numbering, TVA
  breakdown) is the safe baseline. Advise the user to fix paper/PDF conformity
  first.
- **Default to escalation for go-live decisions.** Onboarding to a clearance
  platform, choosing an OD/PDP-style provider, or changing the invoicing workflow
  is a reviewer decision once the decree lands — flag to an expert-comptable.
- **Never invent thresholds.** The turnover/headcount cut-offs for each wave are
  decree-defined and not yet public. Do not guess MAD figures.

## 2. Current Invoicing Rules (in force today)

These apply **now**, on paper or PDF, regardless of the e-invoicing roadmap. A
"regular invoice" (**facture régulière**) is the precondition for the customer's
right to deduct TVA and expenses (CGI Art. 146 / Art. 106). A missing or defective
mention is the single most common reason the DGI rejects deductible TVA on audit.

### Mandatory mentions (mentions obligatoires) — CGI Art. 145

The seller must show:

1. **Seller identification** — raison sociale / name, address, and the seller's
   **Identifiant Fiscal (IF)**, **Taxe Professionnelle (TP)** number, **Registre
   de Commerce (RC)** number where applicable, and the **ICE**.
2. **ICE — Identifiant Commun de l'Entreprise.** A **15-digit** common business
   identifier. The **seller's ICE** has been mandatory on invoices since 2016
   (CGI Art. 145-VIII). The **client's ICE** is mandatory in **B2B** transactions
   (since January 2019). Both ICEs on a B2B invoice is the rule.
3. **Customer identification** — name/raison sociale, address, and (B2B) the
   customer's ICE.
4. **Sequential invoice number** (numérotation chronologique et continue) — no
   gaps; a single uninterrupted series.
5. **Date** of issue.
6. **Description** of goods/services, **quantity**, **unit price HT** (hors taxe).
7. **Total HT**, the **TVA rate(s)** and **TVA amount broken down by rate**
   (ventilation de la TVA par taux), and the **total TTC** (toutes taxes
   comprises).
8. **Terms / mode of payment** (modalités de paiement) where required.

> Native-term note: **HT** = hors taxe (net of VAT); **TTC** = toutes taxes
> comprises (VAT-inclusive); **TVA** = taxe sur la valeur ajoutée. Rates from 2026
> are principally **20%** and **10%** (7% and 14% phased out — see `morocco-vat`).

### Self-employed / auto-entrepreneur note

An **auto-entrepreneur** (statut AE) still issues conforming invoices and carries
an **ICE**. AE invoices are typically out of scope for TVA where the person is not
TVA-registered, but the Art. 145 identification and numbering rules still apply.
See `ma-auto-entrepreneur` for the regime and `morocco-vat` for TVA treatment.

## 3. The E-Invoicing Roadmap (status: UNCONFIRMED)

> Everything in this section is **announced / expected**, drawn from DGI
> communications, the PLF (projet de loi de finances) 2026 process, and Big-4 /
> vendor commentary. None of it is settled until the **décret d'application** is
> published in the **Bulletin Officiel**. Treat all dates as provisional.

### Legal mechanism

- **CGI Art. 145-IX** is the enabling provision: it lets the DGI mandate an
  IT-based invoicing system meeting technical criteria, with the specifics
  delegated to a regulatory text.
- As of the last research update, the **draft implementing decree** had been
  transmitted within government (reported as sent to the Secrétariat Général du
  Gouvernement) but was **not yet published**. **Until publication, no mandatory
  e-invoicing obligation is legally effective.** *(verify current status against
  the Bulletin Officiel and tax.gov.ma before advising.)*

### Expected model — Continuous Transaction Control (CTC / pre-clearance)

- Commentary points to a **clearance / CTC** model: each invoice would be
  **validated by the DGI platform before it is legally valid**, rather than a
  post-audit model where invoices are exchanged freely and checked later.
- The DGI was reported to have considered **both** post-audit and CTC; CTC /
  pre-clearance is the most-cited expectation but is **not formally confirmed** in
  a published text. *(verify.)*

### Expected platform

- A **national DGI platform**, developed by Moroccan firm **xHub** (Casablanca
  Technopark), integrated with the existing **Simpl-TVA** environment.
- A confirmed public-facing brand/URL (some sources speculate names such as
  *fatourati.gov.ma*) is **NOT verified**. Do not state a platform URL as fact.

### Expected formats

- Structured formats aligned to international standards — **UBL** (e.g. UBL 2.1)
  and/or **CII** — for interoperability. *(verify exact format and version in the
  technical spec / decree.)*

### Expected sequencing (waves)

- A **phased rollout** by size/type is expected: **large companies (B2B) first**,
  then **SMEs**, then **small enterprises**, then **B2C** last. **Specific dates
  and the turnover/headcount thresholds for each wave are decree-defined and not
  yet public** — do not quote figures.

### What this means for a freelancer

A typical self-employed person or micro-business sits in the **later waves** (small
enterprise / B2C), so even on the most aggressive announced timeline they are
**unlikely to be in the first cohort**. The honest position: *the obligation is
coming, the exact date for your tier is unknown, prepare but do not panic.*

---

## 4. Penalties

Two layers: **invoice-conformity penalties that exist today**, and **future
e-invoicing-specific penalties** that the decree may add.

### In force today (CGI)

- **Missing / wrong ICE** — penalty reported as **MAD 100 per omission**, capped
  around **MAD 5,000 per fiscal year** (CGI Art. 198 ter). *(verify amounts
  against current Loi de Finances.)*
- **Insufficient / irregular invoicing** — sanction reported in the range **MAD
  2,000 to MAD 50,000** (CGI Art. 146). *(verify.)*
- **Fictitious / fake invoices (factures fictives)** — **MAD 5,000 to 50,000** and
  potential criminal exposure (imprisonment) under CGI Art. 192. Serious; escalate.
- **Practical worst case: loss of deduction.** On audit the DGI routinely
  **rejects the customer's TVA and expense deduction** on a non-conforming invoice
  (no ICE/IF, broken numbering). This is usually costlier than the fixed fine.

### Future (e-invoicing-specific) — NOT yet set

- The implementing decree is expected to introduce **specific sanctions** for
  failure to issue cleared e-invoices, use of a non-compliant format, or
  non-transmission to the platform. **These do not exist as published, quantified
  penalties yet.** Do not state amounts. *(verify on decree publication.)*

> All penalty figures above are from secondary/research sources and require
> confirmation against the live CGI and the latest Loi de Finances by a Moroccan
> expert-comptable before being relied on.

## 5. What To Do Now

Practical, low-regret steps for a self-employed person — none of which depend on
the decree landing:

1. **Get and use your ICE.** Confirm your 15-digit **ICE** is obtained and printed
   on every invoice. Verify it (and your B2B clients' ICEs) where possible.
2. **Make invoices Art. 145-conforming today.** Seller IF/TP/RC/ICE, client ICE
   (B2B), **continuous sequential numbering with no gaps**, dates, descriptions,
   **HT / TVA-by-rate / TTC** breakdown. This is the baseline that survives any
   reform.
3. **Use structured invoicing software, not loose Word/Excel.** Pick a tool that
   keeps an unbroken numbering series and can export structured data. Vendors are
   already marketing "DGI 2026 ready / e-facture" software — treat such claims as
   **marketing, not certification**, until the DGI publishes conformity criteria.
4. **Keep your SIMPL access live.** Télédéclaration/télépaiement via **SIMPL**
   (portail.tax.gov.ma) is already mandatory for enterprises. Ensure credentials,
   email, and bank mandate work — the e-invoicing platform is expected to sit
   alongside this environment.
5. **Watch the Bulletin Officiel and tax.gov.ma** for the **décret d'application**
   and the **DGI technical specification**. The decree is the trigger event;
   nothing is mandatory before it.
6. **Identify your likely wave.** Large B2B is first; a freelancer is almost
   certainly later. Don't onboard to a clearance platform prematurely.
7. **Escalate the go-live decision** to a Moroccan **expert-comptable** once the
   decree is published — format choice, provider selection, and workflow change
   are professional-review items.

## 6. Reference + Test Suite

### Reference

- **CGI Art. 145** — mandatory invoice mentions (incl. Art. 145-VIII ICE).
- **CGI Art. 145-IX** — e-invoicing enabling provision (decree pending).
- **CGI Art. 146 / Art. 106** — regular-invoice precondition for deduction.
- **CGI Art. 192, 198 ter** — invoice-related sanctions.
- **Décret d'application (CGI 145-IX)** — *PENDING publication in the Bulletin
  Officiel; verify.*
- **PLF / Loi de Finances 2025–2026** — roadmap context; verify final wording.
- **SIMPL** — DGI télédéclaration/télépaiement portal (portail.tax.gov.ma).
- DGI: tax.gov.ma. Cross-skills: `morocco-vat`, `ma-auto-entrepreneur`,
  `ma-bookkeeping`, `ma-income-tax`.

### Test suite

**T1 — "When is e-invoicing mandatory for me?"** → State it is an announced
roadmap, decree pending, dates UNCONFIRMED; freelancers are in later waves; do not
quote a date. PASS only if no date asserted as fact.

**T2 — "Is fatourati.gov.ma the official platform?"** → Platform is a DGI/xHub
build integrated with Simpl-TVA; the public brand/URL is **not confirmed**. Do not
assert the name.

**T3 — "What must be on my invoice today?"** → ICE (seller, + client if B2B), IF,
TP/RC, sequential number, date, description, HT, TVA per rate, TTC, payment terms.

**T4 — "I forgot my client's ICE on a B2B invoice."** → Non-conforming; risks
client's TVA/expense deduction on audit + ICE-omission penalty (~MAD 100/omission,
verify). Reissue correctly.

**T5 — "Which format — UBL or CII?"** → Announced UBL/CII; exact format/version
**verify** in the DGI technical spec; not yet binding.

**T6 — Auto-entrepreneur asks if e-invoicing applies.** → Same roadmap; AE still
must issue Art. 145-conforming invoices with ICE now; later wave for clearance.
Cross-ref `ma-auto-entrepreneur`.

**T7 — "What's the penalty for a fake invoice?"** → CGI Art. 192: MAD 5,000–50,000
plus possible imprisonment; serious; escalate. Verify amounts.

**T8 — Vendor says software is "DGI 2026 certified."** → No published conformity
criteria yet; treat as marketing; verify after decree.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **NEVER assert an unconfirmed go-live date as fact.** The décret d'application is
  pending; all dates are provisional until published in the Bulletin Officiel.
- **NEVER state the clearance model (CTC/pre-clearance) as legally settled** — it
  is the expected model, not confirmed in a published text.
- **NEVER assert a platform name/URL** (e.g. *fatourati.gov.ma*) as official — not
  confirmed.
- **NEVER quote wave thresholds** (turnover/headcount) — decree-defined, not public.
- **NEVER state e-invoicing-specific penalty amounts** — not yet published.
- **NEVER accept an invoice without IF/ICE** as conforming.
- **NEVER tell a freelancer to onboard to a clearance platform before the decree** —
  that is a reviewer decision.
- **NEVER compute amounts** — defer arithmetic to the engine; this skill states
  rules and status only.

## Disclaimer

This skill is **research-verified** from DGI communications, the Loi de Finances /
PLF 2025–2026 process, and Big-4 / vendor commentary, and is **pending sign-off by
a qualified Moroccan expert-comptable**. Morocco's mandatory e-invoicing regime is
an **announced roadmap**: the implementing decree was still pending at the last
research update, so dates, scope, formats, the platform, and e-invoicing-specific
penalties are **subject to change and must be verified** against the Bulletin
Officiel and tax.gov.ma before being relied on.
