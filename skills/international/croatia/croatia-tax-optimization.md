# Croatia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: Porezna uprava (Tax Administration), PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, KPMG Croatia, and the 1 Jan 2025 tax-law amendments. Figures must agree with `croatia-income-tax.md` / `croatia-social-contributions.md`. NOT yet signed off by a licensed Croatian tax adviser. Every suggestion must be reviewed by a credentialed professional; aggressive positions are never advised.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Croatia (Republika Hrvatska) |
| Currency | EUR (since 1 Jan 2023) |
| Key optimisation levers | Regime choice (paušalni obrt / standard obrt / d.o.o.); personal allowance + dependants; returnee & youth reliefs; capital-allowance timing |
| PIT rates (2025) | Lower 20% (local range 15–23%) up to €60,000/yr; higher 30% (local range 25–33%) above. Local rate set by municipality. (Porezna uprava; PwC) |
| Corporate tax (d.o.o.) | 10% on revenue ≤ €1m; 18% above. Dividend withholding 12%. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current CIT bands and dividend rate.]** |
| VAT registration threshold (2025) | €60,000 (raised from €40,000) |
| Anti-avoidance | General anti-abuse rule in the General Tax Act (Opći porezni zakon); substance over form. No aggressive schemes. |

> **The single biggest Croatian lever is REGIME CHOICE.** For income up to €60,000/yr a paušalni (lump-sum) obrt usually pays far less than a standard obrt or a d.o.o. — confirm eligibility before anything else.

## Section 2 -- Regime Election (the core decision)

| Regime | Best when | Tax treatment | Trade-offs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Paušalni obrt** (lump-sum sole proprietor) | Annual income ≤ €60,000; low expenses; service freelancers | Income tax on a **deemed/flat base** by income bracket (paušalni dohodak), paid quarterly; flat lump-sum contributions; minimal bookkeeping (only KPR ledger); **not in VAT** | Cannot deduct real expenses; capped at €60,000; some activities excluded |
| **Standard obrt** (sole proprietor, real books) | Income > €60,000, or high real expenses, or VAT-registered customers | 20%/30% PIT on actual net profit after real deductions; full bookkeeping | Higher admin; pension/health on profit |
| **d.o.o.** (limited company) | Consistently high profit retained/reinvested, or liability/credibility needs | 10%/18% CIT, then 12% dividend tax on distribution; director can take salary | Audit/compliance cost; double layer if all distributed |

**Paušalni mechanics.** You are taxed on a deemed profit set by your income band (not your real profit), so when real margins are high the effective rate is very low. The exact paušalni base brackets up to €60,000 are set by ordinance. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current paušalni base table and the list of excluded activities.]**

**Tipping points to flag for the reviewer:**
- Approaching €60,000 → decide before year-end whether to stay paušalni (defer non-urgent invoicing to January) or move to standard/d.o.o.
- Real expenses > the deemed paušalni margin → standard obrt may beat paušalni.
- Profit consistently > ~€60,000 and largely reinvested → model a d.o.o. (CIT 10% retained vs 30% PIT). **AUDIT FLASH POINT** — incorporation purely for tax without commercial substance can be challenged under the general anti-abuse rule.

## Section 3 -- Income Splitting & Structuring

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Employ a spouse/family member | Genuine, documented, market-rate work → salary is a deductible business expense (standard obrt) and taxed in their hands, often at a lower marginal/local rate. |
| Dependants on the tax card | Each dependent child/relative increases the monthly personal allowance (see Section 5) — ensure the Porezna kartica (PK) is filed. |
| Municipality of residence | Local PIT rates vary (lower band 15–23%, higher 25–33%). Residence in a lower-rate JLS legitimately reduces tax. |
| d.o.o. salary vs dividend mix | For a company, balance a (deductible, contribution-bearing) director salary against 12% dividends. Model both. |

---

## Section 4 -- Deductions Most People Miss (standard obrt)

*(Paušalni obrt cannot deduct real expenses — this section is for standard obrt / d.o.o.)*

| Deduction | Note |
|---|---|
| Home office proportion | Business-use share of rent, utilities, internet — documented. |
| Professional subscriptions & chambers | HGK and professional bodies. |
| Training / CPD | Courses and conferences related to the current activity. |
| Software / SaaS | Recurring business subscriptions. |
| Bank & payment-processor fees | Business account, Stripe/PayPal fees. |
| Professional indemnity insurance | Business insurance. |
| Pillar II pension (5%) | Part of the mandatory 20% — ensure correctly applied. |

---

## Section 5 -- Reliefs & Credits

| Relief | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Basic personal allowance** | €600/month (€7,200/yr), 2025 (per `croatia-income-tax.md`). |
| **Dependants** | Child coefficients 0.5 / 0.7 / 1.0 × €600 (1st/2nd/3rd child) → €300 / €420 / €600 extra monthly allowance; dependent relatives also qualify (file the PK). |
| **Youth relief** | Employment income: **100% PIT relief for under-25s**, **50% for ages 26–30** (subject to conditions). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current age bands and caps.]** |
| **Returnee relief (new 2025)** | Croatian citizens who spent **≥ 2 years abroad** get a **5-year 100% PIT relief on employment income** on return. (KPMG Croatia, Jan-2025 amendments) **AUDIT FLASH POINT** — confirm eligibility conditions and that it applies to the income type. |

---

## Section 6 -- Capital Allowances Optimization

- Buy needed capital assets **before 31 December** to start depreciation in the current year (standard obrt / d.o.o.).
- Standard straight-line rates apply; confirm asset-class rates against the corporate income tax rules. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current depreciation rates and any accelerated/doubling option.]**
- Low-value assets may be expensed immediately under the de-minimis threshold — confirm the current limit.

---

## Section 7 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **General anti-abuse rule** (Opći porezni zakon): arrangements without economic substance whose main purpose is a tax advantage can be disregarded.
- Incorporating a d.o.o. or fragmenting income across multiple obrti **purely** to stay under €60,000 / lower rates, without genuine commercial purpose, is challengeable. **AUDIT FLASH POINT**.
- Paušalni obrt used to disguise what is really employment (single client, employer-like control) → risk of reclassification. **AUDIT FLASH POINT**.
- Never claim the returnee/youth reliefs without confirming the statutory conditions.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER advise staying paušalni by hiding income or splitting one business across related obrti without substance.
- NEVER present incorporation as a tax play without the commercial-substance warning.
- NEVER apply the youth or returnee relief without confirming eligibility for the specific income type.
- NEVER contradict the rates/thresholds in `croatia-income-tax.md` / `croatia-social-contributions.md`.
- NEVER present any figure marked [RESEARCH GAP] as confirmed.
- NEVER present optimisation suggestions as definitive advice — always route to a licensed Croatian tax adviser.
