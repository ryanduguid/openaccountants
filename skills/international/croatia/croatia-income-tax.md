### Tax Rate Brackets (2025)

Croatia splits income into **annual income** (employment, self-employment, other) taxed progressively and reconciled annually, and **final income** (capital, property, certain other) taxed at flat rates and **not aggregated** (PwC, Income determination). Local surtax (*prirez*) was **abolished from 1 January 2024** and folded into the income-tax rate ranges below (PwC, Significant developments).

**Default progressive rates (annual income)** -- apply where the local self-government unit (*jedinica lokalne samouprave*) has not set its own rates by 30 November (PwC; porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/income-tax/7363):

| Annual taxable income (EUR) | Monthly equivalent (EUR) | Default rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 60,000.00 | 0 -- 5,000.00 | 20% | EUR 12,000.00 |
| 60,000.01+ | 5,000.01+ | 30% | -- |

(Source: porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/income-tax/7363; PwC, Taxes on personal income.)

**Local-unit statutory rate ranges** -- a local unit may set the lower and higher rate anywhere inside these bands; the maximum band belongs to the City of Zagreb (PwC, Taxes on personal income):

| Unit type | Lower rate range | Higher rate range |
|---|---|---|
| Municipality (općina) | 15% -- 20% | 25% -- 30% |
| Town (grad) | 15% -- 21% | 25% -- 31% |
| City / county seat | 15% -- 22% | 25% -- 32% |
| City of Zagreb | 15% -- 23% | 25% -- 33% |

**Final / flat income (not aggregated into the annual assessment)** (PwC, Income determination):

| Category | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Capital income -- interest, dividends, capital gains | 12% | Final tax |
| Rental / lease of immovable & movable property | 12% | After a 30% lump-sum expense deduction |
| Grant of own shares / stock options (capital) | 24% | |
| Property rights; disposal of property and rights | 24% | |
| Withdrawal of assets / use of services (hidden distributions) | 36% | |
| Seasonal agricultural work (other income) | 10% | |
| Undeclared assets difference | 36% | Plus 100% penalty surcharge |

**Note (2026):** The 2026 contribution base caps have been increased (see Section 5.4). The 2025 progressive threshold (EUR 60,000) and personal allowance (EUR 600/month) pages appear stable into 2026 (PwC). Use 2025 figures for a 2025 computation.

### Personal Allowance and Dependant Coefficients (2025)

The basic monthly personal allowance (*osobni odbitak*) is **EUR 600.00/month = EUR 7,200.00/year**, coefficient 1.0, raised from EUR 560 in 2024 (porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/personal-allowance/7358). Dependant coefficients are **additive** to the EUR 600 base:

| Dependant | Coefficient | Monthly allowance (EUR) | Annual allowance (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Basic (taxpayer) | 1.0 | 600.00 | 7,200.00 |
| 1st child | 0.5 | 300.00 | 3,600.00 |
| 2nd child | 0.7 | 420.00 | 5,040.00 |
| 3rd child | 1.0 | 600.00 | 7,200.00 |
| Dependent immediate family member | 0.5 | 300.00 | 3,600.00 |

(Source: porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/personal-allowance/7358; PwC, Deductions. The coefficient ladder rises progressively for the 4th and subsequent children -- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the exact coefficients for the 4th child onward and the disability coefficients (partial 0.3 / full 1.0 require verification against the official allowance table).)

A person qualifies as a dependant only if their own annual income does **not exceed EUR 3,360.00** (PwC, Deductions).

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown local self-government unit (municipality) | Use default rates 20% / 30% -- do NOT guess a local rate |
| Unknown whether income is "annual" or "final" | Treat as annual (progressive) -- never silently apply a flat rate |
| Contribution base caps | Use 2025 figures: monthly EUR 10,788.00, annual first-pillar EUR 129,456.00 (NOT the 2026 EUR 11,958 figure) |
| Unknown dependants | Apply only the basic EUR 600/month allowance |
| Unknown salary-relief band | Compute the low-salary pension relief explicitly from the gross figure |
| Health contribution | Always an employer on-cost (16.5%), never deducted from employee net |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown sole-trader regime | Determining-income obrt (full books), NOT paušalni |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- for an employee: gross monthly salary (*bruto plaća*), number/type of dependants, and the local self-government unit (municipality) OR explicit instruction to use default rates. For a sole trader: bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text), the obrt regime (determining-income vs paušalni), and dependant details.

**Recommended** -- prior-year annual return or assessment, all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, JOPPD records, confirmation of pension pillar membership (most under-40s are in both pillar I + II), VAT registration status (relevant at the EUR 60,000 turnover threshold).

**Ideal** -- complete income & expenditure ledger (*knjiga primitaka i izdataka*), asset register, contribution-payment confirmations, confirmation of local-unit rate decision, age (for any youth PIT relief).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** For a sole trader, no bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that contributions, allowances, and the correct local-unit rate have been applied."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-HR-1 -- Local-unit rate genuinely required.** "Croatian PIT rates vary by municipality within statutory ranges (15-23% / 25-33%). Where the exact local rate materially changes the answer and the municipality is unknown, this skill defaults to 20% / 30% and flags the assumption. Confirm the taxpayer's *jedinica lokalne samouprave* for a precise figure."

**R-HR-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and sole traders (*obrt*) only. *d.o.o.* / *j.d.o.o.* companies pay corporate profit tax (*porez na dobit*) and file separate returns. Escalate to a Croatian tax adviser."

**R-HR-3 -- Non-resident / dual-resident income.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation and treaty relief have different rules. Out of scope. Escalate to a Croatian tax adviser."

**R-HR-4 -- Final-income / capital-gains complexity.** "Capital gains, dividend, and property-disposal computations are final-taxed at flat rates (12% / 24% / 36%) and are not aggregated. Confirm the precise category before applying a rate; complex disposals should be escalated."

**R-HR-5 -- Undeclared assets / enforcement.** "Undeclared-asset differences are taxed at 36% with a 100% penalty surcharge, plus default interest. Do not advise. Escalate to a Croatian tax adviser immediately."

**R-HR-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Croatian VAT (PDV), use the croatia-vat-return skill. For detailed payroll mechanics, see croatia-payroll; for contributions, croatia-social-contributions."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All examples use 2025 figures and the **default 20% / 30%** progressive rates (no local-unit decision known). Contributions use 2025 caps (NN 137/2024). Currency is EUR.

### Example 1 -- Standard employee net pay (gross > EUR 1,300)

**Input line:**
`31/01/2025 ; ZABA UPLATA ; POSLODAVAC d.o.o. ; PLAĆA SIJEČANJ ; +1,400.00 ; EUR`

**Scenario:** Employee, gross monthly salary EUR 2,000.00, single, no dependants.

**Reasoning:**
1. Gross > EUR 1,300 → no low-salary relief; pension base = full gross EUR 2,000.00.
2. Pension contribution 20% (15% pillar I + 5% pillar II) = EUR 2,000.00 × 20% = **EUR 400.00** (withheld). (PwC, Other taxes.)
3. Income after pension = EUR 2,000.00 - EUR 400.00 = EUR 1,600.00.
4. Personal allowance = EUR 600.00 (osobni odbitak). PIT base = EUR 1,600.00 - EUR 600.00 = EUR 1,000.00.
5. PIT base EUR 1,000.00 < EUR 5,000.00 monthly threshold → 20%. PIT = EUR 1,000.00 × 20% = **EUR 200.00**.
6. Net pay = EUR 1,600.00 - EUR 200.00 = **EUR 1,400.00**.
7. Employer health contribution = EUR 2,000.00 × 16.5% = **EUR 330.00** (on top of gross, not from net). Total employer cost = EUR 2,330.00.

**Classification:** Net EUR 1,400.00; employee pension EUR 400.00; PIT EUR 200.00; employer health EUR 330.00.

### Example 2 -- Low-salary relief band (EUR 700.01 -- EUR 1,300.00)

**Scenario:** Employee, gross monthly salary EUR 1,000.00, single, no dependants.

**Reasoning:**
1. Gross EUR 1,000.00 is in the EUR 700.01--1,300.00 band → relief base = gross - 0.5 × (1,300.00 - gross) = 1,000.00 - 0.5 × 300.00 = **EUR 850.00**. (PwC, Other taxes.)
2. Pension 20% × EUR 850.00 = **EUR 170.00** (withheld).
3. Income after pension = EUR 1,000.00 - EUR 170.00 = EUR 830.00.
4. PIT base = EUR 830.00 - EUR 600.00 allowance = EUR 230.00.
5. PIT = EUR 230.00 × 20% = **EUR 46.00**.
6. Net pay = EUR 830.00 - EUR 46.00 = **EUR 784.00**.
7. Employer health = EUR 1,000.00 × 16.5% = **EUR 165.00**.

**Classification:** Net EUR 784.00; pension EUR 170.00 (on reduced base EUR 850.00); PIT EUR 46.00; employer health EUR 165.00.

### Example 3 -- Final income: dividend (not aggregated)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; PBZ DOZNAKA ; XYZ d.o.o. ; DIVIDENDA 2024 ; +5,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Dividend is **capital income**, taxed as **final income at 12%** and NOT aggregated into the annual progressive assessment (PwC, Income determination). PIT = EUR 5,000.00 × 12% = **EUR 600.00** (typically withheld at source by the payer).

**Classification:** Final income; tax EUR 600.00; do NOT add to annual progressive base.

### Example 4 -- Final income: residential rental

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; ERSTE UPLATA ; TENANT NAME ; NAJAMNINA OŽUJAK ; +800.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Rental of immovable property is **final income at 12% after a 30% lump-sum expense deduction** (PwC, Income determination). Taxable base = EUR 800.00 × (1 - 0.30) = EUR 560.00. PIT = EUR 560.00 × 12% = **EUR 67.20** per month.

**Classification:** Final income; monthly tax EUR 67.20; not aggregated.

### Example 5 -- Sole trader (obrt, determining income) annual PIT

**Scenario:** Determining-income sole trader, **net business income after deductible contributions = EUR 40,000.00**, one child (1st child coefficient 0.5).

**Reasoning:**
1. Annual personal allowance = basic EUR 7,200.00 + 1st child EUR 3,600.00 = **EUR 10,800.00**.
2. Taxable income = EUR 40,000.00 - EUR 10,800.00 = **EUR 29,200.00**.
3. EUR 29,200.00 < EUR 60,000.00 threshold → 20%. PIT = EUR 29,200.00 × 20% = **EUR 5,840.00**. (porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/income-tax/7363.)

**Classification:** Annual progressive income; PIT EUR 5,840.00. File the annual return by end of February of the following year.

### Example 6 -- High earner crossing the EUR 60,000 threshold

**Scenario:** Determining-income sole trader, **taxable income (after allowance) = EUR 80,000.00**, default rates.

**Reasoning:**
1. First EUR 60,000.00 × 20% = **EUR 12,000.00**.
2. Excess EUR 20,000.00 × 30% = **EUR 6,000.00**.
3. Total PIT = EUR 12,000.00 + EUR 6,000.00 = **EUR 18,000.00**. (porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/income-tax/7363.)

**Classification:** Annual progressive income; PIT EUR 18,000.00.

### Example 7 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`20/04/2025 ; ZABA INTERNI PRIJENOS ; VLASTITI RAČUN ŠTEDNJA ; ; -3,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:** Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residence and Scope

**Legislation:** Zakon o porezu na dohodak.

Tax year is the calendar year. **Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Croatian-source income** (PwC, Tax administration). Income splits into **annual income** (employment, self-employment, other) taxed progressively and reconciled annually, and **final income** (capital, property, certain other) taxed at flat rates and not aggregated.

### 5.2 Progressive Rates and Local Units

**Legislation:** Zakon o porezu na dohodak; PwC.

Default rates for 2025 are **20%** on annual income up to **EUR 60,000.00** (EUR 5,000.00/month) and **30%** on the excess (porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/income-tax/7363). Local self-government units may set the lower rate within **15%--23%** and the higher rate within **25%--33%** (max ranges: City of Zagreb); the default applies where no decision is made by 30 November (PwC). Local surtax (*prirez*) was abolished from 1 January 2024 and absorbed into the wider PIT rate ranges (PwC, Significant developments).

### 5.3 Personal Allowance and Dependants

The basic monthly personal allowance is **EUR 600.00** (EUR 7,200.00/year), coefficient 1.0 (porezna-uprava.gov.hr/en/personal-allowance/7358). Dependant coefficients are additive: 1st child 0.5 (EUR 300/month), 2nd child 0.7 (EUR 420), 3rd child 1.0 (EUR 600), and a dependent immediate family member 0.5 (EUR 300). A person qualifies as a dependant only if own annual income does not exceed **EUR 3,360.00** (PwC, Deductions). **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** 4th-and-later child coefficients and disability coefficients.

### 5.4 Employee Contributions (Pension)

**Legislation:** Zakon o doprinosima; NN 137/2024.

Employee pension contributions total **20% of gross salary**: **15% first pillar** (*mirovinsko I. stup*) + **5% second pillar** (*mirovinsko II. stup*) (PwC, Other taxes). 2025 base caps: highest **monthly base EUR 10,788.00**; highest **annual first-pillar base EUR 129,456.00** (average gross salary EUR 1,798.00 × coefficient 6.00; NN 137/2024).

| Contribution | Who pays | Rate | 2025 base cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pension pillar I | Employee (withheld) | 15% | Monthly EUR 10,788.00 / annual EUR 129,456.00 |
| Pension pillar II | Employee (withheld) | 5% | Monthly EUR 10,788.00 |
| **Pension total (employee)** | **Employee** | **20%** | **Monthly EUR 10,788.00** |
| Health (zdravstveno) | **Employer** (on top) | 16.5% | Uncapped |

(Sources: NN 137/2024; PwC, Other taxes.)

Component check: pillar I 15% + pillar II 5% = **20%** total employee pension; this is the only employee statutory deduction. Employer pays health 16.5% separately, so the employer column total on-cost is **16.5%**.

**2026 update:** NN 150/2025 raises the 2026 monthly base cap to **EUR 11,958.00** and the annual first-pillar cap to **EUR 143,496.00**. Use 2025 figures for a 2025 computation (research caveat).

### 5.5 Low-Salary Pension Relief (2025)

**Legislation:** Zakon o doprinosima; PwC, Other taxes.

The pension contribution base is reduced for low earners:

| Monthly gross | Pension base |
|---|---|
| Up to EUR 700.00 | gross - EUR 300.00 |
| EUR 700.01 -- 1,300.00 | gross - 0.5 × (1,300.00 - gross) |
| Above EUR 1,300.00 | full gross |

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a local-unit rate without confirming the municipality -- default to 20%/30% with an explicit flag
- NEVER aggregate final income (capital, dividends, rent) into the annual progressive base
- NEVER compute the final PIT figure as definitive -- always label it estimated and pass the base to the deterministic engine
- NEVER deduct the employer health contribution (16.5%) from the employee's net pay -- it is an employer on-cost
- NEVER use the full gross as the pension base when gross <= EUR 1,300 -- apply the low-salary relief formula
- NEVER use 2026 contribution caps for a 2025 computation (use EUR 10,788/month, EUR 129,456/year per NN 137/2024)
- NEVER treat a dependant as qualifying if their own annual income exceeds EUR 3,360.00
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, or income tax itself as a deduction
- NEVER invent the paušalni receipt brackets, depreciation rates, or youth-relief mechanics -- these are RESEARCH GAPS for the reviewer
- NEVER apply pillar II (5%) without confirming second-pillar membership
