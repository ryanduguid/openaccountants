description: >
  Use this skill whenever asked about reducing tax in Slovenia, tax planning, or legal strategies to minimise tax for a self-employed person (s.p.) or small company in Slovenia. Trigger on phrases like "reduce tax Slovenia", "normiranec", "normirani s.p.", "lump-sum tax Slovenia", "80% expense deduction", "flat-rate sole proprietor Slovenia", "s.p. vs d.o.o.", "save tax Slovenia", "tax planning Slovenia". This skill covers the normiranec (standardised-expense) flat-rate regime giving tax on ~20% of revenue, the revenue thresholds and mandatory-exit rules, regular s.p. vs d.o.o., the 2026 changes, and the disguised-employment red line. ALWAYS read this skill before advising on any Slovenian tax optimisation.

# Slovenia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Republic of Slovenia |
| Currency | EUR |
| Headline lever | **Normiranec** (standardised-expense) s.p. — 80% deemed expenses, so you're taxed on only ~20% of revenue |
| Corporate tax (d.o.o.) | **19%** |
| Anti-avoidance | Substance; mandatory exit thresholds; disguised employment (single-client "s.p.") |

> **The Slovenian headline is the NORMIRANEC regime:** a sole proprietor is granted **80% standardised expenses** (no receipts needed), so tax + contributions fall on only **~20% of revenue** — a very low effective rate for low-cost service freelancers.

---

## Section 2 -- Normiranec (standardised-expense) Regime

| Feature | Full-time s.p. | Part-time s.p. |
|---|---|---|
| Standardised expenses | 80% of revenue up to €60,000 | 80% up to €12,500, then 40% up to €30,000 |
| Stay-in revenue ceiling | up to **€120,000** (2-yr average) | up to **€50,000** |
| Tax base | the non-deemed portion of revenue (≈20%) | as above |

You pay tax/contributions on the small deemed-profit base instead of real profit — ideal when real expenses are well below 80%. **No bookkeeping of actual costs.** (Sibiz; Data)

**2026 change:** normiranci move to a **progressive scale**; revenue above €120,000 is taxed at **35%**. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2026 progressive brackets and whether the flat treatment is fully replaced.]**

## Section 3 -- Regime Choice

| Route | Best when |
|---|---|
| **Normiranec s.p.** | Low real expenses, revenue within the ceilings, want simplicity → tax on ~20% of revenue |
| **Regular s.p.** (real expenses) | Real expenses **> 80%** of revenue, or above the normiranec ceiling |
| **d.o.o.** (company, 19% CIT) | Higher profit retained/reinvested; liability/credibility; want to control salary/dividend extraction |

**Tipping points:** crossing the €60,000 (80% cap) or €120,000 (stay-in) thresholds; real expenses exceeding the 80% deemed level; consistent high retained profit → model a d.o.o.

---

## Section 4 -- d.o.o. Extraction

- 19% CIT on profit; retained profit deferred until distribution.
- Owner balances a (deductible, contribution-bearing) salary against dividends. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current dividend tax rate and any owner-salary minimums.]**

---

## Section 5 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Mandatory exit:** when the 2-year average revenue exceeds the threshold (€50,000 part-time / €120,000 full-time), you must leave the normiranec regime — don't under-report to stay in.
- **Disguised employment:** a single-client "s.p." under employer-like control can be reclassified. **AUDIT FLASH POINT**.
- **Fragmentation:** splitting one business across related s.p./d.o.o. to stay under thresholds, without substance, is challengeable.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER combine the 80% standardised expenses with real-expense deductions — it is one or the other.
- NEVER advise under-reporting revenue to remain a normiranec.
- NEVER present a single-client s.p. as genuine self-employment.
- NEVER contradict the rates in `slovenia-income-tax.md` / `slovenia-social-contributions.md`.
- NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Slovenian tax adviser.
