> **Tier 2 — research-verified, NOT yet accountant-verified.** Several figures rely on Big-4 (PwC/KPMG) and aggregator summaries rather than FURS primary documents. Items marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** require a licensed Slovenian accountant (davčni svetovalec / pooblaščeni računovodja) to confirm against FURS/ZPIZ/ZZZS primary sources before reliance. Research confidence: **medium**.

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Akontacija Dohodnine)

The employer withholds personal income tax (dohodnina) monthly at source as an advance (akontacija) on employment income, applying the monthly portion of the general allowance (splošna olajšava) and any registered personal reliefs. The advance is computed on the FURS monthly schedule and reconciled annually by FURS [FURS — dohodnina, dohodek iz zaposlitve].

### Progressive PIT Rate Table (2025)

Brackets apply to the **annual taxable base** (annual employment income after social contributions and allowances). Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries / FURS dohodninska lestvica 2025.

| Bracket | Taxable Base (EUR) | Marginal Rate | Cumulative Tax at Lower Bound (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 -- 9,210.26 | 16% | 0 |
| 2 | 9,210.26 -- 27,089 | 26% | 1,473.64 |
| 3 | 27,089 -- 54,178 | 33% | 6,122.11 |
| 4 | 54,178 -- 78,016.32 | 39% | 15,061.48 |
| 5 | over 78,016.32 | 50% | 24,358.43 |

**Cumulative-tax self-check (recomputed):**
- B1 top: 9,210.26 x 16% = 1,473.64 ✓
- B2 top: 1,473.64 + (27,089 − 9,210.26) x 26% = 1,473.64 + 4,648.47 = 6,122.11 ✓
- B3 top: 6,122.11 + (54,178 − 27,089) x 33% = 6,122.11 + 8,939.37 = 15,061.48 ✓
- B4 top: 15,061.48 + (78,016.32 − 54,178) x 39% = 15,061.48 + 9,296.94 = 24,358.42 (≈ 24,358.43, rounding) ✓

| Bracket | Taxable Base (EUR) | Marginal Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 -- 9,721.43 | 16% |
| 2 | 9,721.43 -- 28,592.44 | 26% |

| 5 | over 82,346.23 | 50% |

### General Allowance (Splošna Olajšava)

| Item | Value (EUR) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Base general allowance (annual) | 5,000 | PwC Slovenia Deductions |
| Additional low-earner linear allowance | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** — for low earners an additional linear allowance applies; the 2025 threshold/formula reported around income up to EUR 16,832 with formula `19,736.99 − 1.17259 x annual income` is **unverified against the FURS primary document** | WebSearch (FURS olajšave 2025) — NOT verified |

> Do **not** assume a higher EUR 5,260 base figure; it was not confirmed and is likely a different year. Use EUR 5,000 base unless a reviewer confirms otherwise against FURS.

### Withholding Method

For monthly withholding the employer applies the FURS monthly schedule: take the monthly gross, deduct employee social contributions, deduct 1/12 of the applicable annual general allowance (and any registered reliefs), and apply the progressive scale (annualised or via the FURS monthly table) [FURS]. The 0% band does **not** exist in Slovenia — the lowest bracket is 16%; the tax-free effect comes from the general allowance, not a zero-rate band. FURS issues an annual informative income-tax calculation (informativni izračun dohodnine) reconciling withheld advances against final liability [FURS].

### Out of Scope (schedular income)

Capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains, rental) is taxed schedularly at a flat **25%** (capital gains rate reduces with holding period), **outside** the progressive wage scale [PwC]. Do not run capital income through the payroll progressive brackets.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions

Employee social security contributions are deducted from gross employment income (bruto plača). Employee contributions on employment income are **uncapped** (no ceiling); the 3.5x-average-wage maximum base applies to self-employed only (see Section 5 / Section 11) [KPMG Flash Alert 2025-133; ZPIZ-2].

| Contribution | Administrator | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pension and disability insurance | ZPIZ | 15.50% | gross employment income |
| Compulsory health insurance | ZZZS | 6.36% | gross employment income |
| Unemployment insurance | — | 0.14% | gross employment income |

| **TOTAL (from 1 Jul 2025, incl. LTC)** | | **23.10%** | applies to payrolls from 1 Jul 2025 |

**Employee total self-check (recomputed):** 15.50 + 6.36 + 0.14 + 0.10 = 22.10 ✓; + 1.00 LTC = 23.10 ✓

> **Date split is mandatory.** Payrolls dated before 1 July 2025 use 22.10%; payrolls dated on/after 1 July 2025 use 23.10% (the extra 1% is the LTC contribution) [KPMG Flash Alert 2025-133; ZDOsk-1].

### Separate Flat Compulsory Health Contribution (CHC / OZZ replacement)

A separate **flat per-capita** Compulsory Health Contribution is deducted from insured individuals (not a percentage of wage):

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the more cautious assumption and flag it. These are the project-standard defaults for Slovenia payroll [KPMG Flash Alert 2025-133; PwC].

| Assumption | Conservative default |
|---|---|
| Employee social contribution rate | Use **23.10%** for payrolls from 1 July 2025 onward (incl. 1% LTC); **22.10%** before that date [KPMG] |
| Employer social contribution rate | Use **17.10%** for payrolls from 1 July 2025 onward (incl. 1% LTC); **16.10%** before that date [KPMG] |
| Employee contribution ceiling | Treat employee contributions as **uncapped** on gross wage (no ceiling for employees); the 3.5x cap applies to self-employed only [KPMG; ZPIZ-2] |
| General allowance | Apply **EUR 5,000** base general allowance plus the low-earner additional allowance where the employee qualifies; do **not** assume EUR 5,260 [PwC] |
| Date split | If the pay date is unknown but the period spans 1 July 2025, **ask** rather than guess; the LTC 1%+1% only applies from that date |
| CHC flat contribution | Treat the EUR 37.17/month (from 1 Mar 2025) as a separate deduction line and flag remittance responsibility as unconfirmed |
| PIT brackets | Use 2025 brackets for 2025 pay dates; 2026 indexed brackets for 2026 pay dates |

---

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

Before computing any Slovenia payslip, you MUST have:

1. **Gross monthly salary (bruto plača)** in EUR
2. **Pay date** (determines 2025 vs 2026 brackets AND pre/post 1 July 2025 LTC rate)
3. **Tax residency** (resident vs non-resident — affects allowance entitlement)
4. **General allowance eligibility** (is the employee a low earner qualifying for the additional linear allowance?)
5. **Registered personal reliefs** (dependants, disability, etc., as registered with FURS)
6. **Whether the flat CHC is employer-deducted** for this employee

### Refusal Catalogue — refuse or flag, do not guess

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No pay date given | REFUSE to pick a contribution rate — ask whether the pay date is before or from 1 July 2025 |
| Pay date in 2026 but only 2025 brackets requested | Use 2026 indexed brackets; flag the switch |
| Employee claims a EUR 5,260 general allowance | Decline; use EUR 5,000 unless reviewer confirms |
| Request to cap employee contributions at EUR 8,876.11 | Decline — that cap is self-employed only; employee contributions are uncapped |
| Request to apply a 0% tax band | Decline — Slovenia's lowest band is 16%; the relief is the general allowance, not a 0% bracket |
| Capital/dividend/rental income mixed into the wage base | Separate it — that is schedular 25% income, not progressive wage income |
| Exact statutory penalty figure requested | State that fine bands are in ZDavP-2 / ZPSV and were not captured at figure level — flag as research gap |

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

> All examples assume a **resident, single** employee with only the **EUR 5,000 base** general allowance (no additional low-earner allowance modelled — see the research gap in Section 2), monthly pay, and the FURS schedule approximated by annualising the monthly taxable base. Figures are recomputed end-to-end and reconcile to the cent. They are **estimates** for illustration; a reviewer must confirm the exact FURS monthly-schedule treatment and the additional allowance.

Convention used in every example:
- `monthly general allowance = 5,000 / 12 = 416.67`
- `monthly PIT base = gross − employee SSC − 416.67`
- `annual PIT base = monthly PIT base x 12`, taxed on the bracket table, then `÷ 12` for the month
- CHC shown separately at EUR 37.17/month (from 1 Mar 2025) where applicable

### Example 1 — EUR 2,000 gross, pay date in/after July 2025 (LTC applies)

Bank line: `IZPLAČILO PLAČE — EUR 1,323.21` (before CHC)

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly | 2,000.00 |
| Employee SSC @ 23.10% | 462.00 |
| — pension 15.50% / health 6.36% / unemp 0.14% / parental 0.10% / LTC 1.00% | 310.00 / 127.20 / 2.80 / 2.00 / 20.00 |
| Less monthly general allowance | (416.67) |
| Monthly PIT base | 1,121.33 |
| Annual PIT base (x12) | 13,455.96 |
| Annual PIT (B2: 1,473.64 + (13,455.96 − 9,210.26) x 26%) | 2,577.52 |
| Monthly PIT (÷12) | 214.79 |
| **Net before CHC** (2,000 − 462.00 − 214.79) | **1,323.21** |
| Less flat CHC | (37.17) |
| **Net after CHC** | **1,286.04** |
| Employer SSC @ 17.10% | 342.00 |
| **Total employer cost** (2,000 + 342.00) | **2,342.00** |

### Example 2 — Minimum wage, EUR 1,277.72 gross, pay date from July 2025

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly | 1,277.72 |
| Employee SSC @ 23.10% | 295.15 |
| Less monthly general allowance | (416.67) |
| Monthly PIT base | 565.90 |
| Annual PIT base (x12) | 6,790.80 |
| Annual PIT (B1: 6,790.80 x 16%) | 1,086.53 |
| Monthly PIT (÷12) | 90.54 |
| **Net before CHC** | **892.03** |
| Less flat CHC | (37.17) |
| **Net after CHC** | **854.86** |
| Employer SSC @ 17.10% | 218.49 |
| **Total employer cost** | **1,496.21** |

### Example 3 — EUR 3,500 gross, pay date from July 2025 (crosses into 33% band annually)

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly | 3,500.00 |
| Employee SSC @ 23.10% | 808.50 |
| Less monthly general allowance | (416.67) |
| Monthly PIT base | 2,274.83 |
| Annual PIT base (x12) | 27,297.96 |
| Annual PIT (B3: 6,122.11 + (27,297.96 − 27,089) x 33%) | 6,191.07 |
| Monthly PIT (÷12) | 515.92 |
| **Net before CHC** | **2,175.58** |
| Less flat CHC | (37.17) |
| **Net after CHC** | **2,138.41** |
| Employer SSC @ 17.10% | 598.50 |

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly | 6,500.00 |
| Employee SSC @ 23.10% | 1,501.50 |
| Less monthly general allowance | (416.67) |
| Monthly PIT base | 4,581.83 |
| Annual PIT base (x12) | 54,981.96 |
| Annual PIT (B4: 15,061.48 + (54,981.96 − 54,178) x 39%) | 15,375.02 |
| Monthly PIT (÷12) | 1,281.25 |
| **Net before CHC** | **3,717.25** |
| Less flat CHC | (37.17) |
| **Net after CHC** | **3,680.08** |
| Employer SSC @ 17.10% | 1,111.50 |
| **Total employer cost** | **7,611.50** |

### Example 5 — EUR 2,000 gross, pay date Jan-Feb 2025 (PRE-LTC; date-split demonstration)

Demonstrates the mandatory date split: pre-1-July rates 22.10% / 16.10% and CHC EUR 35.00.

| Step | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly | 2,000.00 |
| Employee SSC @ 22.10% | 442.00 |
| Less monthly general allowance | (416.67) |
| Monthly PIT base | 1,141.33 |
| Annual PIT base (x12) | 13,695.96 |
| Annual PIT (B2: 1,473.64 + (13,695.96 − 9,210.26) x 26%) | 2,639.92 |
| Monthly PIT (÷12) | 219.99 |
| **Net before CHC** | **1,338.01** |
| Less flat CHC (Jan-Feb 2025) | (35.00) |
| **Net after CHC** | **1,303.01** |
| Employer SSC @ 16.10% | 322.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | **2,322.00** |

> Compare Examples 1 and 5: the same EUR 2,000 gross yields a different net and employer cost solely because of the 1 July 2025 LTC contribution. Always confirm the pay date.

## Section 10 -- Tier 1 Rules (Deterministic)

These rules are mechanical and should be applied without reviewer judgement.

1. Apply the **2025 PIT brackets** (Section 2) for 2025 pay dates; the **2026 indexed brackets** for 2026 pay dates [PwC; Orbitax].
2. Employee social contributions = **22.10%** before 1 Jul 2025, **23.10%** from 1 Jul 2025 (incl. 1% LTC) [PwC; KPMG].
3. Employer social contributions = **16.10%** before 1 Jul 2025, **17.10%** from 1 Jul 2025 (incl. 1% LTC) [PwC; KPMG].
4. Compute the **PIT base** as gross minus employee social contributions minus the monthly portion of the general allowance and registered reliefs [FURS].
5. Slovenia has **no 0% tax band** — the lowest marginal rate is 16%; relief comes from the general allowance [PwC].
6. Employee wage contributions are **uncapped** — never apply the EUR 8,876.11 (3.5x) cap to an employee [KPMG; ZPIZ-2].
7. Capital income (dividends/interest/gains/rental) is **flat 25%** schedular, never run through the progressive wage scale [PwC].
8. File **REK-O** electronically via eDavki **on the day of payment** of employment income; remit tax and contributions on/around the pay date [FURS].
9. Minimum gross monthly wage: **EUR 1,277.72 (2025)**, **EUR 1,481.88 (2026)** — never compute a regular full-time gross below this [WageIndicator; RRA Koroška].
10. The flat **CHC** is EUR 35.00/month (Jan-Feb 2025) then EUR 37.17/month (from 1 Mar 2025), a per-capita amount, not a percentage [PwC].

| M | Employer SSC rate | `=IF(B>=DATE(2025,7,1),0.171,0.161)` |
| N | Employer SSC | `=C*M` |
| O | Total employer cost | `=C+N` |

Add a validation cell asserting `D + M = combined wedge` and a check that the `E` component rows sum to `C*D`.

## Section 14 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you do not have enough information to compute a payslip, gather these in order and do not guess:

1. **Pay date** — before or from 1 July 2025? Which calendar year? (sets contribution rate + bracket table)
2. **Gross monthly salary (bruto plača)** in EUR
3. **Tax residency** and **general allowance eligibility** (incl. low-earner additional allowance)
4. **Registered personal reliefs** (dependants etc.)
5. **CHC handling** for this employee

If any of items 1-3 are missing, STOP and ask. Never default a contribution rate without a pay date (the 1 July 2025 LTC split makes this load-bearing).

> **Caveat (research confidence: medium).** The FURS 2025 bracket schedule is published as a binary .docx (Lestvica_za_leto_2025.docx) not parsed in this session; a reviewer should open that DOCX and the FURS splošna olajšava 2025 tool to confirm the exact 2025 thresholds (PwC-sourced here) and the general-allowance figure (EUR 5,000 base confirmed; EUR 5,260 NOT confirmed). The PwC "other taxes" table lists pre-LTC rates (22.10%/16.10%); the 1%+1% LTC contribution (KPMG 2025-133, ZDOsk-1) took effect 1 July 2025 — any payroll engine must apply a date split. CHC amounts and remittance, the employee "uncapped" treatment, self-employed base figures, the average-wage anchor, and penalty bands all require reviewer confirmation as flagged above.

## Section 16 -- Test Suite

Numbered self-checks an agent (or reviewer) can run against this skill. Expected values recomputed in this skill.

1. **Employee SSC components sum (pre-LTC):** 15.50 + 6.36 + 0.14 + 0.10 = **22.10%**. ✓
2. **Employee SSC with LTC (from 1 Jul 2025):** 22.10 + 1.00 = **23.10%**. ✓
3. **Employer SSC components sum (pre-LTC):** 8.85 + 6.56 + 0.53 + 0.06 + 0.10 = **16.10%**. ✓
4. **Employer SSC with LTC (from 1 Jul 2025):** 16.10 + 1.00 = **17.10%**. ✓
5. **Bracket 2 cumulative tax:** 9,210.26 x 16% = **1,473.64**. ✓
6. **Bracket 3 cumulative tax:** 1,473.64 + (27,089 − 9,210.26) x 26% = **6,122.11**. ✓
7. **Bracket 4 cumulative tax:** 6,122.11 + (54,178 − 27,089) x 33% = **15,061.48**. ✓
8. **Bracket 5 cumulative tax:** 15,061.48 + (78,016.32 − 54,178) x 39% = **24,358.42** (≈ 24,358.43 rounding). ✓
9. **Example 1 net before CHC (EUR 2,000, from Jul 2025):** 2,000 − 462.00 − 214.79 = **1,323.21**. ✓
10. **Example 1 total employer cost:** 2,000 + (2,000 x 17.10%) = 2,000 + 342.00 = **2,342.00**. ✓
11. **Example 2 minimum-wage net before CHC:** 1,277.72 − 295.15 − 90.54 = **892.03**. ✓
12. **Example 3 mid-earner monthly PIT:** annual base 27,297.96 → (6,122.11 + (27,297.96 − 27,089) x 33%)/12 = **515.92**. ✓
13. **Example 4 higher-earner monthly PIT:** annual base 54,981.96 → (15,061.48 + (54,981.96 − 54,178) x 39%)/12 = **1,281.25**. ✓
14. **Date-split check (Example 5):** same EUR 2,000 gross at 22.10%/16.10% gives net before CHC **1,338.01** and employer cost **2,322.00** — differs from Example 1, confirming the LTC split matters. ✓
15. **Ceiling sanity:** every bracket upper bound ≥ its lower bound; self-employed max base (8,876.11) ≥ min base (1,521.62). ✓
16. **No-0%-band check:** lowest marginal rate is 16%, not 0%. ✓

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER pick a contribution rate without knowing the pay date — the 1 July 2025 LTC split changes employee 22.10%→23.10% and employer 16.10%→17.10%
- NEVER apply a 0% tax band — Slovenia's lowest marginal rate is 16%; relief comes from the general allowance
- NEVER cap employee social contributions at EUR 8,876.11 — that 3.5x cap is self-employed only; employee wage contributions are uncapped
- NEVER assume a EUR 5,260 general allowance — use EUR 5,000 base unless a reviewer confirms otherwise against FURS
- NEVER run capital income (dividends/interest/gains/rental) through the progressive wage scale — it is flat 25% schedular
- NEVER compute a regular full-time gross below the minimum wage (EUR 1,277.72 in 2025, EUR 1,481.88 in 2026)
- NEVER omit the flat CHC deduction or assume its remittance responsibility — flag it as unconfirmed
- NEVER miss the REK-O obligation — it is filed via eDavki on the day of payment of employment income
- NEVER state a penalty figure as definitive — ZDavP-2 / ZPSV bands were not captured at figure level here
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label them as estimated and direct the user to a licensed Slovenian accountant
