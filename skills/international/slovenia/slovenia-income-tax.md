### Tax Rate Brackets -- Progressive Scale (dohodnina) 2025

Applies to the **annual tax base** (net annual income after allowances) for income that falls under the progressive scale (employment, self-employment/business, pension). Capital income is taxed separately (cedularly) -- see below.

| Annual Tax Base (EUR) | Rate | Tax on Lower Limit + Marginal | Cumulative Tax at Top |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 9,210.26 | 16% | 16% of base | EUR 1,473.64 |
| 9,210.26 -- 27,089.00 | 26% | 1,473.64 + 26% over 9,210.26 | EUR 6,122.11 |
| 27,089.00 -- 54,178.00 | 33% | 6,122.11 + 33% over 27,089.00 | EUR 15,061.48 |
| 54,178.00 -- 78,016.32 | 39% | 15,061.48 + 39% over 54,178.00 | EUR 24,358.43 |
| 78,016.32+ | 50% | 24,358.43 + 50% over 78,016.32 | -- |

Source: official 2025 scale, Zveza računovodij, finančnikov in revizorjev Slovenije (zvezarfr.si); cross-checked against PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (taxsummaries.pwc.com/slovenia/individual/taxes-on-personal-income).

**Arithmetic note:** the band-4 top cumulative recomputes to 24,358.42 (15,061.48 + (78,016.32 − 54,178.00) × 39%); the official table publishes 24,358.43. The 1-cent difference is a published rounding artifact -- use the official 24,358.43 as the band-5 base. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the exact published band-5 base against the FURS Uredba/lestvica for 2025.]

### Capital Income -- Cedular (Separate, Final) Rates 2025

| Income Type | Rate | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends | 25% flat, final | Separate from progressive scale (PwC income-determination) |
| Interest | 25% flat, final | Bank deposit interest exempt up to EUR 1,000/year (EU institutions) (PwC) |
| Rental income | 25% flat, final | Cedular schedular tax (PwC income-determination) |
| Capital gains -- held 0–5 yrs | 25% | Final tax by holding period (PwC) |
| Capital gains -- held 5–10 yrs | 20% | Final tax (PwC) |
| Capital gains -- held 10–15 yrs | 15% | Final tax (PwC) |
| Capital gains -- held over 15 yrs | 0% | Exempt (PwC) |

**Capital income is NOT added to the progressive base and is NOT taxed on the 16/26/33/39/50% scale.** A secondary source quoted 27.5% for dividends/interest; the authoritative PwC income-determination page confirms 25% -- use 25%.

### Allowances (Olajšave) 2025

| Allowance | Value (EUR) |
|---|---|
| General (basic) personal allowance -- splošna olajšava | 5,260.00 (for total annual income above 16,832.00) |
| Increased general allowance (income ≤ 16,832.00) | 5,260.00 + (19,736.99 − 1.17259 × total annual income) |
| 1st dependent child | 2,838.30 |
| 2nd dependent child | 3,085.52 |
| 3rd dependent child | 5,146.39 |
| 4th dependent child | 7,207.26 |
| 5th dependent child | 9,268.12 |
| Each further child (6th+) | +2,060.87 each |
| Child needing special care | 10,285.40 |
| Other dependent family member | 2,838.30 |
| Young workers (resident under 29, employment income) | 1,367.60 |
| Disability allowance (100% disabled resident) | 18,188.61 |

Sources: zvezarfr.si official 2025 scale & allowances; PwC deductions page. (PwC deductions tables showed 2024 figures at fetch time -- 2025 amounts here come from the Slovenian accountancy association and should be cross-checked against the FURS-published 2025 lestvica.)

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency | STOP -- residents taxed on worldwide income, non-residents on Slovenian-source only; cannot proceed without residency |
| Unknown total annual income (for allowance) | Use standard 5,260 general allowance; apply increased-allowance formula ONLY when income ≤ 16,832.00 |
| Income type unclear (progressive vs capital) | Treat employment/business/pension on progressive scale; dividends/interest/rental cedular at 25% |
| Self-employed expense method unknown | Use actual costs (do NOT assume normirani odhodki without confirmation of eligibility and turnover tier) |
| Contribution period spans 1 July 2025 | Use 22.10% / 16.10% before 1 July; add 1pp each side (LTC) from 1 July onward |
| OZP flat health contribution | Apply EUR 37.17/month per insured adult from 1 March 2025 (separate from percentage contributions) |
| Unknown holding period (capital gain) | Treat as 0–5 years → 25% (most conservative, highest tax) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume below 60,000 threshold unless turnover proves otherwise; confirm before applying VAT |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of tax residency (resident / non-resident), income type (employment, self-employment/s.p., pension, capital), and (for self-employed) whether actual-cost or normirani odhodki accounting applies.

**Recommended** -- all sales/output invoices, purchase invoices and receipts, monthly OPSVZ/REK contribution statements (self-employed), prior-year IID or DohDej assessment, number and order of dependent children, age (for the under-29 allowance), and VAT registration status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, fixed-asset register with depreciation schedule, advance-tax (akontacija) payment confirmations, capital-income (dividend/interest/rental) statements with acquisition dates for gains, and the prior-year informative calculation.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all business expenses are supported by valid documentation and that the income is correctly split between the progressive base and cedular capital income."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-SI-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Slovenia taxes residents on worldwide income and non-residents only on Slovenian-source income. This skill cannot compute dohodnina without confirmed tax-residency status. Please confirm before proceeding." (PwC)

**R-SI-2 -- Companies / d.o.o. / partnerships.** "This skill covers resident individuals and sole proprietors (s.p.) only. Limited companies (d.o.o.) pay corporate income tax (davek od dohodkov pravnih oseb) under a separate regime. Escalate to a Slovenian tax adviser."

**R-SI-3 -- Capital gains on real estate / securities with complex acquisition history.** "Capital-gains computations require verified acquisition dates, cost basis, and holding-period mapping to the 25/20/15/0% schedule. Where records are incomplete, escalate to a Slovenian tax adviser."

**R-SI-4 -- normirani odhodki tier uncertainty.** "The lump-sum expense (normirani odhodki) regime changed twice around 2025 -- restrictive tiered rules from 1 Jan 2025, then raised revenue caps from 2026. The deemed-expense percentage for a given 2025 turnover must be verified against the current ZDoh-2 text / FURS guidance. Do not compute the deemed deduction without that confirmation."

**R-SI-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to FURS enforcement. Statutory default interest accrues daily and fines can reach EUR 75,000 for serious breaches. Do not advise. Escalate to a Slovenian tax adviser immediately." (Commenda)

**R-SI-6 -- VAT (DDV) return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax (dohodnina / DohDej) only. For Slovenian VAT (DDV), use the dedicated VAT skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (VAT-registered s.p.)

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; NLB NAKAZILO ; STUDIO KREBS D.O.O. ; PLAČILO RAČUNA 2025-003 ; +1,220.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Client payment for services. The s.p. is VAT-registered, so EUR 1,220 includes 22% DDV. Net = 1,220 / 1.22 = EUR 1,000.00 (business income, progressive base). EUR 220.00 is VAT collected -- excluded from income (a liability to FURS).

**Classification:** Business income = EUR 1,000.00. VAT EUR 220.00 excluded.

### Example 2 -- SaaS Subscription (Deductible)

**Input line:**
`01.04.2025 ; NLB SDD ; ADOBE SYSTEMS IRELAND ; CREATIVE CLOUD APR ; -29.99 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring operating expense. Fully deductible against business income (actual-cost method). For VAT-registered s.p., net of recoverable input VAT is the expense; otherwise the gross EUR 29.99 is the cost.

**Classification:** Deductible expense = EUR 29.99 (or net if VAT-recoverable).

### Example 3 -- Dividend Received (Cedular, Not Progressive)

**Input line:**
`30.04.2025 ; NLB DOBROPIS ; DIVIDENDA XYZ D.D. ; ; +800.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Dividend income is taxed cedularly at a flat 25%, final and SEPARATE from the progressive scale (PwC income-determination). It is NOT added to the business/employment base. Tax = 800 × 25% = EUR 200.00 (typically withheld at source).

**Classification:** Capital income -- dividend. Cedular 25% = EUR 200.00. Do NOT add to progressive base.

### Example 4 -- Self-Employed Social Contributions Paid

**Input line:**
`20.05.2025 ; NLB SDD ; FURS PRISPEVKI OPSVZ ; APRIL 2025 ; -260.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Self-employed social security contributions (OPSVZ). The self-employed person pays both employee and employer shares on the contribution base (minimum base ~237.02 EUR/month in 2025; minimum base = 60% of average gross wage) (Crowe; tax-checker). These reduce the self-employment base but are tracked separately from ordinary trading expenses. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the exact 2025 minimum monthly contribution amount against the FURS contribution brochure.]

**Classification:** Social contributions (deductible from s.p. base). Track separately, not as a trading-expense line.

### Example 5 -- OZP Flat Health Contribution

**Input line:**
`05.05.2025 ; NLB SDD ; OBVEZNI ZDRAVSTVENI PRISPEVEK ; ZZZS ; -37.17 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
The compulsory health contribution (OZP) is a FLAT monthly amount of EUR 37.17 per insured adult from 1 March 2025 (was EUR 35.00 from Jan 2024–Feb 2025), adjusted annually on 1 March by average wage growth (ZDS). It is NOT a percentage and is separate from the 6.36%/6.56% ZZZS percentage contributions.

**Classification:** OZP flat health contribution = EUR 37.17. Separate from percentage contributions.

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15.06.2025 ; NLB INTERNI PRENOS ; LASTNI RAČUN - VARČEVANJE ; ; -2,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency and Scope

**Legislation:** ZDoh-2 (PwC)

Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Slovenian-source income. Confirm residency before any computation.

### 5.2 The Progressive Scale (dohodnina)

The 2025 annual scale is applied to the **tax base** (net annual income after allowances) for employment, self-employment/business, and pension income:

| Annual Tax Base (EUR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 9,210.26 | 16% |
| 9,210.26 -- 27,089.00 | 26% |
| 27,089.00 -- 54,178.00 | 33% |
| 54,178.00 -- 78,016.32 | 39% |
| 78,016.32+ | 50% |

Source: zvezarfr.si official 2025 scale; PwC.

### 5.3 Capital Income -- Cedular Treatment

Dividends, interest, and rental income are taxed at a flat **25%** as final tax, separate from the progressive scale. Bank deposit interest is exempt up to EUR 1,000/year (EU institutions). Capital gains are taxed by holding period: 25% (0–5 yrs), 20% (5–10 yrs), 15% (10–15 yrs), 0% (>15 yrs) (PwC income-determination).

### 5.4 General and Family Allowances

- General (basic) allowance for 2025: EUR 5,260.00 for total annual income above EUR 16,832.00.
- For total annual income ≤ EUR 16,832.00, an increased allowance applies: 5,260.00 + (19,736.99 − 1.17259 × total annual income).
- Family allowances apply per Section 1 (1st child 2,838.30; 2nd 3,085.52; etc.).
- Young workers (resident under 29) get an extra EUR 1,367.60 on employment income; 100%-disabled resident allowance is EUR 18,188.61.

Source: zvezarfr.si; PwC.

### 5.5 Social Security Contributions -- Employment

**Legislation:** ZPIZ-2; ZZVZZ; ZDOsk-1 (PwC; KPMG)

**Employee contributions (deducted from gross salary):**

| Class | Rate (pre-1 July 2025) |
|---|---|
| Pension & disability (ZPIZ) | 15.50% |
| Health (ZZZS) | 6.36% |
| Unemployment | 0.14% |
| Parental protection | 0.10% |
| **Total (pre-1 July 2025)** | **22.10%** |
| + Long-term care (ZDOsk-1, from 1 July 2025) | +1.00% |
| **Total (from 1 July 2025)** | **23.10%** |

Verification: 15.50 + 6.36 + 0.14 + 0.10 = 22.10%; +1.00% LTC = 23.10%. (PwC other-taxes; KPMG Flash Alert 2025-133.)

**Employer contributions (on top of gross salary):**

| Class | Rate (pre-1 July 2025) |
|---|---|
| Pension & disability (ZPIZ) | 8.85% |
| Health (ZZZS) | 6.56% |
| Unemployment | 0.06% |
| Parental protection | 0.10% |
| Injury at work / occupational disease | 0.53% |
| **Total (pre-1 July 2025)** | **16.10%** |
| + Long-term care (ZDOsk-1, from 1 July 2025) | +1.00% |
| **Total (from 1 July 2025)** | **17.10%** |

Verification: 8.85 + 6.56 + 0.06 + 0.10 + 0.53 = 16.10%; +1.00% LTC = 17.10%. (PwC other-taxes; KPMG.)

Contributions are due on the day wages/salaries are paid (PwC).

### 5.6 OZP Flat Health Contribution

Separate flat compulsory health contribution (OZP, Obvezni zdravstveni prispevek): **EUR 37.17/month** per insured adult from 1 March 2025 (was EUR 35.00 from Jan 2024–Feb 2025). Adjusted annually on 1 March by average gross wage growth. Replaced the abolished voluntary supplementary health insurance. (ZDS.)

### 5.7 Long-Term Care Contribution (ZDOsk-1)

From 1 July 2025, a new LTC contribution applies: 1% employee + 1% employer of gross salary; self-employed pay 2% (both shares); pensioners pay 1% of net pension. First applied to July 2025 payroll. (KPMG Flash Alert 2025-133.)

### 5.8 Self-Employed (s.p.) -- Income Tax and Contributions

- Self-employed pay both income tax (on the progressive scale, via DohDej) and the full social contributions themselves.
- Minimum contribution base: 60% of the average gross wage (≈ EUR 237.02/month minimum contribution in 2025, rising to ≈ EUR 303.11 in 2026 as the base moves toward 60% of average wage). (Crowe; tax-checker.) [RESEARCH GAP -- confirm the exact 2025 minimum figure and base percentage against the FURS contribution brochure.]
- Maximum contribution base: 3.5 × the insured's average monthly wage. (tax-checker.)

### 5.9 normirani odhodki (Lump-Sum Expense) Regime

**Legislation:** ZDoh-2 (Sibiz)

- Optional regime with 80% deemed expenses, subject to revenue caps.
- 2025: full-time s.p. revenue cap EUR 60,000 (EUR 50,000 part-time); a reformed tiered system applies the 80% deemed-expense rate only within lower turnover tiers.
- A November 2025 law later raised the caps to EUR 120,000 / EUR 50,000 effective **from 2026**.
- For a given 2025 turnover, the precise tiered deemed-expense percentage and contribution-base treatment MUST be verified against current ZDoh-2 / FURS guidance before computing. (Sibiz.) [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm 2025 tier percentages.]

### 5.10 Minimum Wage and Holiday Allowance

- 2025 minimum gross monthly wage: EUR 1,277.72 (+1.9% over 2024's EUR 1,253.90); rises to EUR 1,481.88 for 2026. (WageIndicator; SeeNews.)
- Holiday allowance (regres): statutory annual payment at least equal to the minimum wage; tax/contribution-exempt up to a cap tied to the average wage. (Sibiz.)

### 5.11 Non-Deductible Expenses (Self-Employed Actual-Cost)

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Personal / private living costs | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax (dohodnina) itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Private-use portion of mixed expenses | Apportion -- only business % deductible |

### 5.12 VAT Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT collected on sales (registered) | NOT income -- exclude from business revenue |
| Input VAT recovered (registered) | NOT an expense -- exclude from cost |
| Non-registered (below 60,000 threshold) | Gross amounts are income/cost (no VAT line) |

VAT registration threshold raised to EUR 60,000 annual taxable turnover from 2025 (was 50,000). (Taxually.)

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 normirani odhodki Election and Tier

- The choice between actual-cost and normirani odhodki, and the applicable 2025 tier, materially changes the tax base.
- **Conservative default:** use actual costs until eligibility, turnover tier, and the 2025 deemed-expense percentage are confirmed.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm 2025 turnover, full-time vs part-time status, and current ZDoh-2 tier rules.

### 6.2 Home Office Deduction

- Calculate the proportion of the home used exclusively for business (dedicated room/floor area).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity, heating, internet, maintenance.
- A dual-use room does NOT qualify.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until reviewer confirms the arrangement.

### 6.3 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible.
- Client must maintain a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a log is provided.

### 6.4 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; client must provide a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.5 Capital Gains Holding-Period Mapping

- Mapping a disposal to the correct 25/20/15/0% band depends on verified acquisition and disposal dates.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm acquisition date, cost basis, and disposal proceeds.

### 6.6 Contribution-Period Split Across 1 July 2025

- Payroll periods spanning 1 July 2025 mix the pre-LTC (22.10%/16.10%) and post-LTC (23.10%/17.10%) rates; the LTC contribution first applied to July 2025 payroll.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm which payroll month(s) include the LTC contribution.

### 6.7 Increased vs Standard General Allowance

- The increased general allowance applies only where total annual income ≤ EUR 16,832.00; the formula is income-sensitive.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm total annual income before selecting the allowance formula.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Self-employed (s.p.), actual cost, single, no children.**
Input: business income EUR 50,000, deductible expenses EUR 20,000, general allowance EUR 5,260, no other progressive income.
Net profit = 50,000 − 20,000 = EUR 30,000. Tax base = 30,000 − 5,260 = EUR 24,740.
Expected tax (progressive): base falls in band 2. Tax = 1,473.64 + (24,740 − 9,210.26) × 26% = 1,473.64 + 15,529.74 × 26% = 1,473.64 + 4,037.73 = **EUR 5,511.37**.

**Test 2 -- Employee monthly net pay, gross EUR 2,500/month, pre-1 July 2025, single.**
Employee social contributions = 2,500 × 22.10% = EUR 552.50.
Monthly general-allowance relief = 5,260 / 12 = EUR 438.33.
Monthly tax base = 2,500 − 552.50 − 438.33 = EUR 1,509.17.
Monthly bracket thresholds: 9,210.26/12 = 767.52 (16% band), 27,089/12 = 2,257.42 (26% band).
Advance tax = 767.52 × 16% + (1,509.17 − 767.52) × 26% = 122.80 + 741.65 × 26% = 122.80 + 192.83 = EUR 315.63.
Net pay (before OZP) = 2,500 − 552.50 − 315.63 = **EUR 1,631.87**. After OZP (37.17) = **EUR 1,594.70**.
(Employer additionally pays 2,500 × 16.10% = EUR 402.50 on top.) [RESEARCH GAP -- the exact monthly akontacija formula/order of allowance application should be confirmed against FURS payroll guidance; figures here apply the scale on a 1/12 basis.]

**Test 3 -- Same employee, from 1 July 2025 (LTC added).**
Employee contributions = 2,500 × 23.10% = EUR 577.50 (includes 1% LTC = EUR 25.00).
Employer contributions = 2,500 × 17.10% = EUR 427.50.

**Test 4 -- Dividend (cedular).**
Input: dividend EUR 5,000.
Expected: 5,000 × 25% = **EUR 1,250** final tax. NOT added to progressive base.

**Test 5 -- Bank deposit interest with exemption.**
Input: bank deposit interest EUR 1,400 (EU institution).
Expected: taxable = 1,400 − 1,000 exemption = EUR 400; tax = 400 × 25% = **EUR 100**.

**Test 6 -- Capital gain by holding period.**
Input: gain EUR 10,000 on securities held 7 years.
Expected: 5–10 year band → 20% = **EUR 2,000** final tax.

**Test 7 -- normirani odhodki (flagged, not computed).**
Input: s.p. turnover EUR 40,000, elects normirani odhodki.
Expected: STOP and flag -- confirm the 2025 tiered deemed-expense percentage and contribution-base treatment before computing (R-SI-4). Do not assume a flat 80% without confirming the tier.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute dohodnina without confirmed tax residency
- NEVER add capital income (dividends/interest/rental/gains) to the progressive base -- it is cedular at 25% (or the holding-period CG rate)
- NEVER assume the increased general allowance without confirming total annual income ≤ EUR 16,832.00
- NEVER apply a flat 80% normirani odhodki deduction without confirming the 2025 turnover tier and eligibility
- NEVER apply post-LTC contribution rates (23.10%/17.10%) before 1 July 2025, nor pre-LTC rates after it
- NEVER treat the OZP flat health contribution (EUR 37.17/month) as a percentage or merge it with ZZZS percentage contributions
- NEVER allow income tax itself, fines, penalties, or drawings as a business deduction
- NEVER include VAT (DDV) collected on sales in business income for a registered s.p.
- NEVER present the band-5 base or any progressive figure as definitive where flagged as a [RESEARCH GAP]
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated and route to a qualified reviewer
