## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

- **Required inputs before computing** — Before computing, you MUST obtain: 1. Self-employment type -- egyéni vállalkozó (sole proprietor) vs KATA taxpayer vs freelancer? 2. Monthly income / chosen contribution base 3. Is the client full-time (főállású) or part-time (mellékállású)? -- minimum base rules differ 4. Does the client opt for itemized or flat-rate taxation? 5. Any concurrent employment? -- affects minimum base. If self-employment type is unknown, STOP.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-HU-SOC-1 -- Cross-border worker** — Trigger: client works in Hungary and another EU state. Message: "EU Regulation 883/2004 requires A1 certificate determination. Escalate."

### Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions list** — NEVER compute without knowing főállású vs mellékállású -- minimum base rules differ completely. NEVER apply a cap on TB or SZOCHO -- there is no upper ceiling. NEVER confuse SZOCHO (13%, tax) with TB járulék (18.5%, insurance contribution). NEVER advise a KATA taxpayer to invoice companies -- only natural persons since September 2022. NEVER forget the minimum base is minimum wage (HUF 266,800) or guaranteed minimum (HUF 326,000). NEVER state that mellékállású has a minimum base -- it does not. NEVER present KATA as available for B2B freelancers. NEVER ignore pro-rating for partial months.

## Section 3 -- Two-layer contribution system

- **Legislation reference** — Tbj. 2019. évi CXXII.; Szocho tv. 2018. évi LII.  _(Tbj. 2019. évi CXXII.; Szocho tv. 2018. évi LII.)_

**Two-layer contribution system**  _(Tbj. 2019. évi CXXII.; Szocho tv. 2018. évi LII.)_

## Section 4 -- Contribution base and minimum rules (2025)

- **Legislation reference** — Tbj. Sections 36-40  _(Tbj. Sections 36-40)_

### Főállású (full-time) sole proprietor

- **Contribution base formula (standard)** — contribution_base = max(actual_monthly_income, minimum_wage)  _(Tbj. Sections 36-40)_
- **Contribution base formula (skilled trade)** — contribution_base = max(actual_monthly_income, guaranteed_minimum_wage)  _(Tbj. Sections 36-40)_

**Minimum base table**

| Minimum base | Monthly |
| --- | --- |
| Minimum wage | HUF 266,800 |
| Guaranteed minimum (skilled) | HUF 326,000 |

### Mellékállású (part-time, concurrent employment)

- **Part-time rules** — No minimum contribution base. TB and SZOCHO on actual self-employment income only. If income is zero, contributions are zero.

### Step 5.1 -- Determine contribution base

- **Determine contribution base** — IF mellékállású: base = actual_self_employment_income ELIF skilled_trade: base = max(actual_income, 326,000) ELSE: base = max(actual_income, 266,800)

### Step 5.2 -- Monthly contributions

- **Monthly contributions formula** — TB_monthly = base x 18.50% SZOCHO_monthly = base x 13.00% total_monthly = TB_monthly + SZOCHO_monthly

### Step 5.3 -- Annual and quarterly

- **Annual and quarterly formula** — annual_total = total_monthly x 12 quarterly_payment = total_monthly x 3

## Section 6 -- Payment schedule and tax deductibility

### Payment schedule

**Payment schedule table**

| Obligation | Frequency | Due date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TB járulék | Monthly | 12th of following month |
| SZOCHO | Monthly | 12th of following month |
| Annual reconciliation | Annually | With SZJA return (May 20) |

Monthly declarations (08-as bevallás) filed to NAV.

### Tax deductibility

**Tax deductibility table**

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| Is TB deductible? | Partially -- pension component (10%) is deductible |
| Is SZOCHO deductible? | YES -- business expense for sole proprietors |

## Section 7 -- KATA regime and flat-rate taxation

### KATA (from September 2022)

**KATA parameters table**

| Fixed monthly tax | HUF 50,000 |
| Covers | Income tax + social contributions |
