# North Macedonia Personal Income Tax -- Individuals & Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified) skill.** Figures below are drawn from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, the Eurofast North Macedonia Tax Card 2025 / Payroll Guide 2025, and Bloomberg Tax reporting the Public Revenue Office's January 2025 wage-threshold clarification. Several material figures (the 28% contribution split, the MKD 10,270 personal exemption, the MKD 63,154 average salary, and the MKD 31,577 / 1,010,464 / 757,848 contribution bases) could not be re-rendered directly from a machine-readable UJP/Ministry of Finance page during research and should be reconfirmed against the official UJP "contribution bases" table and the State Statistical Office average-salary release before sign-off. Items marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** are unresolved.

### PIT Rate Schedule (2025)

North Macedonia applies a **flat tax**, not progressive brackets. There is no cumulative-bracket table; each income type is taxed at a single rate.

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employment income | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Self-employment / business income | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Royalties and industrial-property rights | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Sale of own agricultural products | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Rental income | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Income from capital (dividends, interest) | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Capital gains (taxable) | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Insurance income | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Other uncategorised taxable income | 10% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Gains from games of chance | 15% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Income of unproven origin | 70% | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Capital gains on securities / investment-fund shares held > 2 years | 0% (exempt) | PwC, Taxes on personal income |
| Gains from termed deposits | 0% (taxation postponed until EU accession) | PwC, Taxes on personal income |

**There are no progressive bands. The flat 10% is the headline rate for almost all income.** Personal relief takes the form of a fixed monthly exemption (see below), not a 0% band.

### Social Contribution Rates (2025) -- borne entirely by the employee on gross salary

| Class (Macedonian) | Employee rate | Employer rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pension and disability insurance (Пензиско и инвалидско осигурување) | 18.8% | 0% | PwC, Other taxes |
| Health insurance (Здравствено осигурување) | 7.5% | 0% | PwC, Other taxes |
| Unemployment insurance (Осигурување во случај на невработеност) | 1.2% | 0% | PwC, Other taxes |
| Additional health / disability (work-injury / occupational-disease)* | 0.5% | 0% | PwC, Other taxes |
| **TOTAL mandatory social contributions** | **28.0%** | **0%** | Eurofast Tax Card 2025 |

*The 0.5% component is labelled "additional health insurance" by PwC and "disability" by the Eurofast Tax Card; both agree on the 0.5% rate and the 28% total.

**Arithmetic check:** 18.8 + 7.5 + 1.2 + 0.5 = **28.0%** (employee column). Employer column: 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = **0%**. North Macedonia has **no separate employer-side social contribution** — the entire burden sits on the employee's gross salary and is withheld/remitted by the employer [PwC; Eurofast Tax Card 2025].

### Contribution Bases (2025)

| Base | Amount (per month) | Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| National average gross salary (reference) | MKD 63,154 | State Statistical Office figure published Jan 2025 | PwC, Other taxes |
| Minimum contribution base (floor) | MKD 31,577 | 50% of average gross salary (63,154 × 0.50) | Bloomberg Tax citing PRO |
| Maximum contribution base — employees (ceiling) | MKD 1,010,464 | 16 average gross salaries (63,154 × 16) | Bloomberg Tax citing PRO |
| Maximum contribution base — self-employed | MKD 757,848 | 12 average gross salaries (63,154 × 12) | Bloomberg Tax citing PRO |

**Arithmetic check:** 63,154 × 0.50 = 31,577 ✓ · 63,154 × 16 = 1,010,464 ✓ · 63,154 × 12 = 757,848 ✓. Ceiling (1,010,464) ≥ floor (31,577) ✓.

### Personal Exemption & Wage Reference Figures (2025)

| Item | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly personal tax-free exemption (salary only) | MKD 10,270 / month | Eurofast Tax Card 2025 |
| Minimum gross wage (effective March 2025) | MKD 36,037 / month (net ≈ MKD 24,379; hourly ≈ MKD 207) | Pepeljugoski law office |
| Business-activity registration threshold | MKD 1,000,000 total annual income | PwC, Income determination |
| VAT registration threshold | MKD 2,000,000 turnover | Company Formation Macedonia |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown income type | Treat as "other income" at flat 10% — do NOT assume an exemption applies |
| Unknown whether income is salary | Do NOT apply the MKD 10,270 exemption (it is salary-only) |
| Unknown employment vs service-contract status | Service contract (PIT only, no social contributions on it) [Eurofast] |
| Unknown gross-vs-net of a salary figure | STOP — ask whether the figure is gross or net before computing |
| Unknown contribution base relief | Apply contributions on actual gross between the floor and ceiling |
| Unknown self-employed contribution ceiling | Use self-employed maximum base MKD 757,848/month |
| Unknown allowance-style base reduction | Do NOT apply (use full gross) until reviewer confirms the income category |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume not registered (no VAT split) until confirmed |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — for a salary computation: the gross monthly salary in MKD and confirmation that the figure is gross. For self-employment: the annual net business income (tax balance) or a full-year bank statement in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of resident status.

**Recommended** — payslips / MPIN declarations for the year, the income category for each receipt (employment, service contract, rental, royalty, agricultural, capital, capital gain), SSC payment records, prior-year tax balance, VAT registration status.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account for self-employed clients, asset register, prior-year annual accounts / tax balance, evidence supporting any base reductions (agricultural sales, IP rights, property lease deductions).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No salary figure / no bank statement at all = hard stop. A salary figure with no gross/net confirmation = hard stop (the entire computation hinges on it). A bank statement without supporting invoices for a self-employed client = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from the bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify the income categorisation and that any base reductions or deductible contributions are supported."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-MK-1 — Gross/net of salary unknown.** "The whole gross-to-net calculation depends on whether the figure is the gross salary (бруто плата) or the net salary (нето плата). This skill cannot compute tax without that confirmation. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-MK-2 — Companies / legal entities.** "This skill covers individuals and sole self-employed persons only. Profit tax for companies (corporate income tax) is a separate regime. Escalate to a North Macedonia licensed accountant."

**R-MK-3 — Non-resident / cross-border income.** "Non-resident taxation, double-tax-treaty relief, and foreign-salary positions require specialised analysis. Out of scope here (note: salary received from abroad must be reported by 31 March of the following year [PwC]). Escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-MK-4 — Income of unproven origin.** "Income of unproven origin is taxed at 70% and triggers a formal PRO assessment. Do not self-classify. Escalate to a licensed accountant immediately."

**R-MK-5 — Games of chance / gambling.** "Gains from games of chance are taxed at a special 15% rate with their own reporting. Confirm the exact nature before applying any rate. Escalate if material."

**R-MK-6 — VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax and social contributions only. For North Macedonia VAT (DDV-04), use the dedicated VAT skill."

**R-MK-7 — Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to PRO enforcement. Assessed tax under a Tax Assessment resolution must be paid within 15 days of delivery [PwC]; specific penalty amounts under the PIT Law for individuals are a research gap. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Macedonian terms are given alongside Latin transliterations and English. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

> All examples use the 2025 methodology: **monthly salary PIT = (gross − 28% social contributions − MKD 10,270 personal exemption) × 10%** [Eurofast Payroll Guide 2025]. Each figure is recomputed end-to-end below.

### Example 1 -- Employee at the national average gross salary

**Input line:**
`25/03/2025 ; NLB PLATA ; DELOVNO DRUSTVO XYZ DOOEL ; PLATA MART ; +41,950.79 ; MKD`

**Reasoning:**
Gross salary MKD 63,154 (the 2025 average). Gross is above the floor (31,577) and below the ceiling (1,010,464), so contributions apply on the full gross.
- Social contributions: 63,154 × 28% = **MKD 17,683.12**
- After contributions: 63,154 − 17,683.12 = **MKD 45,470.88**
- Less personal exemption: 45,470.88 − 10,270 = **MKD 35,200.88** (PIT base)
- PIT at 10%: 35,200.88 × 0.10 = **MKD 3,520.09**
- Net pay: 45,470.88 − 3,520.09 = **MKD 41,950.79**

**Classification:** Contributions MKD 17,683.12; PIT MKD 3,520.09; net pay MKD 41,950.79. (Reconciles to the credit line.)

### Example 2 -- Minimum-wage employee

**Input line:**
`25/04/2025 ; KOMERCIJALNA ; FIRMA ABC ; NETO PLATA ; +24,378.98 ; MKD`

**Reasoning:**
Minimum gross wage MKD 36,037 (effective March 2025). Above the floor, below the ceiling.
- Social contributions: 36,037 × 28% = **MKD 10,090.36**
- After contributions: 36,037 − 10,090.36 = **MKD 25,946.64**
- Less personal exemption: 25,946.64 − 10,270 = **MKD 15,676.64** (PIT base)
- PIT at 10%: 15,676.64 × 0.10 = **MKD 1,567.66**
- Net pay: 25,946.64 − 1,567.66 = **MKD 24,378.98** ≈ MKD 24,379 (matches published minimum-wage net)

**Classification:** Contributions MKD 10,090.36; PIT MKD 1,567.66; net pay MKD 24,379.

### Example 3 -- Higher-paid employee (below the ceiling)

**Input line:**
`25/05/2025 ; STOPANSKA ; TECH DOO ; PLATA MAJ ; +78,787.00 ; MKD`

**Reasoning:**
Gross salary MKD 120,000. Still below the ceiling (1,010,464), so contributions on full gross.
- Social contributions: 120,000 × 28% = **MKD 33,600.00**
- After contributions: 120,000 − 33,600 = **MKD 86,400.00**
- Less personal exemption: 86,400 − 10,270 = **MKD 76,130.00** (PIT base)
- PIT at 10%: 76,130 × 0.10 = **MKD 7,613.00**
- Net pay: 86,400 − 7,613 = **MKD 78,787.00**

**Classification:** Contributions MKD 33,600; PIT MKD 7,613; net pay MKD 78,787.

### Example 4 -- Service-contract (договор на дело) income -- PIT only, no contributions

**Input line:**
`12/06/2025 ; NLB ; AGENCIJA MEDIA DOO ; HONORAR DOGOVOR NA DELO ; +45,000.00 ; MKD`

**Reasoning:**
Service-contract income paid by a legal entity to an individual is subject **only to PIT — no social contributions** [Eurofast Tax Card 2025]. The MKD 10,270 salary exemption does **not** apply (it is salary-only). The payer withholds/declares.
- PIT at 10%: 45,000 × 0.10 = **MKD 4,500.00**
- Net to individual: 45,000 − 4,500 = **MKD 40,500.00**

**Classification:** PIT MKD 4,500; no contributions; net MKD 40,500. File via the monthly PIT calculation by the 10th, pay by the 15th of the following month [PwC].

### Example 5 -- Self-employed annual net business income

**Input:** Self-employed individual keeping accounting records; annual net income (tax balance) for 2025 = MKD 800,000.

**Reasoning:**
Self-employment / business income is taxed at the flat 10% on net income from the tax balance [PwC]. No dedicated lump-sum/presumptive PIT regime was located **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether a presumptive regime exists for small craftsmen/entrepreneurs]**. Contributions are computed separately on a contribution base capped at the self-employed maximum (MKD 757,848/month).
- Annual PIT: 800,000 × 0.10 = **MKD 80,000.00**

Filing: annual accounts + annual tax return by **15 March** of the following year; final settlement by **30 June**; monthly advance payments equal one-twelfth of the prior year's liability [PwC].

**Classification:** Annual PIT MKD 80,000 (excl. social contributions, computed separately).

### Example 6 -- Games-of-chance winnings (special 15% rate)

**Input line:**
`30/07/2025 ; HALKBANK ; LOTARIJA NA MK ; DOBIVKA IGRI NA SREKA ; +100,000.00 ; MKD`

**Reasoning:**
Gains from games of chance are taxed at the **special 15% rate**, not 10% [PwC].
- PIT at 15%: 100,000 × 0.15 = **MKD 15,000.00**

**Classification:** PIT MKD 15,000 at the games-of-chance rate. Do NOT apply 10% and do NOT apply the salary exemption.

### Example 7 -- Salary above the contribution ceiling

**Input:** Gross monthly salary MKD 1,200,000 (above the employee ceiling base of MKD 1,010,464).

**Reasoning:**
Contributions are capped: they apply only on the ceiling base, not the full gross.
- Contributions: 1,010,464 × 28% = **MKD 282,929.92** (capped)
- After contributions: 1,200,000 − 282,929.92 = **MKD 917,070.08**
- Less personal exemption: 917,070.08 − 10,270 = **MKD 906,800.08** (PIT base)
- PIT at 10%: 906,800.08 × 0.10 = **MKD 90,680.01**
- Net pay: 917,070.08 − 90,680.01 = **MKD 826,390.07**

**Classification:** Contributions MKD 282,929.92 (capped at the ceiling); PIT MKD 90,680.01; net pay MKD 826,390.07. Note PIT itself is NOT capped — only the contribution base is.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Flat 10% Rule

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax (Official Gazette 241/2018 and amendments)

PIT is a flat **10%** on virtually all income types — employment, self-employment/business, rental, capital (dividends/interest), taxable capital gains, royalties, agricultural sales, insurance, and other uncategorised income — for tax year 2025 [PwC]. Two special rates override the flat rate: **15%** on games-of-chance gains and **70%** on income of unproven origin [PwC].

### 5.2 Gross-to-Net Salary Computation

**Legislation:** Law on Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions; Eurofast Payroll Guide 2025

The order of operations for salary is strict:
1. Start from **gross salary** (бруто плата).
2. Deduct **28%** social contributions (on gross between floor and ceiling).
3. Deduct the **MKD 10,270** monthly personal exemption.
4. Apply **10%** PIT to the remainder (the PIT base).
5. Net pay = gross − contributions − PIT.

All payments (net wage, contributions, PIT) are remitted concurrently via a single encrypted payment order — the **MPIN salary declaration** [Eurofast].

### 5.3 Social Contributions

**Legislation:** Law on Mandatory Social Insurance Contributions

Total mandatory contributions are **28% of gross salary** (pension/disability 18.8%, health 7.5%, unemployment 1.2%, additional/disability 0.5%), all borne by the employee and withheld/remitted by the employer; there is **no separate employer-side contribution** [PwC; Eurofast Tax Card 2025]. Contributions are levied on gross salary between a **floor of MKD 31,577/month** and a **ceiling of MKD 1,010,464/month** for 2025 [Bloomberg Tax citing PRO]. For self-employed persons the maximum contribution base is **MKD 757,848/month** (12 average salaries) [Bloomberg Tax citing PRO]. Contributions on employment income are **fully deductible** when computing the PIT base [Eurofast Tax Card 2025].

### 5.4 The Personal Exemption (salary only)

**Legislation:** Eurofast Tax Card 2025

The 2025 monthly personal tax-free exemption is **MKD 10,270**, deducted from salary before applying 10% PIT [Eurofast]. **Apply it only to salary/employment income** — do not assume it applies to service contracts, business income, rental, or other categories (see Conservative Defaults).

### 5.5 Income-Category Base Reductions

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax (per PwC, Income determination)

| Income category | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Sale of own agricultural products | Gross reduced by 20% (base = 80%) | PwC, Income determination |
| Royalties / industrial-property rights | Base = 90% of gross | PwC, Income determination |
| Unfurnished property lease | 10% deduction from gross rent | PwC, Income determination |
| Furnished property lease | 15% deduction from gross rent | PwC, Income determination |

Apply 10% PIT to the reduced base. Do not stack the salary exemption on top of these — they are mutually exclusive categories.

### 5.6 Capital Gains

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax (per PwC)

Taxable capital gains are taxed at 10%. **Exempt:** capital gains on securities and investment-fund shares held longer than **two years** (0%); gains from termed deposits are not taxed until EU accession [PwC].

### 5.7 Self-Employed / Business Income

**Legislation:** Law on Personal Income Tax (per PwC)

Self-employed individuals who keep accounting records are taxed at 10% on **net income** from the tax balance. They file annual accounts and an annual tax return by **15 March** of the following year, with final settlement by **30 June**; monthly advance payments equal one-twelfth of the prior year's liability [PwC]. No dedicated lump-sum/presumptive regime for small entrepreneurs/craftsmen was located **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

### 5.8 Registration & VAT Interaction

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office / Mixed-Use Premises (self-employed)

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business and apply it to utilities, rent, and internet.
- Must be a genuinely dedicated workspace.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until the reviewer confirms the arrangement.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the floor-area basis and that the workspace is dedicated.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use (self-employed)

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and maintenance is deductible; requires a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a mileage log is provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; client must give a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Income Categorisation (which rate / which reduction)

- Whether a receipt is salary, service-contract income, business income, rental, royalty, or "other" changes the rate base, whether the MKD 10,270 exemption applies, and whether contributions are due.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the legal category of each material receipt before applying a reduction or exemption.

### 6.5 Entertainment / Client Hospitality (self-employed)

- North Macedonia's specific deductibility limits for entertainment were not pinned to an authoritative figure **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.
- **Conservative default:** Treat as NOT deductible until the reviewer confirms the wholly-and-exclusively basis.

### 6.6 Contribution Base Floor/Ceiling Edge Cases

- For very low salaries (below the MKD 31,577 floor) contributions may be computed on the floor base rather than actual gross.
- **Conservative default:** Apply the floor base where gross < floor; flag for reviewer.

### 6.7 Allowance-Style Base Reductions

- Agricultural (20%), IP rights (base 90%), lease (10%/15%) reductions depend on correct categorisation and documentation.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Confirm category and supporting evidence before applying a reduction.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client provides a bank statement or salary figure but cannot answer onboarding questions immediately:

1. Classify all transactions using the pattern library (Section 3).
2. Mark all Tier 2 items as "PENDING -- reviewer must confirm".
3. Apply conservative defaults (Section 1) — including treating ambiguous receipts as "other income" at 10% with no exemption.
4. Generate the working paper (Section 7) with clear flags.
5. Present the following questions to the client:

```
ONBOARDING QUESTIONS -- NORTH MACEDONIA PERSONAL INCOME TAX
1. Is the salary figure GROSS (бруто) or NET (нето)?
2. Employment status: employee (MPIN salary), service contract (договор на дело), or self-employed with accounting records?
3. For each material receipt: which category — salary, service contract, business, rental, royalty, agricultural, capital, capital gain, or games of chance?
4. Are you VAT-registered (turnover > MKD 2,000,000)?
5. Self-employed: what is the net business income (tax balance) for the year, and what was the prior-year liability (for monthly advances)?
6. Home office / vehicle / phone: any business-use percentage you can document?
7. Did total annual income exceed MKD 1,000,000 (business-registration trigger)?
8. Any income from abroad (foreign salary reportable by 31 March)?
9. Any games-of-chance winnings (taxed at 15%)?

| Games-of-chance rate | 15% | PwC |
| Income-of-unproven-origin rate | 70% | PwC |

### Research Caveats

- The 28% split, MKD 10,270 exemption, MKD 63,154 average salary, and MKD 31,577 / 1,010,464 / 757,848 bases come from PwC, Eurofast Tax Card 2025, and Bloomberg Tax (reporting the PRO's January 2025 clarification) rather than directly from a machine-readable UJP/Ministry page. **Reconfirm against the official UJP "contribution bases" table and the State Statistical Office average-salary release before publication.**
- The 0.5% component is "additional health insurance" (PwC) vs "disability" (Eurofast); both agree on 0.5% and a 28% total.
- Self-employed return deadline: treat **15 March** as operative (one secondary source said "end of February / 15 March electronically").
- No presumptive/lump-sum PIT regime for small entrepreneurs/craftsmen was found **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.
- Specific MKD penalty amounts under the PIT Law for individuals **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.
- Minimum wage MKD 36,037 was effective from March 2025; a further revision took effect 1 March 2026 (out of scope for the 2025 skill).
- Overall research confidence: **medium**.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Average-salary employee.**
Input: Gross MKD 63,154/month, employee.
Expected: Contributions = 17,683.12 (63,154 × 0.28); after-contributions 45,470.88; PIT base 35,200.88 (− 10,270); PIT 3,520.09; net pay 41,950.79.

**Test 2 -- Minimum-wage employee.**
Input: Gross MKD 36,037/month, employee.
Expected: Contributions = 10,090.36; after-contributions 25,946.64; PIT base 15,676.64; PIT 1,567.66; net pay 24,378.98 (≈ 24,379).

**Test 3 -- Higher-paid employee (below ceiling).**
Input: Gross MKD 120,000/month.
Expected: Contributions = 33,600.00; after-contributions 86,400.00; PIT base 76,130.00; PIT 7,613.00; net pay 78,787.00.

**Test 4 -- Salary above the contribution ceiling.**
Input: Gross MKD 1,200,000/month.
Expected: Contributions capped = 1,010,464 × 0.28 = 282,929.92; after-contributions 917,070.08; PIT base 906,800.08; PIT 90,680.01; net pay 826,390.07. (PIT is NOT capped; only the contribution base is.)

**Test 5 -- Service contract.**
Input: Service-contract fee MKD 45,000 from a legal entity.
Expected: PIT = 4,500 (10%); NO social contributions; NO MKD 10,270 exemption; net 40,500.

**Test 6 -- Self-employed annual.**
Input: Net business income MKD 800,000.
Expected: Annual PIT = 80,000 (10%); contributions computed separately on a base capped at MKD 757,848/month; advances = prior-year liability ÷ 12.

**Test 7 -- Games of chance (special rate).**
Input: Winnings MKD 100,000.
Expected: PIT = 15,000 (15%, not 10%); no exemption.

**Test 8 -- Wrong rate applied (negative test).**
Input: An agent computes games-of-chance winnings at 10%.
Expected: REJECT. Games of chance are 15% [PwC]. Recompute at 15%.

**Test 9 -- Exemption misapplied (negative test).**
Input: An agent deducts the MKD 10,270 exemption from service-contract income.
Expected: REJECT. The exemption is salary-only; service-contract income gets neither contributions nor the exemption.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute a salary net figure without confirming the input is GROSS, not net
- NEVER apply the MKD 10,270 personal exemption to anything other than salary/employment income
- NEVER add a separate employer-side social contribution — North Macedonia has none; the full 28% is on the employee
- NEVER apply 10% to games-of-chance winnings — they are taxed at 15%
- NEVER self-classify income of unproven origin (70%) — escalate
- NEVER apply social contributions to service-contract (договор на дело) income — it is PIT-only
- NEVER cap the PIT itself at the contribution ceiling — only the contribution base is capped
- NEVER stack a category base reduction (agri/IP/lease) on top of the salary exemption — categories are mutually exclusive
- NEVER report VAT collected as income for VAT-registered self-employed clients
- NEVER present a figure marked [RESEARCH GAP] as confirmed — flag it for the reviewer
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated
