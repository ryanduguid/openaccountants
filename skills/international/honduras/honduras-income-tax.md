### ISR Progressive Table — 2026 (CURRENT)

Indexed for inflation each year by SAR using the prior year's interannual CPI (4.98% for 2026). [SAR Comunicado 02-2026; Deloitte HN 12 Jan 2026; PwC, updated 27 Feb 2026]

| Annual net taxable income (HNL) | Monthly equivalent (HNL) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.01 – 228,324.32 | 0.01 – 22,360.36 | Exempt (0%) | L 0.00 |
| 228,324.33 – 348,154.10 | 22,360.37 – 32,346.18 | 15% | L 17,974.47 |
| 348,154.11 – 809,660.75 | 32,346.19 – 70,805.06 | 20% | L 110,275.80 |
| 809,660.76 and above | 70,805.07 and above | 25% | — |

**Cumulative-tax derivation (recomputed):**
- Band 2: (348,154.10 − 228,324.32) × 15% = 119,829.78 × 0.15 = **L 17,974.47**
- Band 3: (809,660.75 − 348,154.10) × 20% = 461,506.65 × 0.20 = 92,301.33; plus L 17,974.47 = **L 110,275.80**

### ISR Progressive Table — 2025 (FY2025 returns, filed by 30 Apr 2026)

Indexed using 3.88% CPI. [KPMG TaxNewsFlash 14 Jan 2025; Bloomberg Línea; SAR]

| Annual net taxable income (HNL) | Monthly equivalent (HNL) | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 217,493.16 | 0 – 21,457.76 | Exempt (0%) |
| 217,493.17 – 331,638 [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact centavos] | 21,457.77 – 30,969 | 15% |
| 331,638 – 771,252 [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact centavos] | 30,969 – 67,604 | 20% |
| 771,252 and above [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact centavos] | 67,604 and above | 25% |

**Note:** The exempt base **L217,493.16** is also the legal FY2025 filing threshold cited by SAR. The two upper 2025 thresholds come from a secondary SAR/Bloomberg summary and are rounded — confirm exact centavos from the SAR 2025 comunicado PDF before filing a FY2025 return.

### Surtaxes, Minimum Tax and Capital Gains

| Item | Rate / threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Solidarity Contribution (Aportación Solidaria) | 5% surtax on net taxable income **exceeding L1,000,000** | Decreto 278-2013 |
| Alternative Minimum Tax (high earners) | 1.5% of **gross income** for domiciled individuals with gross income **≥ L10,000,000**, when it exceeds progressive ISR otherwise due | PwC |
| Capital gains | Flat **10%** | PwC |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residence/domicile status | STOP — do not apply the resident progressive table without confirming domicile |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown income source (Honduran vs foreign) | Treat as Honduran-source (taxable) pending confirmation |
| Pure salaried employee with PAYE withholding | Assume no separate filing obligation unless other income exists |
| Income ≥ L10,000,000 gross | Flag alternative minimum tax for reviewer |
| Net taxable income > L1,000,000 | Flag solidarity contribution |

---

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residence/domicile status and whether the client is purely salaried (PAYE) or has self-employment / professional / rental / investment income.

**Recommended** — all sales invoices and fiscal receipts (facturas), purchase invoices/receipts, IHSS/RAP contribution records, prior year Declaración Jurada or SAR assessment, RTN (Registro Tributario Nacional), Pagos a Cuenta payment confirmations.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account, asset register, employer salary certificate (constancia de sueldo), evidence of any solidarity-contribution advance instalments paid.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This ISR computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid fiscal documentation (facturas with RTN) and that income is correctly classified as Honduran-source."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-HN-1 — Residence/domicile unknown.** "Honduras taxes residents and non-residents differently; non-residents bear final withholding at flat rates and generally do not file the progressive return. This skill cannot compute ISR without confirming domicile. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-HN-2 — Companies / legal persons.** "This skill covers individuals (personas naturales) only. Legal persons (personas jurídicas) file Form 103 with Activo Neto and Aportación Solidaria, and face the corporate ISR regime. Escalate to a Honduran-licensed accountant."

**R-HN-3 — Special regimes.** "Export, free-zone (Zona Libre/maquila), tourism, and other special regimes have bespoke rules and exemptions. Out of scope. Escalate to a Honduran-licensed accountant."

**R-HN-4 — Capital gains / property disposals.** "Capital gains are taxed at a flat 10% and require specialised computation of basis and proceeds. Out of scope for the progressive-income workflow. Escalate to a Honduran-licensed accountant."

**R-HN-5 — Arrears / SAR enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to SAR enforcement. Penalties and surcharges under Código Tributario Art. 160 apply. Do not advise. Escalate to a Honduran-licensed accountant immediately."

**R-HN-6 — Sales tax (ISV/VAT) requested.** "This skill covers income tax (ISR) only. Honduras sales tax (ISV) is a separate 15% (18% on certain premium services) regime — escalate to the appropriate ISV skill or a licensed accountant."

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Honduran statements are typically in Spanish. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/description as it appears in the statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Créditos)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Client name + TRANSFERENCIA, DEPOSITO, ABONO, PAGO RECIBIDO | Business / professional income | Renta gravable; if ISV-registered, extract net of 15% ISV |
| HONORARIOS, SERVICIOS PROFESIONALES, CONSULTORIA | Business / professional income | Professional fees — typical for self-employed |
| COMISION, COMISIONES | Business income | Commissions are taxable |
| STRIPE PAYOUT, PAYPAL, WISE, PAYONEER | Business income | Platform payout — match to underlying invoices |
| UPWORK, FIVERR, FREELANCER | Business income | Freelance platform — net of platform commission |
| SUELDO, SALARIO, PLANILLA, NOMINA, [employer name] | Employment income | PAYE-withheld; generally not in the self-employment base |
| ALQUILER, RENTA RECIBIDA, ARRENDAMIENTO | Rental income | Taxable income, separate source |
| INTERESES RECIBIDOS, INTERES | Investment income | Interest income (resident WHT 10% may apply) |
| DIVIDENDOS | Investment income | Dividends (WHT 10%) |
| DEVOLUCION SAR, REINTEGRO ISR | EXCLUDE | Tax refund — not income |
| BONO GOBIERNO, SUBSIDIO (capital) | EXCLUDE unless revenue subsidy | Capital grants EXCLUDE; revenue subsidies = income |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits / Débitos) — Deductible

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ALQUILER OFICINA, RENTA LOCAL | Office rent | Deductible | Dedicated business premises; needs factura with RTN |
| CONTADOR, AUDITOR, CONTABILIDAD | Accountancy fees | Deductible | Business-related |
| ABOGADO, NOTARIO, LEGAL (negocio) | Legal fees | Deductible | Must be business-related |
| PAPELERIA, UTILES DE OFICINA | Office supplies | Deductible | |

| INTERNET, TIGO, CLARO, HONDUTEL (negocio) | Telecoms/broadband | Deductible (business %) | Apportion if mixed; default 0% if personal line |

### 3.3 Statutory Deductions / Contributions

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IHSS, SEGURO SOCIAL, COTIZACION IHSS | Statutory deduction | Employee EM+IVM contributions — see Section 5 |
| RAP, APORTACION RAP, REGIMEN APORTACIONES PRIVADAS | Statutory deduction | Mandatory private pension/severance — see Section 5 |
| INFOP | Employer-only levy | 1% employer only — NOT an employee deduction [PwC] |
| IMPUESTO VECINAL, IMPUESTO PERSONAL MUNICIPAL | Municipal tax | Withheld by employers with 5+ workers, graduated 1.50–5.25 per thousand of gross [PwC] |

### 3.4 Expense Patterns — NOT Deductible

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RESTAURANTE, CENA, ALMUERZO, ENTRETENIMIENTO | NOT deductible | Personal/entertainment — flag any business-meal claim for reviewer |
| SUPERMERCADO, LA COLONIA, WALMART, DESPENSA | NOT deductible | Private living costs |
| MULTA, SANCION, RECARGO, MORA | NOT deductible | Fines/penalties — public policy |
| PAGO ISR, IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA | NOT deductible | Income tax cannot reduce its own base |
| RETIRO PERSONAL, CAJERO (personal), GASTOS PERSONALES | NOT deductible | Drawings / private withdrawals |

### 3.5 Exclusions (Neither Income nor Expense)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TRANSFERENCIA PROPIA, ENTRE CUENTAS PROPIAS | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| PRESTAMO, ABONO PRESTAMO, CAPITAL PRESTAMO | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |

### 3.6 Honduran Banks — Statement Format Reference

| Bank | Common Patterns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Banco Atlántida | TRANSFERENCIA, ABONO, CARGO, COMISION | PDF/CSV; date DD/MM/YYYY |

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

All figures in Honduran Lempira (HNL / "L"). Statement lines are illustrative.

### Example 1 — Professional fee received (self-employed)

**Input line:**
`12/03/2026 ; BAC TRANSFERENCIA RECIBIDA ; CONSTRUCTORA MAYA SA ; PAGO HONORARIOS FAC-0042 ; +34,500.00 ; HNL`

**Reasoning:**
Professional fee for services. Honduran-source, taxable. If the client is ISV-registered and the L34,500 includes 15% ISV, the net is L34,500 / 1.15 = L30,000 (ISV L4,500 is a liability to SAR, excluded from the income-tax base). Assume here the client is NOT ISV-registered, so the full L34,500 is gross income.

**Classification:** Renta gravable = L34,500.00 (or L30,000.00 net if ISV-registered).

### Example 2 — Software subscription (deductible)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2026 ; FICOHSA CARGO ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD ABR ; -780.00 ; HNL`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly recurring SaaS subscription used for the business. Fully deductible operating expense, provided a valid factura with the client's RTN is retained.

**Classification:** Deductible expense = L780.00.

### Example 3 — IHSS + RAP employee contributions (statutory deduction)

**Input line (monthly salary at the contribution ceiling):**
`30/04/2026 ; ATLANTIDA PLANILLA ; COTIZACION IHSS + RAP ; ABR 2026 ; -773.70 ; HNL`

**Reasoning:**
Employee social-security burden on a salary at or above the 2025 ceiling of **L11,903.13/month**: EM 2.5% + IVM 2.5% + RAP 1.5% = **6.5%** combined employee share. [El Heraldo; Dinero HN; RAP comunicado 2025]

Computation: L11,903.13 × 6.5% = L773.70 (11,903.13 × 0.065 = 773.70345, rounded to L773.70).

**Classification:** Statutory employee contribution = L773.70 for the month. [RESEARCH GAP — confirm 2026 IHSS/RAP ceiling; only the 2025 ceiling of L11,903.13 is authoritatively confirmed.]

### Example 4 — Solidarity contribution (high net income)

**Input:**
Self-employed individual, FY2026, net taxable income (renta neta gravable) = **L1,400,000**.

**Reasoning:**
The solidarity contribution (Aportación Solidaria, Decreto 278-2013) is 5% on the portion of net taxable income exceeding L1,000,000. It is NOT deductible from ISR and is settled separately.

Computation: (1,400,000 − 1,000,000) × 5% = 400,000 × 0.05 = **L20,000.00**.

This is in addition to the progressive ISR on the full L1,400,000.

**Classification:** Solidarity contribution = L20,000.00 (separate line from progressive ISR).

### Example 5 — Drawings (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2026 ; OCCIDENTE TRANSFERENCIA ; CUENTA PROPIA AHORRO ; ; -25,000.00 ; HNL`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

### Example 6 — Pago a Cuenta (advance ISR payment)

**Input line:**
`30/06/2026 ; BAC PAGO SAR ; PAGO A CUENTA ISR ; 1ER ANTICIPO ; -18,000.00 ; HNL`

**Reasoning:**
Advance income-tax instalment (Pago a Cuenta). Not an expense — it is a credit against the final annual ISR liability, settled with the Declaración Jurada on 30 April.

**Classification:** Credit against ISR = L18,000.00. NOT a deduction.

---

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Territorial Scope

**Legislation:** Ley del ISR. Honduras taxes on a **territorial basis** — only Honduran-source income is taxable for both residents and non-residents. [PwC] Foreign-source income of residents is generally outside scope; confirm source before including any item.

### 5.2 Progressive ISR — Resident Individuals

Apply the 2026 progressive table (Section 1) to annual **net taxable income** (renta neta gravable = gross taxable income less allowable deductions and the exempt base). The table is re-indexed annually by SAR. [SAR Comunicado 02-2026] Cumulative-tax figures are pre-derived in Section 1 — pass the chargeable base to the deterministic engine rather than computing band tax by hand.

### 5.3 Solidarity Contribution

**Legislation:** Decreto 278-2013. A **5%** surtax on net taxable income exceeding **L1,000,000**. Not deductible from ISR. Paid via three quarterly advance instalments (30 Jun, 30 Sep, 31 Dec) and settled with the annual return on 30 April. Excludes special export/tourism regimes.

### 5.4 Alternative Minimum Tax

**Legislation / source:** PwC. Domiciled individuals with **gross income ≥ L10,000,000** pay the greater of progressive ISR or **1.5% of gross income**. Flag any client at or above this threshold for reviewer.

### 5.5 Capital Gains

Flat **10%** on the gain. [PwC] Out of scope for the progressive workflow — see R-HN-4.

### 5.6 Deductibility — General Test

Expenses are deductible only if ordinary, necessary, and incurred to produce or maintain Honduran-source taxable income, and supported by a valid **factura** bearing the supplier's RTN. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis.

### 5.7 Non-Deductible Items

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Entertainment / personal meals | Private consumption |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines, penalties, surcharges (multas/recargos) | Public policy |
| Income tax (ISR) itself | Tax on income |
| Solidarity contribution | Expressly non-deductible from ISR |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |

### 5.8 Social Security & Payroll Contributions (2025 reform)

**Legislation:** Ley del Sistema Integral de Protección Social (approved 30 Apr 2024); new rates effective Jan 2025. Administered by **IHSS** (Instituto Hondureño de Seguridad Social) and **RAP** (Régimen de Aportaciones Privadas). Applied on salary up to the **2025 monthly ceiling of L11,903.13** (unified for EM and IVM; also the RAP piso/techo de cotización). [El Heraldo; Dinero HN; RAP comunicado 2025]

| Regime | Employee | Employer | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| EM (Enfermedad y Maternidad — health/maternity) | 2.5% | 5.0% | — |
| IVM (Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte — pensions) | 2.5% | 3.5% | 0.5% |
| RAP (Régimen de Aportaciones Privadas) | 1.5% | 1.5% | — |
| **TOTAL** | **6.5%** | **10.0%** | **0.5%** |

**Totals verification (recomputed):** Employee 2.5 + 2.5 + 1.5 = **6.5%** ✓; Employer 5.0 + 3.5 + 1.5 = **10.0%** ✓; State 0.5% on IVM only.

**Employer-only:** INFOP (training fund) **1%** of payroll, no employee portion. [PwC]

**Caveat:** PwC's "other taxes" page lists pre-reform IHSS ceilings (L11,109 EM / L11,336 IVM) and a 1% employee IVM rate. The 2025 reform figures above (2.5% employee IVM, unified L11,903.13 ceiling) supersede them. [RESEARCH GAP — confirm 2026 IHSS/RAP ceiling directly with IHSS/RAP; only the 2025 ceiling is confirmed.]

### 5.9 Non-Resident Withholding (Honduran-source income)

**Source:** PwC, withholding taxes. Final withholding for non-residents:

| Payment type | WHT rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends | 10% |
| Interest (commercial ops, bonds, securities) | 10% |
| Royalties (incl. mining/natural resources) | 25% |
| Salaries/fees for services (in or outside HN) | 25% |
| Any other income not specified | 10% |

Honduras has **no double-tax treaties** (only TIEAs with the US and some Central American countries). [PwC]

### 5.10 Filing, Forms & Deadlines

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tax year | Calendar year ending 31 December | PwC |
| Annual return | Declaración Jurada del ISR — Persona Natural, Form 102 / 102-1, via DET Live | SAR DET Live |
| Filing & payment deadline | 30 April of the following year | Radio HRN; PwC |
| Who must file | Individuals with annual net income exceeding the exempt base (L217,493.16 for FY2025); self-employed earning fees, commissions, royalties, service income, interest or rental income | Radio HRN; PwC |
| Pure salaried employees | ISR withheld monthly via PAYE; generally need not file unless other income exists | PwC |
| Suspension | If below the exempt base but previously filed, file a Notification of Suspension before 30 Apr | Radio HRN |
| Advance payments | Pagos a Cuenta paid in instalments during the year, settled with the annual return | PwC; SAR |
| RTN | Registro Tributario Nacional required to file and operate | SAR |

### 5.11 Penalties

Late filing of the Declaración Jurada is subject to fines and surcharges under **Article 160 of the Código Tributario (Decreto 170-2016)**. [Radio HRN] **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact graduated lempira fine/surcharge schedule directly from Decreto 170-2016 Art. 160 before advising on penalty amounts.

## Section 6 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction
- Calculate the business-use proportion of the home (dedicated room as % of total floor area).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity, water, internet, maintenance.
- Must be a genuinely dedicated workspace; dual-use rooms do not qualify.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the arrangement.

### 6.2 Vehicle Business Use
- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and maintenance is deductible.
- Client must keep a usage log (business vs total km).
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a log is provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use
- Business-use portion only; client must provide a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Source of Income (Honduran vs Foreign)
- Territorial system: only Honduran-source income is taxable.
- For platform/foreign-client receipts, the source can be ambiguous — flag for reviewer to confirm where the service was rendered/used.
- **Conservative default:** treat as Honduran-source (taxable) pending confirmation.

### 6.5 Bad Debt Write-Off
- Deductible only if the income was previously declared, recovery steps were taken, and the debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag all three for reviewer.

### 6.6 ISV (Sales Tax) Interaction
- ISV collected on sales (15%, or 18% on premium services) is a liability to SAR, not income; input ISV recovered is not an expense for ISR-registered taxpayers.
- For non-ISV-registered individuals, ISV paid on purchases forms part of the gross cost.
- Flag ISV registration status for reviewer.

### 6.7 Alternative Minimum Tax / Solidarity Contribution Application
- Flag any client with gross income ≥ L10,000,000 (AMT) or net taxable income > L1,000,000 (solidarity contribution) for reviewer confirmation of the additional charge.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Exempt salaried individual (2026).**
Input: Resident, annual net income L210,000, purely salaried, PAYE withheld.
Expected: Below 2026 exempt base of L228,324.32 → ISR = L0. Generally no filing obligation (may file Notification of Suspension if previously filed).

**Test 2 — Mid-range self-employed (2026).**
Input: Resident self-employed, net taxable income L500,000.
Expected: Band 2 fully (L17,974.47) + Band 3 portion: (500,000 − 348,154.10) × 20% = 151,845.90 × 0.20 = L30,369.18. Total ISR = 17,974.47 + 30,369.18 = **L48,343.65**. No solidarity contribution (net < L1,000,000).

**Test 3 — Top-band with solidarity contribution (2026).**
Input: Resident self-employed, net taxable income L1,400,000.
Expected: ISR = cumulative at L809,660.76 (L110,275.80) + (1,400,000 − 809,660.75) × 25% = 590,339.25 × 0.25 = L147,584.81; total ISR = 110,275.80 + 147,584.81 = **L257,860.61**. Plus solidarity contribution (1,400,000 − 1,000,000) × 5% = **L20,000.00** (separate, non-deductible).

**Test 4 — Employee social security at ceiling (2025).**
Input: Monthly salary ≥ L11,903.13.
Expected: Employee contributions = 6.5% × L11,903.13 = **L773.70/month** (EM 2.5% + IVM 2.5% + RAP 1.5%).

**Test 5 — Alternative minimum tax flag.**
Input: Domiciled individual, gross income L12,000,000, progressive ISR computed at L150,000.
Expected: AMT = 1.5% × 12,000,000 = L180,000 > L150,000 → AMT applies; tax = **L180,000**.

**Test 6 — Drawings excluded.**
Input: L25,000 own-account transfer recorded as expense.
Expected: EXCLUDE. Not an expense, not income.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the resident progressive table without confirming residence/domicile.
- NEVER compute band tax by hand for filing — pass net taxable income to the deterministic engine.
- NEVER deduct entertainment or personal living expenses.
- NEVER deduct the ISR or the solidarity contribution itself.
- NEVER deduct fines, penalties, or surcharges (multas/recargos).
- NEVER include ISV collected on sales in the income-tax base for ISV-registered clients.
- NEVER treat a Pago a Cuenta as an expense — it is a credit against the final liability.
- NEVER claim a deduction without a valid factura bearing the supplier's RTN.
- NEVER apply foreign-source income to the Honduran base without confirming source (territorial system).
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and flag the marked RESEARCH GAPs.
