## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (ISR — Impuesto Sobre la Renta)

Honduras **does** levy personal income tax on employees. The employer is the
**withholding agent (agente de retención)**: it deducts ISR monthly from payroll and
remits it monthly to SAR (PwC — Tax administration). The progressive table
(*tabla progresiva*) is updated annually by SAR for inflation and is expressed on
**annual Renta Neta Gravable** (taxable net income). Rates: **0% / 15% / 20% / 25%**.

### ISR Progressive Table — Fiscal Year 2025 (CONFIRMED)

Source: Bloomberg Línea (full table); KPMG TaxNewsFlash Honduras Jan 2025; Galindo & Asociados; Auxadi.
2025 brackets adjusted using a 3.88% inflation figure (Banco Central de Honduras). Exempt threshold rose from L209,369.62 (2024) to L217,493.16 (2025).

| Annual taxable income (L) | Approx. monthly (L) | Marginal rate | Tax on this bracket (cumulative at top) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0.01 – 217,493.16 | 0.01 – 21,457.76 | **0% (exento)** | L0.00 |
| 217,493.17 – 331,638.50 | 21,457.77 – 30,969.88 | **15%** | L17,121.80 |
| 331,638.51 – 771,252.38 | 30,969.89 – 67,604.36 | **20%** | L105,044.57 |
| 771,252.39 and above | 67,604.37+ | **25%** | — |

**Subtract-method constants (2025)** — `tax = (annual taxable income × rate) − subtract`:

| Band | Rate | Subtract (L) |
|---|---|---|
| 217,493.17 – 331,638.50 | 15% | 32,623.97 |
| 331,638.51 – 771,252.38 | 20% | 49,205.89 |
| 771,252.39+ | 25% | 87,768.51 |

*Continuity check:* at L331,638.50 → 0.15 × 331,638.50 − 32,623.97 = **L17,121.80**;
at L771,252.38 → 0.20 × 771,252.38 − 49,205.89 = **L105,044.57**. Both bands tie out.

### ISR Progressive Table — Fiscal Year 2026 (CONFIRMED, SAR-published)

Source: SAR — *Actualización de la Tabla Progresiva 2026*; figures transcribed by Auxadi (Feb 2026).

| Annual taxable income (L) | Approx. monthly (L) | Marginal rate |
|---|---|---|
| 0.01 – 228,324.32 | 0.01 – 22,360.36 | **0% (exento)** |
| 228,324.33 – 348,154.10 | 22,360.37 – 32,346.18 | **15%** |
| 348,154.11 – 809,660.75 | 32,346.19 – 70,805.06 | **20%** |
| 809,660.76 and above | 70,805.07+ | **25%** |

**Subtract-method constants (2026)** — derived from the published brackets:

| Band | Rate | Subtract (L) |
|---|---|---|
| 228,324.33 – 348,154.10 | 15% | 34,248.65 |
| 348,154.11 – 809,660.75 | 20% | 51,664.06 |
| 809,660.76+ | 25% | 92,130.10 |

*Continuity check:* at L348,154.10 → 0.15 × 348,154.10 − 34,248.65 = **L17,974.47**;
0.20 × 348,154.10 − 51,664.06 = **L17,966.76**. (~L7.71 rounding drift from the
published bracket edges — acceptable for estimation; the precise SAR-published constants
should be used in production. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact 2026 subtract constants]**.)

### Deductions before taxable net income

| Deduction | Amount | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medical/educational expense deduction | **L40,000 flat per year** | Subtracted from gross before arriving at Renta Neta Gravable. The "approx. monthly" columns above EXCLUDE this L40,000. | Bloomberg Línea; Galindo & Asociados |
| IHSS + RAP employee contributions | Actual | Mandatory contributions reduce taxable base in practice. | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm deductibility/ordering against ISR law]** |

### Withholding mechanism

- ISR is **withheld monthly by the employer** from payroll and remitted monthly to SAR (PwC — Tax administration).
- Pure-salary employees whose tax is fully withheld generally **do not file** an annual return;
  those with fees, commissions, royalties, rental, or interest income **must file** Form 102 (PwC — Tax administration).

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- IHSS (Employee + Employer)

IHSS runs two contributory regimes plus occupational-risk cover. For 2025 both EM and IVM
are capped at a monthly **contribution ceiling (techo de cotización) of L11,903.13**
(Dinero HN — *IHSS oficializa techo 2025*). The ceiling rises gradually with minimum-wage
adjustments; rate percentages did not change for 2025.

### IHSS Contribution Rates (2025)

| Regime | Employee | Employer | State | Monthly ceiling (2025) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **EM** (Enfermedad y Maternidad — sickness/maternity) | **2.5%** | **5.0%** | 0.5% | L11,903.13 |
| **IVM** (Invalidez, Vejez y Muerte — disability/old-age/death) | **2.5%**\* | **3.5%** | 0.5% | L11,903.13 |
| **Riesgo Profesional** (occupational risk) | 0% | **0.2%** (range 0.2%–3.4% by risk class) | — | salary (no ceiling cited) |

Sources: ceiling + IVM split — Dinero HN; EM/IVM employer/employee splits — Mismo (Honduras Payroll Guide).

**Column totals (employee side, EM + IVM, at/above ceiling):** 2.5% + 2.5% = **5.0%**.
**Column totals (employer side, EM + IVM + min. occupational risk):** 5.0% + 3.5% + 0.2% = **8.7%**
(8.5% without occupational risk; occupational risk varies by risk class).

> \***[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** IHSS/Dinero HN report the IVM **employee** rate
> as **2.5%**; PwC (Other taxes) reports **1.0%** and shows older ceilings (L11,109.36 / L11,336.00).
> This skill uses the IHSS-published 2.5% and the L11,903.13 ceiling as the default. The IVM
> employee percentage and the EM/IVM employer percentages must be reconciled against the current
> IHSS resolution before any output is finalized.

**Monthly L-amounts at the 2025 ceiling (L11,903.13):**

| Regime | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| EM | 2.5% × 11,903.13 = **L297.58** | 5.0% × 11,903.13 = **L595.16** |
| IVM | 2.5% × 11,903.13 = **L297.58** | 3.5% × 11,903.13 = **L416.61** |
| Occupational risk (0.2%) | — | 0.2% × 11,903.13 = **L23.81** |
| **Total IHSS at ceiling** | **L595.16** | **L1,035.58** |

*Check:* employee 297.58 + 297.58 = 595.16. Employer 595.16 + 416.61 + 23.81 = 1,035.58. Tie out.

---

## Section 4 -- Private Contributions -- RAP (Régimen de Aportaciones Privadas)

Reformed by **Decreto 47-2024**, splitting RAP into two obligations (Mismo — Honduras Payroll Guide):

| Component | Employee | Employer | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Fondo de Reserva Laboral** (reserve labor fund — severance/seniority) | 0% | **4.0%** | Ordinary monthly salary, capped at **3× the highest minimum wage** |
| **Ahorro sobre el techo IHSS** (savings above the IHSS ceiling) | **1.5%** | **1.5%** | Only the portion of salary **exceeding** the L11,903.13 IHSS ceiling |

- The Fondo de Reserva Laboral is **employer-only** and replaces the legacy severance reserve.
- The above-ceiling savings (1.5% + 1.5%) apply ONLY to the salary slice above L11,903.13/month.
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** PwC describes the legacy "RAP 1.5%" as **optional**
  post-reform. Confirm mandatory vs optional treatment under Decreto 47-2024 before finalizing.

---

## Section 5 -- INFOP Training Levy

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Rate | **1% of total accrued monthly payroll** | PwC — Other taxes; Mismo |
| Who pays | **Employer-only** | PwC; Mismo |
| Applicability threshold | Commonly cited as **5+ employees** | Mismo — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm threshold against INFOP law]** |
| Payment deadline | Within **10 business days after month-end** | Mismo |

---

## Section 6 -- 13th & 14th Month Salary (Aguinaldo / Catorceavo)

Both are statutory and, under Honduran labor law, **fully exempt from ISR and from
IHSS/RAP deductions** (legal basis: Reglamento del Décimo Cuarto Mes, Acuerdo 02-95).

| Item | Amount | Paid | Calculation | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **13th month** (Aguinaldo / Décimo Tercer Mes) | One month's salary | **December** | Sum of fixed monthly salary Jan–Dec ÷ 12 | Finiquito Justo — Aguinaldo |
| **14th month** (Décimo Cuarto Mes / Catorceavo) | One month's salary | **June (deadline 30 June)** | Ordinary salaries 1 Jul (prior yr) – 30 Jun ÷ 12 | Finiquito Justo — Décimo Cuarto; Acuerdo 02-95 |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Some secondary guides claim the 13th/14th are
> exempt only "up to 10× minimum wage." The labor regulation and Honduran labor-rights guidance
> treat them as **fully exempt**; this skill uses full exemption as the authoritative default.
> Flag the 10× cap as unverified against primary law (Reglamento + ISR law).

---

## Section 7 -- Minimum Wage

Honduras sets minimum wage by **sector and company size** (12 economic activities), not a
single national figure. The maquila/textile free-zone sector has a single uniform wage.

### 2025 (CONFIRMED in effect)

| Item | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Legal basis | Acuerdo Ejecutivo STSS/SETRASS-109-2024, La Gaceta 21 Mar 2024 | EY; Secretaría de Trabajo |
| Average minimum wage 2025 | **~L13,985.16/month** | EY; Secretaría de Trabajo |
| Maquila (textile/free zones) 2025 | **L11,972.29/month** | EY; SETRASS Acuerdo 109-2024 |

Lowest-sector wages (agriculture, small business) are materially below the average.

### 2026 (PARTIAL / provisional)

| Item | Amount | Source / status |
|---|---|---|
| Maquila 2026 | **L12,930.07/month** (+8%) | SETRASS Acuerdo 109-2024 (firm) |
| Average minimum wage 2026 | **L14,917.20/month** (≈L62.16/hr, +L932.04) | El Heraldo / La Prensa, **press only — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Acuerdo 233-2026 on official trabajo.gob.hn table]** |
| 2026 sector range | ~L9,596.64 (agriculture, small co.) up to L13,654.55–L19,298.72 (financial/insurance/real-estate) | La Prensa, **[RESEARCH GAP]** |

> For production, use the **2025 official table (Acuerdo 109-2024)** as the firm baseline and
> treat 2026 general-sector figures as provisional until confirmed on the official table.

## Section 8 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative** assumption (the one that does
NOT understate withholding/contributions) and FLAG it for the reviewer.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Employee birth year / IVM rate split | Use **IVM employee 2.5%** (IHSS-published) | Higher than PwC's 1.0%; avoids under-withholding. Flag for reconciliation. |
| Occupational-risk class | Use **0.2%** (lowest band) for employer cost ONLY if class unknown, but FLAG | Avoids over-stating cost; but note range to 3.4% |
| Whether salary exceeds IHSS ceiling | Compute IHSS on **min(salary, L11,903.13)** | Ceiling is statutory |
| RAP above-ceiling savings | Apply 1.5% + 1.5% on the **excess over L11,903.13** | Mandatory per Decreto 47-2024 (pending optional-status flag) |
| INFOP applicability | Apply **1%** if employer has 5+ employees; FLAG if headcount unknown | Threshold unconfirmed |
| Medical deduction | Apply **L40,000** only if substantiated; otherwise omit | Deduction requires support |
| 13th/14th month taxability | Treat as **fully ISR/IHSS/RAP-exempt** | Labor-law default |
| Tax year | Default to **2025** table unless date ≥ 1 Jan 2026 | Skill tax_year is 2025 |
| Currency | Lempira (HNL) | Foreign-currency wage payment is prohibited |

---

## Section 9 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing payroll

1. Gross monthly salary in Lempiras (and whether it is fixed/ordinary).
2. Pay frequency (weekly/monthly) and worker class (manual vs office/intellectual).
3. Number of employees on the planilla (for INFOP applicability).
4. Tax/fiscal year (2025 vs 2026 ISR table).
5. Whether the L40,000 medical deduction is substantiated.
6. Occupational-risk class (for employer cost) where available.
7. Confirmation of any non-ordinary pay components (overtime, commissions, bonuses).

### Refusal catalogue — DO NOT compute, refuse and request input

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No gross salary provided | REFUSE — request salary in Lempiras |
| Salary stated in USD/EUR with no HNL conversion and no rate | REFUSE — wages are legally paid in Lempiras; request HNL figure |
| Request to pay wages in foreign currency | REFUSE — prohibited under the Labor Code |
| Request to omit ISR withholding or IHSS/RAP/INFOP to "save money" | REFUSE — these are statutory; escalate to accountant |
| Request to treat 13th/14th month as taxable to inflate withholding | REFUSE — statutorily exempt; flag |
| Self-employed / fee / rental / royalty income mixed in | REFUSE payroll path — route to a Honduras income-tax skill (Form 102) |
| Definitive "this is your exact tax" assertion requested | REFUSE — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |

---

## Section 10 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Classify bank-statement lines deterministically. Match case-insensitively; longest/most-specific
pattern wins.

### Salary credits (money arriving in an employee account)

| Pattern (regex-ish, case-insensitive) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SALARIO`, `PAGO PLANILLA`, `NOMINA`, `SUELDO` | Net salary payment |
| `TRANSF.* [empresa]`, `ABONO SALARIO` | Net salary payment |
| `AGUINALDO`, `DECIMO TERCER`, `13.* MES` | 13th month (ISR-exempt) |
| `CATORCEAVO`, `DECIMO CUARTO`, `14.* MES` | 14th month (ISR-exempt) |
| `REINTEGRO IHSS`, `DEVOLUCION IHSS` | IHSS refund/adjustment — not income |

### Employer debits (money leaving the employer account)

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SAR`, `RETENCION ISR`, `ISR PLANILLA`, `DET LIVE` | ISR withholding remitted to SAR (liability settlement) |
| `IHSS`, `PLANILLA IHSS`, `SEGURO SOCIAL` | IHSS contribution (employer + employee portions) |
| `RAP`, `APORTACIONES PRIVADAS`, `FONDO RESERVA` | RAP contribution |
| `INFOP` | INFOP 1% training levy |
| `PAGO NOMINA`, `PLANILLA SALARIOS`, `DISPERSION` | Net wages disbursed to employees |

## Section 11 -- Worked Examples

> All figures use the **2025** ISR table and the L11,903.13 IHSS ceiling. IHSS IVM employee rate
> = 2.5% (IHSS-published default; pending PwC reconciliation). Amounts rounded to the cent.

### Example 1 — Low earner, below exempt threshold

**Inputs:** Fixed salary L18,000/month → annual gross L216,000. No medical deduction claimed.

- Annual gross L216,000 < L217,493.16 exempt threshold → **ISR = L0.00**.
- IHSS base = min(18,000, 11,903.13) = 11,903.13.
  - Employee EM 2.5% = L297.58; IVM 2.5% = L297.58 → **employee IHSS L595.16**.
- RAP: salary 18,000 > ceiling 11,903.13 → above-ceiling slice = 18,000 − 11,903.13 = L6,096.87.
  - Employee RAP 1.5% × 6,096.87 = **L91.45**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 595.16 + 91.45 = **L686.61**.
- **Net pay** = 18,000.00 − 0.00 − 686.61 = **L17,313.39**.

*Bank line example:* `PAGO PLANILLA — JUNIO` credit **L17,313.39**.

### Example 2 — Mid earner, into the 15% ISR band

**Inputs:** Fixed salary L28,000/month → annual gross L336,000. L40,000 medical deduction substantiated.

- Annual taxable net = 336,000 − 40,000 = **L296,000** (falls in the 15% band: 217,493.17–331,638.50).
- ISR (annual) = 0.15 × 296,000 − 32,623.97 = 44,400.00 − 32,623.97 = **L11,776.03/year**.
- Monthly ISR withholding ≈ 11,776.03 ÷ 12 = **L981.34**.
- IHSS base = ceiling 11,903.13 → employee EM 297.58 + IVM 297.58 = **L595.16**.
- RAP above-ceiling: (28,000 − 11,903.13) × 1.5% = 16,096.87 × 1.5% = **L241.45**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 981.34 + 595.16 + 241.45 = **L1,817.95**.
- **Net pay** = 28,000.00 − 1,817.95 = **L26,182.05**.

### Example 3 — Higher earner, into the 20% ISR band

**Inputs:** Fixed salary L50,000/month → annual gross L600,000. L40,000 medical deduction substantiated.

- Annual taxable net = 600,000 − 40,000 = **L560,000** (20% band: 331,638.51–771,252.38).
- ISR (annual) = 0.20 × 560,000 − 49,205.89 = 112,000.00 − 49,205.89 = **L62,794.11/year**.
- Monthly ISR ≈ 62,794.11 ÷ 12 = **L5,232.84**.
- IHSS employee at ceiling = **L595.16**.
- RAP above-ceiling: (50,000 − 11,903.13) × 1.5% = 38,096.87 × 1.5% = **L571.45**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 5,232.84 + 595.16 + 571.45 = **L6,399.45**.
- **Net pay** = 50,000.00 − 6,399.45 = **L43,600.55**.

### Example 4 — Top-band earner (25% ISR)

**Inputs:** Fixed salary L90,000/month → annual gross L1,080,000. L40,000 medical deduction.

- Annual taxable net = 1,080,000 − 40,000 = **L1,040,000** (25% band: ≥771,252.39).
- ISR (annual) = 0.25 × 1,040,000 − 87,768.51 = 260,000.00 − 87,768.51 = **L172,231.49/year**.
- Monthly ISR ≈ 172,231.49 ÷ 12 = **L14,352.62**.
- IHSS employee at ceiling = **L595.16**.
- RAP above-ceiling: (90,000 − 11,903.13) × 1.5% = 78,096.87 × 1.5% = **L1,171.45**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 14,352.62 + 595.16 + 1,171.45 = **L16,119.23**.
- **Net pay** = 90,000.00 − 16,119.23 = **L73,880.77**.

### Example 5 — Employer total cost of a mid earner (L28,000/month)

Building on Example 2 (salary L28,000/month):

| Employer cost item | Computation | Amount (L) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross salary | — | 28,000.00 |
| IHSS EM 5.0% (on ceiling) | 5.0% × 11,903.13 | 595.16 |
| IHSS IVM 3.5% (on ceiling) | 3.5% × 11,903.13 | 416.61 |
| IHSS occupational risk 0.2% | 0.2% × 11,903.13 | 23.81 |
| RAP reserve fund 4.0% | 4.0% × 28,000.00 (within 3× max-min-wage cap) | 1,120.00 |
| RAP above-ceiling 1.5% (employer) | 1.5% × (28,000 − 11,903.13) | 241.45 |
| INFOP 1.0% (if 5+ employees) | 1.0% × 28,000.00 | 280.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | sum | **30,677.03** |

*Check:* 28,000 + 595.16 + 416.61 + 23.81 + 1,120.00 + 241.45 + 280.00 = **30,677.03**. Tie out.
(Employer-on-top burden = L2,677.03 = ~9.56% of gross at this salary.)

### Example 6 — 13th month (aguinaldo), December

**Inputs:** Fixed salary L28,000/month, full year worked.

- Aguinaldo = sum(Jan–Dec salary) ÷ 12 = (28,000 × 12) ÷ 12 = **L28,000.00**.
- ISR on aguinaldo = **L0.00** (statutorily exempt).
- IHSS/RAP on aguinaldo = **L0.00** (exempt).
- **Net aguinaldo = L28,000.00** paid in December.

## Section 12 -- Tier 1 Rules (hard, non-negotiable)

1. ISR is **employer-withheld monthly** and remitted to SAR; never skip it for salaried staff (PwC).
2. Use the **annual Renta Neta Gravable** with the correct year's table; apply the subtract-method constants exactly.
3. IHSS EM and IVM are each capped at the **L11,903.13/month** ceiling (2025) (Dinero HN).
4. The **13th and 14th month** salaries are ISR/IHSS/RAP **exempt** by default (Acuerdo 02-95).
5. RAP reserve fund (4% employer) and INFOP (1% employer) are **employer-only**.

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data:

1. **No prior planilla available** → request the last 3 months of payroll registers and IHSS/RAP/SAR receipts to back-solve rates actually applied.
2. **Unknown headcount** → default INFOP off, FLAG; confirm before first remittance.
3. **Unknown employee birth years** → default IVM employee 2.5%, FLAG for reconciliation.
4. **Unknown sector/min-wage band** → use the 2025 average (L13,985.16) only as a sanity check, never as the contractual wage; obtain the employee's contract.
5. **Year ambiguity** → default 2025 table; switch to 2026 only for periods ≥ 1 Jan 2026.

## Section 17 -- Filing, Forms & Deadlines

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tax year | Calendar year ending 31 Dec | PwC — Tax administration |
| Annual ISR return (natural persons) | Due **30 April** (rolls to next business day). Form **102**, via SAR DET Live | SAR; SAR DET Live ISR_PN |

## Section 18 -- Penalties (late filing / late payment)

Governed by the **Código Tributario (Decreto 22-97 and reforms)** and the ISR/ISV laws.

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late-filed return | Fine (multa) + surcharge (recargo) + interest (interés) per the Tax Code. For ISV the cited rate is **5% of tax per month or fraction** of delay (Art. 11 ISV law); a comparable monthly surcharge applies to ISR. | SAR; Código Tributario |
| Late payment (mora) | Assessed tax payable within **10 days** of assessment; interest + surcharges accrue from the original due date. | Código Tributario; PwC |
| Escalation | Repeated/total or partial non-payment can become criminal **defraudación fiscal**. | Código Tributario |
| Statute of limitations | Generally **4–7 years**. | Código Tributario |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The exact **ISR-specific** late-filing multa percentage,
> monetary caps, and interest rate could NOT be cleanly extracted from the Código Tributario PDF.
> The 5%/month figure is documented for ISV; read the ISR figures directly from Decreto 22-97
> (consolidated) before relying on them.

## Section 21 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputes end-to-end. Expected values use the 2025 table and IVM employee 2.5%.

1. **Exempt earner.** Salary L18,000/mo (annual L216,000), no medical deduction.
   Expected: ISR = **L0.00**; employee IHSS = **L595.16**; employee RAP = **L91.45**;
   net = **L17,313.39**.
2. **15% band.** Salary L28,000/mo, L40,000 deduction. Taxable net **L296,000**;
   ISR annual **L11,776.03**; ISR monthly **L981.34**; net **L26,182.05**.
3. **20% band.** Salary L50,000/mo, L40,000 deduction. Taxable net **L560,000**;
   ISR annual **L62,794.11**; ISR monthly **L5,232.84**; net **L43,600.55**.
4. **25% band.** Salary L90,000/mo, L40,000 deduction. Taxable net **L1,040,000**;
   ISR annual **L172,231.49**; ISR monthly **L14,352.62**; net **L73,880.77**.
5. **Employer cost.** Salary L28,000/mo, 5+ employees. Total employer cost **L30,677.03**.
6. **Aguinaldo.** Salary L28,000/mo full year. 13th month = **L28,000.00**, ISR **L0.00**, net **L28,000.00**.
7. **Bracket continuity.** At L331,638.50 ISR = **L17,121.80**; at L771,252.38 ISR = **L105,044.57** (subtract constants tie out).
8. **IHSS ceiling.** Salary L11,903.13 or above → employee IHSS always **L595.16/mo** (EM 297.58 + IVM 297.58).
9. **Below threshold edge.** Annual taxable net L217,493.16 → ISR **L0.00**; L217,493.17 → ISR ≈ **L0.00002** (effectively zero at the cent).
10. **Currency refusal.** Salary stated in USD with no HNL conversion → REFUSE and request Lempira figure.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER skip ISR withholding for salaried employees — the employer is the legal withholding agent.
- NEVER apply ISR to the 13th or 14th month salary — they are statutorily exempt.
- NEVER apply IHSS EM/IVM contributions above the L11,903.13/month ceiling.
- NEVER omit the employer-only obligations: RAP reserve fund (4%) and INFOP (1%, 5+ employees).
- NEVER pay or compute wages in a foreign currency — Lempiras only.
- NEVER use PwC's 1.0% IVM employee rate without flagging the conflict with the IHSS-published 2.5%.
- NEVER present the 2026 general-sector minimum wage (Acuerdo 233-2026) as confirmed — it is press-only.
- NEVER state an exact ISR late-filing penalty — the precise figure is an unconfirmed research gap.
- NEVER miss the monthly IHSS/RAP/ISR remittance or the 10-business-day INFOP deadline.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Honduran accountant.
