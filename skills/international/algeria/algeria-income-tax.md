### Algeria DOES levy a personal income tax

Unlike several Gulf jurisdictions, Algeria operates a full personal income tax (IRG) with a progressive scale topping out at 35%, plus mandatory social contributions (CNAS for employees, CASNOS for the self-employed) and a turnover-based micro regime (IFU). Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Algeria-sourced income only. *(Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Algeria, Individual -- Taxes on personal income, reviewed 14 Jul 2025: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)*

### IRG Progressive Scale (2025) -- Annual Taxable Income

| Annual taxable income (DZD) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 240,000 | 0% | DZD 0 |
| 240,001 -- 480,000 | 23% | DZD 55,200 |
| 480,001 -- 960,000 | 27% | DZD 184,800 |
| 960,001 -- 1,920,000 | 30% | DZD 472,800 |
| 1,920,001 -- 3,840,000 | 33% | DZD 1,106,400 |
| > 3,840,000 | 35% | -- |

*(Source: PwC -- Algeria, Individual, reviewed 14 Jul 2025: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)*

**Cumulative tax derivation (arithmetic, recomputed):**
- 23% × 240,000 = 55,200
- 55,200 + (27% × 480,000 = 129,600) = 184,800
- 184,800 + (30% × 960,000 = 288,000) = 472,800
- 472,800 + (33% × 1,920,000 = 633,600) = 1,106,400

**Salary exemption:** monthly salaries ≤ DZD 30,000 are exempt from IRG. *(Source: PwC -- Income determination: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/income-determination)*

| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, premises) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense deductibility | Not deductible |
| Unknown CNAS vs CASNOS status | STOP -- employee vs self-employed determines the social regime |
| Salary ≤ DZD 30,000/month | IRG-exempt -- compute social contributions only |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement and/or payslip (bulletin de paie) for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) residency, (b) employment vs self-employment, and (c) for self-employed, annual turnover (to determine IFU vs real regime).

**Recommended** -- payslips for all months, CNAS/CASNOS contribution records, prior-year IRG assessment or G50/G12 declarations, sales invoices (self-employed), confirmation of dependents/marital status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, all G50 monthly declarations, IFU G12/G12 bis filings, proof of provisional instalments.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No statement or payslip at all = hard stop. Statement without supporting documents = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement / payslip alone. The reviewer must verify the IRG base, social contribution deductions, and any allowances against the CIDTA and the 2025 Finance Law."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-DZ-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether worldwide or only Algeria-sourced income is taxable. This skill cannot compute IRG without confirming residency. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-DZ-2 -- Companies and partnerships.** "This skill covers individual IRG, IFU micro-operators, and employee payroll only. Companies file IBS (corporate tax) separately. Escalate to an Algerian tax professional."

**R-DZ-3 -- Non-resident / expat with treaty relief.** "Non-resident taxation and double-tax-treaty relief require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to an Algerian tax professional."

**R-DZ-4 -- Hydrocarbons / mining-sector income.** "The hydrocarbons sector has a distinct fiscal regime. Out of scope. Escalate to a specialist."

**R-DZ-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax or social-contribution arrears (CNAS 10% + 3%/month, CASNOS 5% + 1%/month, IFU surcharges up to 25%). Do not advise. Escalate to an Algerian tax professional immediately."

**R-DZ-6 -- VAT (TVA) return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (IRG/IFU) and related social contributions only. For Algerian VAT (TVA, standard 19%), use a dedicated VAT skill."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement / ledger transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Patterns use the local terminology (French/Arabic transliteration) common on Algerian bank statements. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, RÉMUNÉRATION, EMPLOYEUR [name] | Employment income (IRG salary base) | Subject to monthly barème IRG after 9% CNAS |

| VIREMENT REÇU, VERSEMENT, DÉPÔT | Potential income | Check direction and counterparty |
| STRIPE, PAYPAL, WISE, PAYONEER PAYOUT | Business income | Platform payout -- match to invoices |
| LOYER REÇU, LOCATION | Rental income | Schedular property rate (see Section 1) |
| DIVIDENDES | Investment income | 15% withholding |
| INTÉRÊTS, PRODUITS FINANCIERS | Investment income | 10% withholding |
| REMBOURSEMENT IMPÔT, RISTOURNE DGI | EXCLUDE | Tax refund, not income |
| SUBVENTION, AIDE ÉTAT | Check nature | Capital grants EXCLUDE; revenue grants = income |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits) -- Deductible (real regime / IFU does NOT deduct expenses)

> **IFU note:** under the IFU micro regime, tax is a flat percentage of *turnover* -- business expenses are NOT separately deductible. The deductible patterns below apply only to operators taxed under the *real regime* (régime réel).

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOYER LOCAL, BAIL COMMERCIAL | Business premises rent | Deductible (real regime) | Dedicated business premises |
| ASSURANCE PRO, RC PROFESSIONNELLE | Professional insurance | Deductible (real regime) | |

| AMENDE, PÉNALITÉ, CONTRAVENTION | Fines/penalties | NOT deductible | Public policy |
| IMPÔT, IRG, IBS, PAIEMENT DGI | Tax payments | NOT deductible | Tax cannot reduce income |
| PRÉLÈVEMENT PERSONNEL, RETRAIT ESPÈCES (personnel) | Drawings | NOT deductible | Not an expense |

### 3.5 Social & Tax Movements (special handling)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Monthly Salary IRG (employee)

**Input line:**
`28/03/2025 ; BNA VIREMENT ; EMPLOYEUR SARL ATLAS ; SALAIRE MARS ; +120,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Gross monthly salary DZD 120,000. Employee CNAS 9% is deducted first to reach the IRG base.
- CNAS 9% × 120,000 = DZD 10,800
- IRG taxable base = 120,000 − 10,800 = DZD 109,200/month
- The monthly barème IRG is the annual scale ÷ 12. Annualised base = 109,200 × 12 = DZD 1,310,400.
- Annual IRG on 1,310,400: 55,200 (band 2) + 129,600 (band 3) + 30% × (1,310,400 − 960,000 = 350,400) = 55,200 + 129,600 + 105,120 = **DZD 289,920/year** ⇒ **DZD 24,160/month**.

**Classification:** IRG base = DZD 109,200/month; IRG ≈ DZD 24,160/month; net ≈ 120,000 − 10,800 − 24,160 = **DZD 85,040**. *(Salary > DZD 30,000 so not exempt. Source: PwC scale + income-determination.)* **[RESEARCH GAP: any spouse/dependent allowance not applied -- see Section 5.2.]**

### Example 2 -- Exempt Low Salary

**Input line:**
`28/03/2025 ; CPA VIREMENT ; EMPLOYEUR ; SALAIRE ; +28,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly salary DZD 28,000 ≤ DZD 30,000 threshold ⇒ **IRG-exempt**. Social contributions still apply: CNAS 9% × 28,000 = DZD 2,520. Net = 28,000 − 2,520 = DZD 25,480.

**Classification:** IRG = DZD 0. CNAS employee = DZD 2,520. *(Source: PwC -- Income determination, DZD 30,000 exemption.)*

### Example 3 -- IFU Micro-Operator (sale of goods)

**Input line (annual turnover total from statement):**
Aggregate business credits for 2025 = DZD 6,000,000, activity = retail (sale of goods).

**Reasoning:**
Turnover DZD 6,000,000 ≤ DZD 8,000,000 ⇒ eligible for IFU. Sale of goods rate = 5%.
- IFU = 5% × 6,000,000 = **DZD 300,000**.
- Above the DZD 20,000 minimum, so the computed amount applies.

**Classification:** IFU = DZD 300,000 (declare on G12 bis). *(Eligibility: CIDTA Art. 282 ter. Rate 5% [RESEARCH GAP -- confirm sector split]. Minimum DZD 20,000 from IMF CR 25/271.)*

### Example 4 -- IFU Micro-Operator (services)

**Input line:**
Aggregate service revenue for 2025 = DZD 1,500,000, activity = consulting (services).

**Reasoning:**
Turnover ≤ DZD 8,000,000 ⇒ IFU eligible. Services rate = 12%.
- IFU = 12% × 1,500,000 = **DZD 180,000**.
- Above DZD 20,000 minimum ⇒ DZD 180,000 applies.

**Classification:** IFU = DZD 180,000. *(Rate 12% [RESEARCH GAP -- confirm].)*

### Example 5 -- CASNOS Self-Employed Contribution

**Input line:**
`30/06/2025 ; BEA PRÉLÈVEMENT ; CASNOS ; COTISATION ANNUELLE ; -36,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
CASNOS contribution at 15% of declared base. If declared base = DZD 240,000 (annualised at the 2025 SNMG of DZD 20,000/month), then 15% × 240,000 = **DZD 36,000**.

**Classification:** CASNOS contribution = DZD 36,000 (annual; due no later than 30 June). *(Rate 15% and SNMG floor from secondary corroboration -- see Section 5; SNMG DZD 20,000 from observalgerie/acf-dz.)* **[RESEARCH GAP -- confirm exact CASNOS base on the official CASNOS site.]**

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BNA VIREMENT INTERNE ; COMPTE ÉPARGNE ; ; -200,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency and Scope

Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Algeria-sourced income. *(Source: PwC -- Taxes on personal income.)*

### 5.2 IRG Salary Mechanics and Allowances

- Gross salary less the employee 9% CNAS contribution gives the IRG taxable base. *(CNAS 9% from PwC -- Other taxes. The "deduct CNAS first" mechanic is standard payroll practice -- [RESEARCH GAP: confirm exact order against CIDTA salary rules.])*
- The monthly barème IRG = annual progressive scale ÷ 12.
- Salaries ≤ DZD 30,000/month are exempt. *(Source: PwC -- Income determination.)*
- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]:** secondary Algerian payroll sources cite a reduction of ~DZD 1,500/month for a non-earning spouse and a per-dependent allowance (≈DZD 12,000/dependent). The PwC authoritative deductions page does NOT confirm these. Do NOT apply them until confirmed against the CIDTA. *(Secondary: https://almawarid.app/blog/comment-calculer-lirg-en-algerie-en-2025-tranches-taux-et-exemples/)*

### 5.3 Deductible vs Non-Deductible (real regime)

Only alimony, mortgage interest, and taxes paid are confirmed deductible for individuals; childcare, education, healthcare, life insurance, and charity are NOT deductible. *(Source: PwC -- Deductions: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/deductions)*

### 5.4 IFU Regime

- Eligibility: annual turnover ≤ DZD 8,000,000 (CIDTA Art. 282 ter), covering industrial, commercial, non-commercial/liberal, artisanal activities and craft cooperatives. *(Source: DGI IFU page.)*
- Rates: 5% (production/sale of goods), 12% (services/other). **[RESEARCH GAP -- confirm sector split against the 2025 Finance Law.]**
- Minimum annual tax: DZD 20,000 (IMF CR 25/271; raised from 10,000 in 2025). **[RESEARCH GAP -- some sources say 30,000.]**
- Under IFU, business expenses are NOT separately deductible -- tax is a flat % of turnover.

### 5.5 Schedular Withholding Rates

Dividends 15%, interest 10%, capital gains 15% (resident) / 20% (non-resident). *(Source: PwC -- Income determination.)*

### 5.6 CNAS -- Employee Social Contributions

**Total 35% of gross salary.**

| Share | Rate of gross |
|---|---|
| Employee | 9% |
| Employer | 26% |
| **Total** | **35%** |

*(Source: PwC -- Other taxes, 14 Jul 2025.)* **Arithmetic check:** 9% + 26% = 35%. ✓

Coverage: retirement, illness/maternity, unemployment, work accidents. No upper contribution ceiling is confirmed by PwC; the floor is the SNMG. *(Source: PwC -- Other taxes.)*

**Branch breakdown (secondary -- almawarid.app):**

| Branch | Employer | Employee |
|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (health/maternity) | 12.5% | 1.5% |
| Retirement | 10.5% | 6.75% |
| Work accidents | 1.25% | -- |
| Unemployment (FNAC) | 1.5% | 0.5% |
| Balance / other | ~0.25% | ~0.25% |

**[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]:** the published sub-rows total ~25.75% employer / 9.25% employee; the exact per-branch allocation reconciling precisely to 26% / 9% must be confirmed against the AAPI official page (https://aapi.dz/en/regimes-sociaux-en/). The headline 26% / 9% / 35% totals are PwC-confirmed; only the per-branch split is uncertain.

### 5.7 CASNOS -- Self-Employed Social Contributions

- Rate: 15% of declared contribution base (split ~7.5% health / ~7.5% retirement). **[RESEARCH GAP -- secondary sources only; confirm on the official CASNOS site.]**
- Minimum base: the SNMG. Minimum contribution ≈ 15% × annual SNMG.
- Payment: annual, due from 1 January, payable no later than 30 June.
- Late penalty: 5% surcharge + 1% per additional month of delay.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee, mid salary.**
Input: Gross DZD 120,000/month, no special exemptions.
Expected: CNAS employee = 10,800; IRG base = 109,200; annualised 1,310,400; annual IRG = 55,200 + 129,600 + (30% × 350,400 = 105,120) = 289,920; monthly IRG = 24,160; net ≈ 85,040.

**Test 2 -- Exempt low salary.**
Input: Gross DZD 28,000/month.
Expected: IRG = 0 (≤ 30,000). CNAS employee = 2,520. Net = 25,480.

**Test 3 -- IFU goods.**
Input: Turnover DZD 6,000,000, sale of goods.
Expected: IFU = 5% × 6,000,000 = 300,000 (> 20,000 minimum). Goods rate [RESEARCH GAP].

**Test 4 -- IFU services.**
Input: Turnover DZD 1,500,000, services.
Expected: IFU = 12% × 1,500,000 = 180,000 (> 20,000 minimum). Services rate [RESEARCH GAP].

**Test 5 -- IFU below minimum.**
Input: Turnover DZD 300,000, services.
Expected: 12% × 300,000 = 36,000 > 20,000 ⇒ IFU = 36,000. (If 12% × turnover had been below 20,000, the DZD 20,000 minimum would apply.)

**Test 6 -- CASNOS at SNMG floor.**
Input: Self-employed, declared base at 2025 SNMG (annual 240,000).
Expected: CASNOS = 15% × 240,000 = 36,000/year, due by 30 June. [RESEARCH GAP on base.]

**Test 7 -- Top-bracket annual IRG.**
Input: Annual taxable income DZD 4,000,000 (real regime).
Expected: 1,106,400 (through 3,840,000) + 35% × (4,000,000 − 3,840,000 = 160,000 = 56,000) = **DZD 1,162,400**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute IRG without confirming residency.
- NEVER apply the IRG scale to a salary ≤ DZD 30,000/month -- it is exempt.

- NEVER apply spouse/dependent allowances until confirmed against the CIDTA (currently [RESEARCH GAP]).
- NEVER state the IFU 5%/12% split or the DZD 20,000 minimum as final without reviewer confirmation against the 2025 Finance Law.
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, or income tax itself as a deduction.
- NEVER include VAT (TVA) collected in business income.
- NEVER treat CNAS/CASNOS contributions or provisional instalments as ordinary expenses.
- NEVER present any [RESEARCH GAP] figure as authoritative.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated, pending professional review.
