# Algeria Social Security / Social Insurance Contributions (CNAS / CASNOS) Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified) skill.** Branch rates rely on CLEISS (authoritative French bilateral social-security source), corroborated by PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries and a 2025 Algerian payroll source. Primary Algerian authorities (CNAS, CASNOS, DGI/Ministère des Finances) were not directly fetched. Every figure carries an inline source or a `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` marker. A warranted Algerian accountant must sign off before filing.

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Algeria (People's Democratic Republic of Algeria) |
| Currency | Algerian Dinar (DZD) only |
| Salaried contribution authority | CNAS (Caisse Nationale des Assurances Sociales des travailleurs salariés) |
| Self-employed contribution authority | CASNOS (Caisse Nationale de Sécurité Sociale des Non-Salariés) |
| Tax authority (IRG/IBS) | DGI — Direction Générale des Impôts, Ministère des Finances (mfdgi.gov.dz) |
| Consolidated rate publisher | CLEISS (cleiss.fr) |
| Salaried total contribution | 35% of gross — 26% employer + 9% employee (CLEISS / PwC) |
| Self-employed (CASNOS) rate | 15% of declared annual income (7.5% insurance + 7.5% retirement) (CLEISS) |
| Minimum wage (SNMG) 2024–2025 | 20,000 DZD/month (CLEISS) |
| Minimum wage (SNMG) from 1 Jan 2026 | 24,000 DZD/month (+20%) (Radio Algérie / North Africa Post) |
| Personal income tax | IRG — progressive 0%–35% (PwC, FL 2022 schedule still current) |
| Salaried monthly IRG exemption | salaries ≤ 30,000 DZD/month effectively exempt (corroborated; see Section 10) |
| CNAS earnings ceiling | No general ceiling for salaried CNAS (CLEISS / PwC) |
| Salaried filing | G50 (tax, incl. IRG withheld) monthly by 20th; CNAS DAC monthly within first 10 days; DAS annual before 31 Jan |
| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by a warranted Algerian accountant |
| Validation date | Pending |

**Contribution regime overview:**

| Regime | Who | Headline rate |
|---|---|---|
| CNAS (salaried) | Employees and their employers | 26% employer + 9% employee = 35% of gross (CLEISS / PwC) |
| CASNOS (non-salaried) | Self-employed, professionals, traders | 15% of declared annual income (CLEISS) |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown employment status (salaried vs self-employed) | STOP — CNAS and CASNOS regimes differ entirely; ask before computing |
| Salaried base unknown | Apply the SNMG floor (20,000 DZD/month for 2024–2025) as the minimum base |
| Self-employed declared income unknown | Apply the CASNOS floor (216,000 DZD/year) (CLEISS) |
| Tax year not stated | Assume 2025 (current research year); confirm SNMG/bracket year before filing |
| Unknown whether a DZD debit is CNAS or IRG/G50 | Classify by counterparty (CNAS vs Trésor/DGI); flag for reviewer if unclear |
| Construction/public-works/hydraulics sector add-on uncertain | Flag — an extra 0.375% unemployment add-on may apply (CLEISS) |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- employment status (salaried vs non-salaried/self-employed) and gross monthly salary (CNAS) or declared annual income (CASNOS). Without employment status, STOP — the two regimes are not interchangeable.

**Recommended** -- the tax year, the employer's sector (construction/public works/hydraulics carries an add-on), and for IRG: residency status and any other Algeria-source income.

**Ideal** -- CNAS DAC declarations, G50 declarations, DAS annual salary declaration, payslips showing the 9% employee deduction and IRG withheld, and bank statements showing CNAS/CASNOS and Trésor/DGI debits.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-DZ-SC-1 -- Employment status unknown.** *Trigger:* not stated whether the client is salaried (CNAS) or self-employed (CASNOS). *Message:* "Employment status is mandatory. Salaried workers contribute 35% via CNAS (26% employer / 9% employee, no ceiling); self-employed contribute 15% via CASNOS within an income band. These regimes are not interchangeable. Cannot proceed without this information."

**R-DZ-SC-2 -- Contribution arrears / penalties.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid CNAS contributions from prior periods. *Message:* "Late CNAS contributions attract a 10% penalty plus 3% per month of delay (majoration de retard) and can trigger legal proceedings (CLEISS / Algerian payroll sources). Do not quantify arrears without a CNAS statement. Escalate to a warranted Algerian accountant."

**R-DZ-SC-3 -- Sector add-ons and exemptions.** *Trigger:* client is in construction, public works, hydraulics, or claims a reduced-rate scheme (e.g. ANSEJ/ANADE start-up exemptions). *Message:* "An additional 0.375% unemployment-branch contribution applies in construction/public works/hydraulics, and start-up/youth-employment schemes may carry temporary exemptions. These require case-specific confirmation. Escalate to a warranted Algerian accountant."

**R-DZ-SC-4 -- Non-resident / expat payroll.** *Trigger:* client is a non-resident, on a bilateral social-security agreement, or seconded into/out of Algeria. *Message:* "Bilateral social-security agreements and secondment relief are outside the scope of this skill. Non-residents are taxed only on Algeria-source professional income (PwC). Escalate to a warranted Algerian accountant."

**R-DZ-SC-5 -- IRG/tax penalty quantification.** *Trigger:* request to quantify statutory IRG late-payment penalties. *Message:* "Specific statutory IRG late-payment penalty percentages are not confirmed from a primary authority in this skill `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the Code des Impôts Directs, mfdgi.gov.dz]`. Do not estimate. Escalate to a warranted Algerian accountant."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Algerian contributions and payroll tax. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Statements may be in French or Arabic. Contribution and IRG payments always EXCLUDE from any VAT (TVA) return — they are statutory payroll/personal obligations, not business supplies.

### 3.1 CNAS salaried contribution debits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNAS | EXCLUDE -- social contribution | Monthly DAC payment of the combined 35% (26% employer + 9% employee) |
| CAISSE NATIONALE ASSURANCES SOCIALES | EXCLUDE -- social contribution | Full CNAS name |
| COTISATION CNAS, COTISATIONS SOCIALES | EXCLUDE -- social contribution | "Contribution" reference |
| DAC, DECLARATION CNAS | EXCLUDE -- social contribution | DAC = the monthly CNAS declaration/payment |
| الضمان الاجتماعي (social security) | EXCLUDE -- social contribution | Arabic-language reference |

### 3.2 CASNOS self-employed contribution debits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CASNOS | EXCLUDE -- self-employed contribution | 15% of declared annual income |
| CAISSE NON-SALARIES, NON SALARIES | EXCLUDE -- self-employed contribution | Full/abbreviated CASNOS reference |
| COTISATION CASNOS | EXCLUDE -- self-employed contribution | Contribution reference |

### 3.3 IRG / income tax payments (NOT a social contribution)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| G50, G-50, G 50 | EXCLUDE -- payroll tax (IRG withheld) | Monthly combined tax declaration, due 20th |
| IRG, IMPOT REVENU GLOBAL | EXCLUDE -- income tax | Not a CNAS/CASNOS contribution |
| TRESOR, RECETTE DES IMPOTS | EXCLUDE -- tax payment to the Treasury | DGI/Trésor counterparty |
| DGI, DIRECTION DES IMPOTS | EXCLUDE -- tax payment | Tax authority |
| IBS, IMPOT BENEFICES SOCIETES | EXCLUDE -- corporate tax | Company-level, not payroll contribution |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, VIREMENT SALAIRE (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net wage transfer, not a CNAS payment |
| SALAIRE (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not a contribution |
| الراتب (salary) | EXCLUDE -- payroll/salary | Arabic-language reference |

### 3.5 Benefits received (not contributions paid)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION CNR, RETRAITE | EXCLUDE -- pension income received | CNR pays pensions; not a contribution |
| ALLOCATION CHOMAGE, CNAC | EXCLUDE -- unemployment benefit received | Inbound benefit, not a contribution |
| ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES | EXCLUDE -- family benefit received | Outside the contribution base entirely |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement classifications from a hypothetical Algerian small employer and a self-employed professional. All amounts in DZD. Currency and figures per CLEISS / PwC research; SNMG 20,000 DZD/month (2024–2025).

### Example 1 -- Monthly CNAS contribution debit (BNA)

**Input line:**
`10.02.2025 ; CNAS COTISATION 01/2025 ; DEBIT ; DAC JANVIER ; -28,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CNAS COTISATION" (pattern 3.1). This is the monthly DAC payment for January 2025. For a single SNMG-floor employee (base 20,000 DZD/month), total contribution = 35% × 20,000 × 4 employees ≈ 28,000 — or one employee at a higher base. Check headcount and base; the combined 35% (26% employer + 9% employee) is remitted together. Exclude from TVA. The employer 26% is a deductible payroll cost; the employee 9% was deducted from the worker's gross.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA -- CNAS social contribution.

### Example 2 -- Employee 9% deduction verification (single SNMG worker)

**Input line:**
`28.02.2025 ; VIREMENT SALAIRE FEVRIER ; DEBIT ; PAIE EMPLOYE ; -18,200.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "VIREMENT SALAIRE" (pattern 3.4) — a net wage transfer, not a contribution. Reconciliation: gross SNMG 20,000 DZD. Employee CNAS 9% = 20,000 × 0.09 = 1,800.00. IRG: monthly salary 20,000 ≤ 30,000 exemption threshold, so IRG ≈ 0 (see Section 10). Net = 20,000 − 1,800 − 0 = 18,200.00 DZD. The figure reconciles. This is payroll expense, not the employer's contribution remittance.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA -- net payroll expense. NOT a CNAS contribution remittance.

### Example 3 -- G50 / IRG payment to the Treasury (NOT a contribution)

**Input line:**
`19.02.2025 ; RECETTE DES IMPOTS G50 ; DEBIT ; IRG SALAIRES 01/2025 ; -9,072.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "RECETTE DES IMPOTS" / "G50" (pattern 3.3). This is the monthly G50 remittance of IRG withheld from salaries, due by the 20th of the following month (Rivermate). It is a tax payment to the DGI/Trésor, NOT a CNAS/CASNOS social contribution. Do not classify as social security. Exclude from TVA.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA -- payroll income tax (IRG via G50). NOT a contribution.

### Example 4 -- CASNOS self-employed annual contribution (CPA bank)

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; CASNOS COTISATION 2025 ; DEBIT ; NON SALARIE ; -90,000.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CASNOS COTISATION" (pattern 3.2). 15% of declared annual income (CLEISS). 90,000 / 0.15 = 600,000 DZD declared annual income, which sits inside the CASNOS band (floor 216,000 → ceiling 4,320,000). Split is 7.5% social insurance (45,000) + 7.5% retirement (45,000). Inside the band, so neither floor nor ceiling bites. Exclude from TVA.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA -- CASNOS self-employed contribution.

### Example 5 -- CASNOS contribution at the floor (low declared income)

**Input line:**
`20.03.2025 ; CASNOS ; DEBIT ; COTISATION MINIMALE ; -32,400.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CASNOS" (pattern 3.2). The CASNOS base is floored at 216,000 DZD/year (CLEISS). 15% × 216,000 = 32,400.00 DZD — the minimum annual CASNOS contribution. Any declared income below 216,000 is contributed on the 216,000 floor, not the lower actual figure. Exclude from TVA.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA -- CASNOS minimum contribution (floored at 216,000 DZD base).

### Example 6 -- Ambiguous CNAS debit (possible arrears + penalty)

**Input line:**
`05.04.2025 ; CNAS REGULARISATION ; DEBIT ; MAJORATION DE RETARD ; -41,500.00 ; DZD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CNAS" (pattern 3.1) but the reference "MAJORATION DE RETARD" signals a late-payment surcharge. Late CNAS contributions carry a 10% penalty plus 3% per month of delay (almawarid). The amount mixes contribution principal with penalty, which cannot be separated without a CNAS statement. The penalty portion is not a normal deductible contribution. Flag for reviewer.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Flag for reviewer -- request a CNAS statement to split contribution principal from the 10% + 3%/month penalty.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when bank statement data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 -- Salaried CNAS formula

```
CNAS_total    = gross_salary x 35%
CNAS_employer = gross_salary x 26%
CNAS_employee = gross_salary x 9%
```

Headline 26% employer / 9% employee / 35% total (CLEISS / PwC). The employer remits both shares monthly. No general earnings ceiling applies (CLEISS / PwC).

### Rule 2 -- CNAS branch breakdown (effective 1 Jan 2024)

The 35% headline decomposes into statutory branches (CLEISS):

| Branch | Employer | Employee | Other | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (illness, maternity, disability, death) | 11.5% | 1.5% | — | 13% |
| Work accidents & occupational illness | 1.25% | — | — | 1.25% |
| Retirement | 11% | 6.75% | 0.50% (FNPOS housing fund) | 18.25% |
| Early retirement | 0.25% | 0.25% | — | 0.5% |
| Unemployment insurance | 1% | 0.5% | — | 1.5% |
| **TOTAL** | **25% (+0.50% FNPOS)** | **9%** | **0.50%** | **34.5%** |

The headline **26% employer** is the commonly-cited figure including the 0.50% FNPOS and minor sector add-ons; CLEISS itemises pure employer branches at 25% + 0.50% FNPOS = 25.5% (PwC / CLEISS reconciliation). Employer column 11.5 + 1.25 + 11 + 0.25 + 1 = **25.0%**; employee column 1.5 + 0 + 6.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 = **9.0%**; grand total **34.5%** (35% with rounding/sector add-ons). Source: https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/cotisations/algerie.html

### Rule 3 -- Construction / public works / hydraulics add-on

An additional **0.375%** (unemployment branch) applies in construction, public works, and hydraulics sectors (CLEISS). Add to the employer side where the sector applies; otherwise omit.

### Rule 4 -- Contribution base (salaried)

The base is all gross salary elements, **excluding** family benefits, expense reimbursements, departure/severance bonuses, and certain hardship allowances (CLEISS). The SNMG minimum wage (20,000 DZD/month in 2024–2025; 24,000 DZD/month from 1 Jan 2026) effectively floors the base. No general ceiling (CLEISS / PwC).

### Rule 5 -- Employee 9% is deductible for IRG

The employee's 9% CNAS deduction is subtracted from gross salary to arrive at the IRG taxable base (CLEISS). Compute IRG on (gross − employee social contribution).

### Rule 6 -- Self-employed CASNOS formula

```
CASNOS = clamp(declared_annual_income, 216,000, 4,320,000) x 15%
```

15% = 7.5% social insurance + 7.5% retirement (CLEISS). Floor base 216,000 DZD/year (min contribution 32,400); ceiling base 4,320,000 DZD/year (max contribution 648,000). Source: https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/cotisations/algerie.html

### Rule 7 -- IRG progressive brackets (annual)

Progressive 0%–35% on annual taxable income (PwC, FL 2022 schedule still current per PwC last reviewed 14 July 2025):

| Annual taxable income (DZD) | Marginal rate | Tax at top of band | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ 240,000 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| 240,001 – 480,000 | 23% | 55,200 | 55,200 |
| 480,001 – 960,000 | 27% | 129,600 | 184,800 |
| 960,001 – 1,920,000 | 30% | 288,000 | 472,800 |
| 1,920,001 – 3,840,000 | 33% | 633,600 | 1,106,400 |
| > 3,840,000 | 35% | — | — |

Cumulative check: 0 → +55,200 → +129,600 = 184,800 → +288,000 = 472,800 → +633,600 = 1,106,400. Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/taxes-on-personal-income

### Rule 8 -- Monthly salary IRG exemption

Salaries not exceeding **30,000 DZD/month** are effectively exempt from IRG (search result; corroborates the 240,000 annual threshold plus salary-relief mechanics). For salaried workers, apply payroll-specific relief; do not apply the raw annual table without confirming the salary-withholding schedule `[RESEARCH GAP — confirm the exact salaried IRG withholding/abatement table against the DGI / Code des Impôts Directs, mfdgi.gov.dz]`.

### Rule 9 -- Filing schedule

| Obligation | Frequency | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| G50 (tax, incl. IRG salaries withheld) | Monthly | 20th of month following salary payment | Rivermate |
| CNAS contribution declaration/payment (DAC) | Monthly | Within first 10 days of following month | almawarid |
| DAS (Déclaration Annuelle des Salaires) | Annual | Before 31 January following year | almawarid |
| Annual income tax return | Annual | ~30 April following the tax year | Rivermate |

The CNAS 10-day deadline (almawarid) is the social-security-specific one; the 20th is the G50 tax deadline. Some EOR guides cite the 20th for CNAS too `[RESEARCH GAP — confirm exact CNAS monthly deadline against cnas.dz]`.

### Rule 10 -- Universal mandatory affiliation

All salaried workers must be affiliated to CNAS, and all non-salaried/self-employed to CASNOS, from the first day of activity. There is **no income threshold for affiliation** — coverage is universal and mandatory (CLEISS).

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When bank statement data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these situations for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- Salaried vs self-employed boundary (mixed activity)

**Trigger:** Client draws a salary and also earns self-employed/professional income.

**Issue:** Salaried income falls under CNAS (35%); self-employed income under CASNOS (15%). Both regimes can apply simultaneously on different income streams.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Split the income streams and confirm dual affiliation before computing.

### T2-2 -- Sector-specific add-on (construction / public works / hydraulics)

**Trigger:** Employer operates in construction, public works, or hydraulics.

**Issue:** An extra 0.375% unemployment-branch contribution applies (CLEISS). It is easy to omit.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Confirm the sector classification and add the 0.375% to the employer side.

### T2-3 -- Rate-source reconciliation (26% vs 25.5%)

**Trigger:** A contribution figure does not reconcile to a clean 26% employer.

**Issue:** CLEISS itemises pure employer branches at 25% + 0.50% FNPOS = 25.5%, while PwC and Algerian summaries cite a headline 26% (rounding/sector add-ons). A second 2025 source (almawarid) allocates branches slightly differently (Health-Maternity 12.5%/1.5%; Retirement 10.5%/6.75%) but reaches the same ~26%/9% totals.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer where the exact branch split matters (e.g. branch-level reconciliation). Use 26%/9%/35% as the headline.

### T2-4 -- CNAS / CASNOS arrears and penalties

**Trigger:** Client has unpaid contributions from prior periods.

**Issue:** Late CNAS contributions attract 10% + 3% per month of delay and can trigger legal proceedings (almawarid). Principal and penalty cannot be separated without a CNAS statement.

**Action:** Do not quantify arrears. Escalate to a warranted Algerian accountant.

### T2-5 -- Salaried IRG withholding vs annual table

**Trigger:** Need to compute IRG actually withheld from a salary.

**Issue:** The 30,000 DZD/month exemption and salary-specific abatements differ from a naive application of the annual 0%–35% table. The exact salaried withholding schedule is not confirmed from a primary authority.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Confirm against the DGI / Code des Impôts Directs `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` before relying on a computed net-pay figure.

### T2-6 -- 2026 SNMG change and Finance Law 2025 floors

**Trigger:** Computation spans into 2026, or involves the lump-sum/minimum tax regime.

**Issue:** SNMG rises to 24,000 DZD/month from 1 Jan 2026 (Radio Algérie / North Africa Post). Finance Law 2025 reportedly raised the minimum lump-sum tax (IFU/FRT) floor to DZD 30,000 from DZD 10,000 effective 1 Jan 2026 `[RESEARCH GAP — verify exact wording at https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/significant-developments]`.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Confirm which year's SNMG and tax floors apply.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How contribution and tax debits appear on Algerian bank statements

Statements from Algerian banks (BNA — Banque Nationale d'Algérie; BEA — Banque Extérieure d'Algérie; CPA — Crédit Populaire d'Algérie; BADR; BDL) are typically in **French**, sometimes Arabic. Amounts are in DZD with no decimal subunit in common use (the centime is largely nominal).

**CNAS (salaried contributions):**
- Description: "CNAS", "COTISATION CNAS", "DAC", "CAISSE NATIONALE ASSURANCES SOCIALES"
- Timing: Monthly, around the first 10 days for the prior month
- Amount: ~35% of total gross payroll (combined employer 26% + employee 9%)

**CASNOS (self-employed contributions):**
- Description: "CASNOS", "COTISATION CASNOS", "NON SALARIE"
- Timing: Typically annual (15% of declared annual income)
- Amount: 15% of declared income, within the 216,000–4,320,000 base band

**G50 / IRG (income tax to the Treasury):**
- Description: "G50", "RECETTE DES IMPOTS", "TRESOR", "IRG SALAIRES", "DGI"
- Timing: Monthly by the 20th
- Counterparty: DGI / Trésor, NOT CNAS/CASNOS

**Key identification tips:**
1. Contribution debits are always outgoing (DEBIT), never credits — inbound CNR/CNAC credits are benefits received, not contributions.
2. CNAS debits recur monthly; CASNOS typically annual.
3. Counterparty distinguishes regime: CNAS/CASNOS = social contribution; Trésor/DGI/G50 = income tax.
4. A "MAJORATION DE RETARD" or "REGULARISATION" reference signals penalties/arrears — flag for reviewer.
5. Family benefits (ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES) are outside the contribution base entirely.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Determine the regime** -- look for CNAS (salaried) vs CASNOS (self-employed) debit counterparties.
2. **Scan for contribution debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns.
3. **Reverse-engineer the base:**
   - CNAS monthly debit ÷ 0.35 ≈ total gross monthly payroll base.
   - CASNOS debit ÷ 0.15 ≈ declared annual income (then check it sits within 216,000–4,320,000).
   - If a CASNOS debit ≈ 32,400, the floor (216,000 base) is in play.
4. **Separate tax from contributions** -- G50/Trésor/DGI debits are IRG (income tax), not social contributions.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Regime and base derived from bank statement amounts only. Employment status, sector, and declared income have not been independently verified. Salaried IRG withholding and any sector add-on require confirmation before filing."

### Worked IRG reconciliation (illustrative — confirm salaried schedule before use)

Annual gross 960,000 DZD (80,000/month). Employee CNAS 9% = 86,400. IRG annual-table base = 960,000 − 86,400 = 873,600.
IRG on 873,600 = 0 (first 240,000) + 23% × (480,000 − 240,000) = 55,200 + 27% × (873,600 − 480,000) = 27% × 393,600 = 106,272 → **total IRG 161,472**.
Annual net = 960,000 − 86,400 − 161,472 = **712,128 DZD**. (Illustrative on the annual table; the salaried monthly withholding schedule may differ — see Rule 8 / T2-5.)

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Salaried, gross 20,000 DZD/month (SNMG floor). -> Employer 26% = 5,200; Employee 9% = 1,800; Total 35% = 7,000. IRG ≈ 0 (≤ 30,000/month exemption). Net pay = 20,000 − 1,800 = 18,200.

**Test 2:** Salaried, gross 100,000 DZD/month. -> Employer 26% = 26,000; Employee 9% = 9,000; Total 35% = 35,000. (Branch check: employer 25% + 0.50% FNPOS reconciles to 25.5%; headline 26%.)

**Test 3:** CASNOS, declared income 600,000 DZD/yr. -> 15% × 600,000 = 90,000 (45,000 insurance + 45,000 retirement). Inside band 216,000–4,320,000.

**Test 4:** CASNOS, declared income 100,000 DZD/yr (below floor). -> floored at 216,000; 15% × 216,000 = 32,400 minimum.

**Test 5:** CASNOS, declared income 6,000,000 DZD/yr (above ceiling). -> capped at 4,320,000; 15% × 4,320,000 = 648,000 maximum.

**Test 6:** Salaried, annual gross 960,000 DZD, resident. -> Employee CNAS 9% = 86,400; IRG annual-table base 873,600; IRG = 161,472; net = 712,128. (Illustrative — confirm salaried withholding schedule.)

**Test 7:** Construction-sector salaried, gross 50,000 DZD/month. -> Standard employer 26% = 13,000 PLUS 0.375% add-on = 187.50, employer total 13,187.50; employee 9% = 4,500.

**Test 8:** CNAS monthly debit observed = 7,000 DZD, single employee. -> 7,000 / 0.35 = 20,000 implied gross base (SNMG floor). Reconciles.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute contributions without first establishing whether the client is salaried (CNAS) or self-employed (CASNOS) — the regimes differ entirely.
- NEVER apply a general earnings ceiling to salaried CNAS — none is reported (CLEISS / PwC).
- NEVER omit the 0.375% sector add-on for construction/public works/hydraulics without confirming the sector.
- NEVER apply the raw annual IRG table as if it were the salaried monthly withholding without confirming the schedule — flag the `[RESEARCH GAP]`.
- NEVER tell a self-employed client they owe contributions below the CASNOS floor — the 216,000 DZD base (32,400 DZD min) always applies.
- NEVER conflate CNAS/CASNOS (social contribution) with G50/IRG (income tax) — they go to different authorities.
- NEVER quantify contribution or tax arrears/penalties without an official CNAS or DGI statement — escalate.
- NEVER state a statutory IRG late-payment penalty percentage — it is unconfirmed `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`.
- NEVER mix tax years' SNMG figures — 20,000 DZD applies through 2025; 24,000 DZD from 1 Jan 2026.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — this is a Tier 2 skill pending warranted-accountant sign-off.
