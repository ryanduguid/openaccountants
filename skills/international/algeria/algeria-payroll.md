## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (IRG — Traitements et Salaires)

Algeria **does** levy personal income tax on salaries. The employer is the
**withholding agent**: it deducts IRG monthly from payroll (*retenue à la source*) and
remits it on the **G50** declaration (PwC — Taxes on personal income; Rivermate). The
progressive scale was introduced by the **Loi de Finances 2022 (FL 2022), effective
1 January 2022**, and remains the current scale for 2025 (no replacement scale published
for 2025/2026 as of the research date).

### IRG Progressive Scale — annual taxable salary income (DZD)

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Algeria — Individual / Taxes on personal income,
"effective FL 2022, marginal rate 35%"); DGI press release via Radio Algérienne
(news.radioalgerie.dz/fr/node/3142). (The DGI page
`mfdgi.gov.dz/fr/particuliers/irg-traitements-et-salaires` corroborates these figures but
could not be machine-fetched due to a TLS certificate-chain error — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer
to confirm the scale directly on the DGI site in a browser]**.)

| Annual taxable income (DZD) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (DZD) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 240,000 | **0% (exonéré)** | 0.00 |
| 240,001 – 480,000 | **23%** | 55,200.00 |
| 480,001 – 960,000 | **27%** | 184,800.00 |
| 960,001 – 1,920,000 | **30%** | 472,800.00 |
| 1,920,001 – 3,840,000 | **33%** | 1,106,400.00 |
| Above 3,840,000 | **35%** | — |

**Subtract-method constants** — `IRG = (annual taxable income × rate) − subtract`:

| Band | Rate | Subtract (DZD) |
|---|---|---|
| 240,001 – 480,000 | 23% | 55,200.00 |
| 480,001 – 960,000 | 27% | 74,400.00 |
| 960,001 – 1,920,000 | 30% | 103,200.00 |
| 1,920,001 – 3,840,000 | 33% | 160,800.00 |
| 3,840,001+ | 35% | 237,600.00 |

*Continuity check:* at 480,000 → 0.23 × 480,000 − 55,200 = **55,200.00**;
at 960,000 → 0.27 × 960,000 − 74,400 = **184,800.00**;
at 1,920,000 → 0.30 × 1,920,000 − 103,200 = **472,800.00**;
at 3,840,000 → 0.33 × 3,840,000 − 160,800 = **1,106,400.00**. All bands tie out.

### Monthly full exemption

- Salaries **up to 30,000 DA/month are fully exempt** from IRG, regardless of the annual-scale
  outcome (DGI / Radio Algérienne — news.radioalgerie.dz/fr/node/3142). Apply this exemption as
  a hard gate: if monthly gross ≤ 30,000 DA, **IRG = 0**.

### Salary abattement (professional-expense deduction)

- A **40% deduction** is applied to salary income before the scale, **floored at 12,000 DA/year
  (1,000 DA/month)** and **capped at 18,000 DA/year (1,500 DA/month)** (Radio Algérienne —
  node/3142).

### IRG base — order of operations

IRG is computed on salary **net of employee social contributions** (the 9% CNAS employee share
is deducted first) and after the 40% abattement, then the annual scale is applied:

1. Start from monthly gross salary.
2. Subtract employee CNAS (9%) → salary after social contributions.
3. Subtract the 40% abattement (min 1,000 / max 1,500 DA per month) → monthly IRG base.
4. Annualise (× 12), apply the progressive scale (subtract-method), divide by 12 → monthly IRG.
5. If monthly gross ≤ 30,000 DA, override IRG to 0 (full exemption).

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The exact ordering (abattement vs. social-contribution
> deduction) and whether the 30,000 DA exemption is a clean gate or interacts with the abattement
> floor should be confirmed against the DGI's IRG-Traitements-et-Salaires text before finalizing.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- CNAS (Employee + Employer)

CNAS social security runs across five branches. The **total statutory rate is 35% of gross
salary = employer 26% + employee 9%** (PwC — Other taxes; Rivermate). Contributions are levied
on **gross salary with no upper ceiling** (uncapped) for the general salaried regime; the
effective **floor is the SNMG minimum wage** — contributions cannot be based on less than the
SNMG (PwC; Rivermate; CLEISS).

### Operative payroll figures

| Side | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Employee CNAS | **9%** | Gross salary (uncapped; floor = SNMG) |
| Employer CNAS | **26%** | Gross salary (uncapped; floor = SNMG) |
| **Total** | **35%** | — |

Source: PwC (taxsummaries.pwc.com/algeria/individual/other-taxes); Rivermate
(rivermate.com/guides/algeria/taxes).

### Branch-by-branch breakdown (CLEISS, effective 1 January 2024, unchanged into 2025)

Source: CLEISS — official French inter-scheme liaison body (cleiss.fr/docs/cotisations/algerie.html).

| Branch | Employer | Employee | Other funds | Total |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Assurances sociales (sickness, maternity, disability, death) | 11.5% | 1.5% | — | 13.0% |
| Accidents du travail / maladies professionnelles | 1.25% | — | — | 1.25% |
| Retraite (pension) | 11.0% | 6.75% | 0.5% (FNPOS social-housing) | 18.25% |
| Retraite anticipée (early retirement) | 0.25% | 0.25% | — | 0.5% |
| Assurance chômage (unemployment) | 1.0% | 0.5% | — | 1.5% |
| **TOTALS** | **25.0%** | **9.0%** | **0.5%** | **34.5%** |

*Column check:* employer 11.5 + 1.25 + 11.0 + 0.25 + 1.0 = **25.0%**;
employee 1.5 + 0 + 6.75 + 0.25 + 0.5 = **9.0%**; other = **0.5%**; grand total = **34.5%**.

**Reconciliation note (important):** CLEISS itemises the employer side as **25% + 0.5% FNPOS
social-housing levy = 25.5%**; adding **0.5% for *œuvres sociales*** (social works) brings the
headline employer figure to the commonly cited **26%**. The Big-4 / payroll summaries (PwC,
Rivermate) state the headline as a flat **employer 26% / employee 9% / total 35%**. Both describe
the same regime; the 35% headline includes the social-works and housing-fund components that
CLEISS lists separately. **Use 26% employer / 9% employee / 35% total as the operative payroll
figures**, with the CLEISS table as the branch detail.

### Sector add-on (construction)

- Construction / public works / hydraulics pay an **extra 0.375% each** (employer and employee)
  via **CACOBATPH** (sector leave / bad-weather fund) (CLEISS). Apply only for those sectors.

---

## Section 4 -- Minimum Wage — SNMG (Salaire National Minimum Garanti)

The SNMG is a single national figure applying to public and private sectors. It is the **floor
for CNAS contributions** (contributions cannot be based on less than the SNMG).

| Year | SNMG (DZD/month) | Status | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 | **20,000** | In effect | Algeria Invest; Radio Algérienne |
| 2026 | **24,000** (≈+20%) | Approved by Council of Ministers, effective **1 January 2026** | Algeria Invest; Radio Algérienne; WageIndicator |

Sources: Algeria Invest (algeriainvest.com — "le SNMG passe à 24 000 dinars"); Radio Algérienne
(news.radioalgerie.dz/en/node/75102); WageIndicator (wageindicator.org — "minimum wage revised in
Algeria from 01 January 2026").

> Context only (not a payroll deduction): the unemployment allowance (*allocation chômage*) was
> raised to **18,000 DA** alongside the 2026 SNMG hike (Algeria Invest).

## Section 5 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative** assumption (the one that does
NOT understate withholding/contributions) and FLAG it for the reviewer.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Tax year | Default to **2025** scale (FL 2022, still current) | Skill tax_year is 2025; no 2026 scale published |
| Sector (construction add-on) | Assume **no** CACOBATPH 0.375% add-on unless told construction | Avoids over-stating; flag if sector unknown |
| Whether gross ≤ 30,000 DA | Apply the **full IRG exemption** strictly at/below 30,000 DA | Statutory exemption |
| Abattement amount | Apply 40% floored 1,000 / capped 1,500 DA/month | Statutory bounds |
| CNAS base below SNMG | Floor the contribution base at the **SNMG** (20,000 DA for 2025) | Contributions cannot be below SNMG |
| CNAS ceiling | **None** — compute on full gross (uncapped) | General salaried regime is uncapped |
| Currency | Algerian Dinar (DZD) | Wages are paid in Dinars |
| Headline CNAS split | **26% employer / 9% employee / 35% total** | Operative figure per PwC/Rivermate |

## Section 6 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing payroll

1. Monthly gross salary in DZD (and whether it is the ordinary/fixed base).
2. Tax/fiscal year (defaults to 2025 scale).
3. Sector (to decide the CACOBATPH 0.375% construction add-on).
4. Whether the salary is at or below the SNMG floor (20,000 DA for 2025 / 24,000 DA for 2026).
5. Any non-ordinary pay components (bonuses, primes, indemnités) and their treatment.

### Refusal catalogue — DO NOT compute, refuse and request input

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No gross salary provided | REFUSE — request monthly salary in DZD |
| Salary stated in EUR/USD with no DZD conversion and no rate | REFUSE — request DZD figure |
| Request to omit IRG withholding or CNAS to "save money" | REFUSE — these are statutory; escalate to accountant |
| Salary below the SNMG offered as the contribution base | REFUSE — base cannot fall below the SNMG |
| Request to ignore the 30,000 DA monthly IRG exemption | REFUSE — statutory exemption; flag |
| Self-employed / non-salarié income mixed in | REFUSE payroll path — non-salariés have a separate CNAS band and IRG treatment |
| Definitive "this is your exact tax" assertion requested | REFUSE — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |

## Section 7 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Classify bank-statement lines deterministically. Match case-insensitively; longest / most-specific
pattern wins.

### Salary credits (money arriving in an employee account)

| Pattern (regex-ish, case-insensitive) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SALAIRE`, `VIR.* SALAIRE`, `PAIE`, `VIREMENT SALAIRE` | Net salary payment |
| `ACOMPTE`, `AVANCE SUR SALAIRE` | Salary advance (not net pay; clears against salary) |
| `PRIME`, `INDEMNITE`, `IFSP`, `IEP` | Allowance / bonus component |
| `RAPPEL`, `RAPPEL SALAIRE` | Back-pay / arrears |
| `REMBOURSEMENT CNAS`, `IJ CNAS` | CNAS reimbursement / daily indemnity — not ordinary salary |

### Employer debits (money leaving the employer account)

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `IRG`, `G50`, `RETENUE SOURCE`, `VERSEMENT IRG` | IRG withholding remitted to DGI (liability settlement) |
| `CNAS`, `COTISATION CNAS`, `SECURITE SOCIALE` | CNAS contribution (employer + employee portions) |
| `CACOBATPH` | Construction sector leave / bad-weather fund (0.375% each) |
| `DAS`, `DECLARATION ANNUELLE` | Annual salary declaration filing (CNAS) |
| `VIREMENT PAIE`, `SALAIRES`, `NOMINATIVE PAIE` | Net wages disbursed to employees |

## Section 8 -- Worked Examples

> All figures use the **FL 2022 (2025-current)** IRG scale, CNAS **employee 9%** and the
> **40% abattement** (capped 1,500 DA/month). IRG base = (gross − 9% CNAS − abattement),
> annualised, scaled, ÷ 12. The 30,000 DA/month full exemption overrides to IRG = 0.
> Amounts rounded to the cent. Construction add-on excluded (general sector).

### Example 1 — At the 2026 SNMG, fully IRG-exempt

**Inputs:** Gross 24,000 DA/month (the 2026 SNMG).

- Employee CNAS 9% = 0.09 × 24,000 = **2,160.00**.
- Salary after CNAS = 24,000 − 2,160 = 21,840.00.
- Gross ≤ 30,000 DA → **IRG = 0.00** (full monthly exemption).
- **Net pay** = 24,000 − 2,160 − 0 = **21,840.00 DA**.

*Bank line example:* `VIR SALAIRE — MARS` credit **21,840.00 DA**.

### Example 2 — Just at the 30,000 DA exemption ceiling

**Inputs:** Gross 30,000 DA/month.

- Employee CNAS 9% = 0.09 × 30,000 = **2,700.00**.
- Salary after CNAS = 30,000 − 2,700 = 27,300.00.
- Gross = 30,000 DA ≤ 30,000 → **IRG = 0.00** (exemption applies at and below 30,000).
  *(Note: without the exemption, the annualised base would be (27,300 − 1,500) × 12 = 309,600,
  which falls in the 23% band and would otherwise yield IRG — the exemption is what zeroes it.)*
- **Net pay** = 30,000 − 2,700 − 0 = **27,300.00 DA**.

### Example 3 — Mid earner, into the 23%/27% bands

**Inputs:** Gross 45,000 DA/month.

- Employee CNAS 9% = 0.09 × 45,000 = **4,050.00**.
- Salary after CNAS = 45,000 − 4,050 = 40,950.00.
- Abattement = min(0.40 × 40,950, 1,500) = **1,500.00** (capped).
- Monthly IRG base = 40,950 − 1,500 = 39,450.00 → annualised = 39,450 × 12 = **473,400.00**
  (in the 23% band: 240,001–480,000).
- IRG annual = 0.23 × 473,400 − 55,200 = 108,882.00 − 55,200 = **53,682.00**.
- IRG monthly = 53,682.00 ÷ 12 = **4,473.50**.
- **Net pay** = 45,000 − 4,050 − 4,473.50 = **36,476.50 DA**.

### Example 4 — Higher earner, into the 27% band

**Inputs:** Gross 80,000 DA/month.

- Employee CNAS 9% = 0.09 × 80,000 = **7,200.00**.
- Salary after CNAS = 80,000 − 7,200 = 72,800.00.
- Abattement = **1,500.00** (capped).
- Monthly IRG base = 72,800 − 1,500 = 71,300.00 → annualised = 855,600.00
  (in the 27% band: 480,001–960,000).
- IRG annual = 0.27 × 855,600 − 74,400 = 231,012.00 − 74,400 = **156,612.00**.
- IRG monthly = 156,612.00 ÷ 12 = **13,051.00**.
- **Net pay** = 80,000 − 7,200 − 13,051.00 = **59,749.00 DA**.

### Example 5 — Top-band earner (35% marginal)

**Inputs:** Gross 400,000 DA/month.

- Employee CNAS 9% = 0.09 × 400,000 = **36,000.00**.
- Salary after CNAS = 400,000 − 36,000 = 364,000.00.
- Abattement = **1,500.00** (capped).
- Monthly IRG base = 364,000 − 1,500 = 362,500.00 → annualised = 4,350,000.00
  (above 3,840,000 → 35% band).
- IRG annual = 0.35 × 4,350,000 − 237,600 = 1,522,500.00 − 237,600 = **1,284,900.00**.
- IRG monthly = 1,284,900.00 ÷ 12 = **107,075.00**.
- **Net pay** = 400,000 − 36,000 − 107,075.00 = **256,925.00 DA**.

### Example 6 — Employer total cost of an 80,000 DA/month earner

Building on Example 4 (gross 80,000 DA/month, general sector):

| Employer cost item | Computation | Amount (DZD) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross salary | — | 80,000.00 |
| Employer CNAS 26% | 0.26 × 80,000 | 20,800.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | sum | **100,800.00** |

*Check:* 80,000 + 20,800 = **100,800.00**. Employer-on-top burden = 20,800 = 26% of gross.
(Construction add-on would add 0.375% × 80,000 = 300.00 DA on top — excluded here.)

---

## Section 9 -- Tier 1 Rules (hard, non-negotiable)

1. IRG is **employer-withheld monthly** (retenue à la source) and remitted to the DGI on the
   **G50**; never skip it for salaried staff (PwC; Rivermate).
2. Apply the IRG base order: gross → minus 9% CNAS → minus 40% abattement (1,000–1,500 DA/month)
   → annualise → progressive scale (subtract-method) → ÷ 12.
3. Salaries **≤ 30,000 DA/month are fully IRG-exempt** — override IRG to 0 (DGI/Radio Algérienne).
4. CNAS is **employee 9% + employer 26% = 35% total**, on **uncapped** gross, floored at the SNMG
   (PwC; Rivermate; CLEISS).
5. The CNAS contribution base can **never** fall below the **SNMG** (20,000 DA for 2025;
   24,000 DA for 2026).
6. Construction / public-works employers add **CACOBATPH 0.375% each** (employer and employee)
   (CLEISS).
7. Wages are paid in **Algerian Dinars**.
8. CNAS contributions are remitted **monthly**; the **DAS** annual return is due **31 January**;
   the **G50** is due by the **20th of the following month** (Rivermate; Radio Algérienne; Fatoura).
9. Every output is an **estimate** pending licensed-accountant sign-off.

## Section 10 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

| Question | Why it needs a reviewer |
|---|---|
| Exact ordering of abattement vs. CNAS deduction in the IRG base | Not cleanly confirmed against DGI text |
| Interaction of the 30,000 DA exemption with the abattement floor | Mechanic not fully documented |
| Whether the FL 2022 scale still applies for the period in question | No 2025/2026 replacement published; verify currency |
| Exact IRG (G50) late-payment penalty percentages | Not confirmed from a primary DGI source |
| Precise date of the annual DGI salary recap (~30 April) | Secondary source only |
| CACOBATPH applicability for a given employer | Sector-specific |
| Treatment of specific primes / indemnités (taxable vs exempt) | Component-specific, needs ruling |
| Headline 26% vs CLEISS 25.5% employer reconciliation | Two presentations of the same regime |

## Section 13 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data:

1. **No prior payroll register (livre de paie) available** → request the last 3 months of payslips,
   G50 declarations, and CNAS bordereaux to back-solve the rates actually applied.
2. **Unknown sector** → default CACOBATPH off, FLAG; confirm before the first remittance.
3. **Salary near the SNMG** → confirm the contribution base is floored at the SNMG (20,000 DA for
   2025 / 24,000 DA for 2026), never below.
4. **Year ambiguity** → default to the 2025 (FL 2022) scale; verify whether any new finance law
   has replaced it for periods after the research date.
5. **Mixed self-employed income** → route non-salarié income to a separate treatment; the
   non-salariés CNAS band (216,000–4,320,000 DZD/year, CLEISS) and IRG treatment differ.

## Section 15 -- Registration

- Employers must register with **CNAS** as an *affilié employeur* and obtain an employer number
  **before the first payroll**; each employee is registered and assigned a social security number.
  Registration is triggered by **hiring the first employee** — there is **no monetary threshold**;
  any employer of salaried staff must register (CNAS employer portal, `cnas.dz/en/employer/`).
- Tax registration (**NIF — numéro d'identification fiscale**) with the DGI is required for the G50.

## Section 16 -- Penalties (late filing / late payment)

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CNAS — late / non-declaration of contributions | **15% of contributions due** (base penalty) **plus a 2%-per-month surcharge (majoration de retard)** for the period of delay | Fatoura / CNAS rules (fatoura.app), corroborated by multiple payroll guides |
| IRG (G50) — late payment | Standard DGI late-payment penalties apply (typically **10% if paid within the month after the deadline, rising thereafter, plus monthly interest / indemnité de retard**) | Rivermate / general — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact percentages against the Code des Procédures Fiscales]** |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The exact IRG late-payment penalty percentages were not
> confirmed from a primary DGI source in this research. Read them directly from the *Code des
> Procédures Fiscales* before relying on specific figures.

## Section 17 -- Summary Employer/Employee Burden (general sector)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Base/cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| IRG | 0% / 23% / 27% / 30% / 33% / 35% progressive | (withholding agent) | annual taxable base; ≤30,000 DA/mo exempt |
| CNAS (all branches) | 9% | 26% | uncapped gross; floor = SNMG |
| CACOBATPH (construction only) | 0.375% | 0.375% | gross (construction sector) |

*Check:* CNAS employee 9% + employer 26% = **35% total** (operative figures, PwC/Rivermate);
CLEISS branch detail sums to 25% employer + 9% employee + 0.5% other = 34.5% (same regime,
social-works component shown separately).

## Section 19 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputes end-to-end. Expected values use the FL 2022 (2025-current) scale, CNAS
employee 9%, and the 40% abattement (capped 1,500 DA/month).

1. **2026 SNMG, exempt.** Gross 24,000 DA/mo. Employee CNAS = **2,160.00**; IRG = **0.00**
   (≤ 30,000 exemption); net = **21,840.00**.
2. **Exemption ceiling.** Gross 30,000 DA/mo. Employee CNAS = **2,700.00**; IRG = **0.00**
   (exemption applies at 30,000); net = **27,300.00**.
3. **23% band.** Gross 45,000 DA/mo. After CNAS 40,950; abattement 1,500; annual base **473,400**;
   IRG annual **53,682.00**; IRG monthly **4,473.50**; net **36,476.50**.
4. **27% band.** Gross 80,000 DA/mo. After CNAS 72,800; annual base **855,600**;
   IRG annual **156,612.00**; IRG monthly **13,051.00**; net **59,749.00**.
5. **35% band.** Gross 400,000 DA/mo. After CNAS 364,000; annual base **4,350,000**;
   IRG annual **1,284,900.00**; IRG monthly **107,075.00**; net **256,925.00**.
6. **Employer cost.** Gross 80,000 DA/mo, general sector. Employer CNAS 26% = **20,800.00**;
   total employer cost = **100,800.00**.
7. **Bracket continuity.** Annual base 480,000 → IRG **55,200.00**; 960,000 → **184,800.00**;
   1,920,000 → **472,800.00**; 3,840,000 → **1,106,400.00** (subtract constants tie out).
8. **Branch totals.** CLEISS employer column = **25.0%**, employee column = **9.0%**,
   grand total = **34.5%**.
9. **SNMG floor.** Contribution base for a 15,000 DA/mo nominal wage is floored at the SNMG
   (20,000 DA for 2025) → REFUSE a base below SNMG and flag.
10. **Currency refusal.** Salary stated in EUR with no DZD conversion → REFUSE and request the
    Dinar figure.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER skip IRG withholding for salaried employees — the employer is the legal withholding agent.
- NEVER apply IRG to a salary of 30,000 DA/month or less — it is fully exempt.
- NEVER omit the 40% abattement (capped 1,500 DA/month) before applying the IRG scale.
- NEVER apply a CNAS contribution base below the SNMG (20,000 DA for 2025 / 24,000 DA for 2026).
- NEVER cap CNAS contributions — the general salaried regime is uncapped.
- NEVER forget the employer's 26% CNAS share on top of the employee's 9%.
- NEVER add CACOBATPH 0.375% outside the construction / public-works sectors.
- NEVER state an exact IRG (G50) late-payment penalty — the precise figure is an unconfirmed research gap.
- NEVER pay or compute wages in a foreign currency — Algerian Dinars only.
- NEVER miss the monthly G50 (20th) / CNAS remittance or the 31 January DAS deadline.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Algerian expert-comptable.
