## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full financial year (1 July to 30 June), confirmation of ABN/TFN, and whether the taxpayer is an Australian resident.

**Recommended** -- all tax invoices issued, purchase receipts, PAYG payment summaries or income statements (via myGov), prior year tax return, BAS lodgments.

**Receipts and substantiation (critical)** -- for deduction claims, keep written evidence (receipt or tax invoice) showing supplier name, cost, date, and nature of expense, plus records of business-use apportionment. A bank or credit-card statement alone is generally not sufficient evidence. Keep records for at least 5 years from lodgment.

**Ideal** -- complete bookkeeping records, depreciation schedule, motor vehicle logbook, home office hours log, private health insurance statement, HELP debt balance.

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-AU-1 -- Companies and trusts** — Companies lodge company tax returns. Trusts lodge trust returns. This skill covers individual sole traders only.
- **R-AU-2 -- Non-residents** — Non-resident tax rates and rules differ significantly. Out of scope.
- **R-AU-3 -- Capital gains tax events** — CGT events require specialised computation (cost base, discounts, exemptions). Out of scope.
- **R-AU-4 -- Complex depreciation (effective life disputes)** — Where the ATO effective life is contested or the asset has no published rate, escalate.
- **R-AU-5 -- Partnership or PSI (Personal Services Income)** — PSI rules and partnership allocations require separate analysis. Escalate.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Standard Sole Trader (Graphic Designer)

**Input:** ABN income AUD 92,000. Business expenses: software AUD 3,600, advertising AUD 1,200, accounting AUD 1,100, office supplies AUD 800. Home office 1,200 hours at 70c/hr. Car 4,000 business km at 88c/km. No other income. No HELP debt. Has PHI.

**Computation:**
- Business income: AUD 92,000
- Expenses: 3,600 + 1,200 + 1,100 + 800 = AUD 6,700
- Home office: 1,200 x 0.70 = AUD 840
- Motor vehicle: 4,000 x 0.88 = AUD 3,520
- Total deductions: 6,700 + 840 + 3,520 = AUD 11,060
- Taxable income: 92,000 - 11,060 = AUD 80,940
- Tax: 0 + 4,288 + (80,940 - 45,000) x 30% = 4,288 + 10,782 = AUD 15,070
- Medicare: 80,940 x 2% = AUD 1,619
- LITO: $0 (income > $66,667)
- SBITO: 16% x (tax attributable to business income) -- business is 100% of income, so 16% x 15,070 = 2,411, capped at AUD 1,000
- Final tax: 15,070 + 1,619 - 1,000 = AUD 15,689

### Example 2 -- Instant Asset Write-Off

**Input:** Small business entity (turnover < $10M). Purchases laptop AUD 2,800 and monitor AUD 950. Both under $20,000.

**Classification:** Both items are immediately deductible under the instant asset write-off. Total deduction: AUD 3,750 in the year of purchase. No depreciation schedule needed.

### Example 3 -- Motor Vehicle (Logbook vs Cents/Km)

**Input:** Total km: 20,000. Business km: 12,000 (60%). Car costs: fuel AUD 4,800, insurance AUD 1,600, rego AUD 800, service AUD 1,200, depreciation AUD 4,000. Total AUD 12,400.

**Computation:**
- Cents/km: min(12,000, 5,000) x $0.88 = AUD 4,400 (capped at 5,000 km)
- Logbook: 12,400 x 60% = AUD 7,440
- Logbook method is significantly more beneficial. But requires a valid logbook kept for a continuous 12-week period.
- [T2] Flag: confirm logbook exists and is valid.

### Example 4 -- Home Office (Fixed Rate vs Actual)

**Input:** Works from home 1,600 hours/year. Dedicated office in 3-bedroom house (1/4 area). Electricity AUD 2,400, internet AUD 1,200, phone AUD 960 (80% business), depreciation on furniture AUD 400.

**Computation:**
- Fixed rate: 1,600 x $0.70 = AUD 1,120 (covers electricity, gas, phone, internet, stationery, computer consumables)
- Actual cost: electricity 1/4 x AUD 2,400 = AUD 600. Internet 80% x AUD 1,200 = AUD 960. Phone 80% x AUD 960 = AUD 768. Depreciation AUD 400. Total = AUD 2,728.
- Actual method is significantly better here.
- Under fixed rate: only computer/printer depreciation and occupancy expenses (rent, mortgage interest, rates, insurance) can be claimed additionally. Under actual: each item claimed individually.
- [T2] Flag: confirm method choice and occupancy costs if actual.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Business Income [T1]

- **Business income treatment** — All amounts derived from carrying on a business. If GST-registered, report net of GST. If not registered, report gross.  _(ITAA 1997 Div 6)_

### 5.2 General Deduction [T1]

- **General deduction** — A deduction for any loss or outgoing to the extent it is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income, or necessarily incurred in carrying on a business. Must not be private, domestic, or capital in nature.  _(ITAA 1997 s8-1)_

### 5.3 Depreciation [T1]

- **Diminishing value** — Base value x (days held / 365) x (200% / effective life)  _(ITAA 1997 Div 40)_
- **Prime cost (straight line)** — Cost x (days held / 365) x (100% / effective life)  _(ITAA 1997 Div 40)_
- **Small business entity simplified depreciation** — Small business entity (turnover < $10M): can use simplified depreciation -- pool all assets over $20,000 at 15% first year, 30% thereafter.  _(ITAA 1997 Div 40)_
- **Instant asset write-off** — Assets costing less than $20,000 can be immediately deducted by small business entities (aggregated turnover < $10m). The $20,000 limit is law for 2024-25 and 2025-26 (extended by the Treasury Laws Amendment (Strengthening Financial Systems and Other Measures) Act 2025), and the 2026-27 Budget announced it becomes **permanent from 1 July 2026** — confirm enactment before relying on it for 2026-27 purchases.  _(ITAA 1997 Div 328; ATO QC 103578)_

### 5.4 Superannuation [T1]

- **Personal deductible super contributions** — Personal deductible contributions up to $30,000 concessional cap (combined with employer contributions if also employed). Must lodge a valid "Notice of intent to claim" with the super fund AND receive acknowledgment BEFORE lodging the tax return or rolling over.

### 5.5 HELP/HECS Repayment [T1]

**5.5 HELP/HECS Repayment [T1]**

> **Regime change from 1 July 2025.** Compulsory repayments moved from a percentage of TOTAL repayment income to a **marginal system** — the repayment is calculated only on income above the minimum threshold. The old sliding-scale table (1%–10% from $54,435) applies to 2024-25 and earlier returns only. _(Student loan reforms passed November 2025; ATO QC 59241)_

| Repayment Income (2025-26) | Repayment on this income |
| --- | --- |
| $0 – $67,000 | Nil |
| $67,001 – $125,000 | 15c for each $1 over $67,000 |
| $125,001 – $179,285 | $8,700 plus 17c for each $1 over $125,000 |
| $179,286 and over | 10% of TOTAL repayment income |

| Repayment Income (2026-27) | Repayment on this income |
| --- | --- |
| $0 – $69,528 | Nil |
| $69,529 – $129,717 | 15c for each $1 over $69,528 |
| $129,718 – $186,050 | $9,028 plus 17c for each $1 over $129,717 |
| $186,051 and over | 10% of TOTAL repayment income |

- **Repayment income** — Repayment income = taxable income (excluding assessable FHSS released amounts) + reportable fringe benefits + total net investment loss + reportable super contributions + exempt foreign employment income. HELP repayments are NOT deductible.  _(Higher Education Support Act 2003; ATO QC 16176)_
- **Worked check (2025-26)** — repayment income $80,000 → 15% × ($80,000 − $67,000) = **$1,950** (old system would have been $2,800 at 3.5%).
- **One-off 20% debt reduction** — HELP/study loan balances outstanding at 1 June 2025 were automatically reduced by 20% (applied by the ATO from late 2025, processing completed by mid-2026; no action required). Confirm the client's current balance from ATO online services rather than an old statement.  _(studyassist.gov.au; ATO "Study and training loans – what's new", 30 June 2026)_
- **Indexation** — study loan indexation is now the LOWER of CPI and Wage Price Index (backdated to 1 June 2023 by the Universities Accord (Student Support and Other Measures) Act 2024).

### 5.6 Filing and Penalties [T1]

**5.6 Filing and Penalties [T1]**

| Shortfall penalty (recklessness) | 50% of shortfall |
| General Interest Charge (GIC) | Updated quarterly (TAA 1953 s 8AAD): 2025-26 quarters were 10.78%, 10.61%, 10.65%, 10.96%; Jul–Sep 2026 is 11.43%; calculated daily and compounded. **GIC and SIC incurred on or after 1 July 2025 are NOT tax-deductible** (Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Incentives and Integrity) Act 2025 Sch 2); remitted post-1-July-2025 GIC is not assessable, but remitted pre-1-July-2025 GIC that was deducted IS assessable |

Confirm PHI status and income level.

### 6.4 Personal Services Income (PSI) [T2]

- **PSI rules** — If income is mainly a reward for personal efforts/skills and not from conducting a personal services business, PSI rules limit deductions. Cannot claim rent, mortgage interest, certain home office costs against PSI.

Confirm whether PSI rules apply (results test, unrelated clients test, employment test, business premises test).
