# Australia Transfer Pricing

## Australia Transfer Pricing Skill v1.2

Australia Transfer Pricing Skill v1.2

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Australia (Commonwealth of Australia) |
| Tax authority | Australian Taxation Office (ATO) |
| Key TP legislation | Subdivision 815-B, Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997) |
| Documentation | Subdivision 284-E, Schedule 1, Taxation Administration Act 1953 (TAA 1953) |
| CbCR legislation | Subdivision 815-E ITAA 1997 |
| OECD member? | Yes |
| BEPS signatory? | Yes |
| Currency | AUD |
| Documentation language | English |
| Skill version | 1.2 |

## Section 2 -- Documentation Requirements

### 2.1 General Documentation (All Taxpayers)

**General Documentation (All Taxpayers)**

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Required? | Yes -- all taxpayers with international related-party dealings must keep records demonstrating arm's length conditions |
| Timing | Contemporaneous -- prepared before lodging income tax return |
| Penalty relevance | Without contemporaneous documentation, cannot establish "reasonably arguable position" (RAP) |

### 2.2 Three-Tier Documentation (Country-by-Country Reporting Entities)

**Three-Tier Documentation (Country-by-Country Reporting Entities)**

| Document | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Master File | OECD Annex I format; filed electronically |
| Local File | Australian-specific format (Short Form available for smaller dealings) |
| CbC Report | OECD Annex III format |
| Filing deadline | Within 12 months of end of income year |
| Filing method | Electronic lodgment with ATO |

- **CbC reporting scope:** Establish whether the entity is a CbC reporting entity for the relevant period under s 815-370, including group-income and accounting-consolidation rules, exclusions and any reporting exemption. SGE status alone does not settle CbC obligations. [ITAA 1997 s 815-370](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=PAC/19970038/815-370).

### 2.3 International Dealings Schedule (IDS)

**International Dealings Schedule (IDS)**

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Required? | Yes, for all taxpayers with material international related-party dealings |
| Filing | Annually with the corporate tax return |
| Content | Summary of related-party transactions, methods used, documentation status |

### 2.4 Short Form Local File

- **Short Form Local File:** Determine CbC reporting-entity status and apply the reporting-period ATO local-file instructions to identify which parts are required. Do not infer a reduced filing obligation from revenue or a general low-risk description alone. [ATO CbC reporting](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/international-tax-for-business/in-detail/transfer-pricing/country-by-country-reporting).

## Section 3 -- Arm's Length Standard

### 3.1 Definition

- **Arm's length standard definition** — Subdivision 815-B: Where conditions between entities in international dealings differ from arm's length conditions, and an entity gets a "transfer pricing benefit," the taxable income is adjusted to reflect arm's length conditions.  _(Subdivision 815-B ITAA 1997)_

### 3.2 Accepted Methods

**Accepted Methods**

| Method | Accepted |
| --- | --- |
| Comparable Uncontrolled Price (CUP) | Yes |
| Resale Price Method (RPM) | Yes |
| Cost Plus Method (CPM) | Yes |
| Transactional Net Margin Method (TNMM) | Yes |
| Profit Split Method (PSM) | Yes |
| Other reliable methods | Yes (method flexibility) |

### 3.3 Preferred Method

- **Preferred method approach** — No statutory hierarchy. ATO follows OECD "most appropriate method" approach. CUP preferred where reliable comparables exist.

### 3.4 Self-Assessment

- **Self-assessment system** — Australia operates a self-assessment system -- taxpayers must determine and apply arm's length conditions without prior ATO approval.

## Section 4 -- Filing Obligations

**Filing Obligations**

| Obligation | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| International Dealings Schedule (IDS) | Filed with income tax return |
| Master File (CbC reporting entities) | Electronic lodgment within 12 months of year-end |
| Local File (CbC reporting entities) | Electronic lodgment within 12 months of year-end |
| CbC Report (CbC reporting entities) | Electronic lodgment within 12 months of year-end |
| Reportable Tax Position (RTP) | Large taxpayers must disclose TP positions |
| Income tax return | Annual self-assessment |

## Section 5 -- Deadlines

**Deadlines**

| Item | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| TP documentation preparation | Before lodging income tax return |
| IDS filing | With income tax return (use the entity’s actual return due date) |
| Master/Local/CbC Report | 12 months after end of income year |
| Income tax return (companies) | Use the ATO lodgement programme for the entity, agent status and compliance history; no universal 15 January date |

## Section 6 -- Penalties

### 6.1 Transfer Pricing Shortfall Penalties

**Transfer Pricing Shortfall Penalties**

| Scenario | Penalty Rate |
| --- | --- |
| RAP established, no dominant tax purpose | 10% of scheme shortfall, before applicable adjustments |
| RAP established, dominant tax purpose | 25% of scheme shortfall, before applicable adjustments |
| No RAP, no dominant tax purpose | 25% of tax shortfall |
| No RAP, dominant tax purpose | 50% of tax shortfall |
| Uplift for repeat behaviour | Additional 20% |
| SGE adjustments | Apply the relevant statutory penalty provision; do not automatically double every transfer-pricing scheme-shortfall rate |

[ATO PS LA 2014/2](https://www.ato.gov.au/law/view/document?docid=PSR/PS20142/NAT/ATO/00001) explains transfer-pricing scheme-shortfall penalties. Contemporaneous documents are necessary for the statutory RAP treatment but do not guarantee a RAP or nil liability.

### 6.2 Documentation Impact

- **Documentation impact on RAP** — Without contemporaneous TP documentation prepared before lodging the return, a taxpayer is statutorily denied a reasonably arguable position.

### 6.3 Failure to Lodge (SGEs)

**Failure to Lodge (SGEs)**

| Offence | Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Failure to lodge Local File, Master File, or CbC Report | Up to $910,000 at the $364 penalty-unit value from 1 July 2026 where the five-unit, 500-times SGE rule applies; check dates, obligation and remission. [Crimes (Amount of a Penalty Unit) Instrument 2026](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2026N00424/asmade/text) |
| Shortfall interest charge | Applies on underpaid tax |

| Low-level inbound/outbound loans | Interest-rate safe harbours available (PCG guidance) |
| Small taxpayers (turnover < AUD 50m) | Low-risk dealings may have simplified documentation |
| Distributors with limited related-party dealings | Materiality-based simplification |
| Management/technical services | Threshold-based simplification |
