## Australia -- Payroll Skill v1.0

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Australia (Commonwealth of Australia) |
| Currency | AUD ($) only |
| Tax year (income year) | 1 July -- 30 June |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992; Fair Work Act 2009 |

| Skill version | 2.0 |

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (PAYG)

PAYG withholding is calculated per pay period using ATO tax tables (Schedule 1 -- NAT 1004) or the Statement of Formulas. The employer applies the appropriate coefficients based on weekly/fortnightly/monthly earnings.

### Resident Individual Tax Rates (2026--27)

**Resident Individual Tax Rates (2025--26)**

| Taxable Income (AUD) | Rate | Tax on This Income |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 18,200 | 0% | Nil |
| 18,201 -- 45,000 | 15% | 15c for each $1 over $18,200 |
| 45,001 -- 135,000 | 30% | $4,020 plus 30c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| 135,001 -- 190,000 | 37% | $31,020 plus 37c for each $1 over $135,000 |
| 190,001+ | 45% | $51,370 plus 45c for each $1 over $190,000 |

These rates **exclude** the Medicare levy (2%). From 1 July 2026 the rate on $18,201--$45,000 dropped from 16% to 15% (Treasury Laws Amendment (More Cost of Living Relief) Act 2025); it drops again to 14% from 1 July 2027.

### Medicare Levy

**Medicare Levy**

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Standard rate | 2% of taxable income |
| Low-income threshold (single) | No levy up to $28,011; reduced levy $28,012--$35,014 |
| Low-income threshold (family) | No levy up to $47,238; reduced $47,239--$59,048 |
| Medicare Levy Surcharge | 1.0%--1.5% additional for high earners without private hospital cover |

- **Medicare levy incorporation** — The Medicare levy is incorporated into PAYG withholding calculations via the tax tables.

### Tax File Number (TFN) Declaration

- **TFN declaration requirement** — Every new employee must complete a TFN declaration. If no TFN is provided, withhold at the top marginal rate (45% + Medicare levy = 47%) from the first dollar.

### Study and Training Support Loans (STSL)

- **STSL description** — Formerly HECS-HELP. Compulsory repayments are withheld via PAYG based on Schedule 8 thresholds. Updated STSL repayment thresholds apply from 24 September 2025, reducing compulsory repayments for most borrowers.

## Section 3 -- Social Security: Employee Deductions

Australia does not have a separate employee social security contribution. The Medicare levy (2%) serves a similar function but is collected through PAYG withholding, not as a separate line item.

### Employee-Side Deductions Summary

**Employee-Side Deductions Summary**

| Deduction | Rate | Ceiling | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PAYG income tax | Progressive (see above) | No ceiling | Includes Medicare levy in tax tables |
| STSL repayment | 1%--10% (income-based) | No ceiling | Only if employee has HELP/STSL debt |
| Salary sacrifice (super) | Voluntary | Concessional cap $32,500/year (2026-27) | Pre-tax; reduces PAYG withholding base |

There is no employee-paid social insurance premium equivalent to NIC (UK) or social security tax (US).

## Section 4 -- Social Security: Employer Contributions

### Superannuation Guarantee (SG) -- Payday Super from 1 July 2026

| Parameter | 2026--27 Value |
|---|---|
| SG rate | 12% of qualifying earnings |
| Maximum contribution base | $270,830 per year (ANNUAL, year-to-date basis; quarterly base abolished for earnings paid from 1 Jul 2026) |
| Minimum earnings threshold | Abolished (no $450/month threshold from 1 Jul 2022) |
| Payment deadline | Received by the employee's fund within **7 business days of each payday** (clearing house receipt does not count) |
| Eligible employees | All employees 18+; under-18s working 30+ hours/week |

**Deadline exceptions:** new employee / new fund -- 20 business days for the first contribution; out-of-cycle payments (bonuses) ride with the next regular payday's deadline; ATO exceptional-circumstances determinations -- 20 business days.

**Legacy:** quarterly due dates (28 Oct/28 Jan/28 Apr/28 Jul) apply only to earnings paid up to 30 June 2026; the final quarterly deadline was 28 July 2026. The ATO Small Business Super Clearing House closed permanently on 1 July 2026 -- small employers now use payroll-software super payments or commercial clearing houses.

12% is the final scheduled SG rate (reached 1 July 2025). No further increases are planned.

### Superannuation Guarantee Charge (SGC) -- redesigned from 1 July 2026

For earnings paid from 1 July 2026, SGC is **ATO-assessed per payday** (no SGC statement is lodged; the ATO matches STP data against fund reporting). Components:
- The final SG shortfall (12% of qualifying earnings unpaid)
- Notional earnings (GIC-rate interest, compounding daily from the day after the deadline)
- An administrative uplift (starts at 60% of shortfall + notional earnings; reduced for clean history and voluntary disclosure, to 0% if disclosed within 30 days with a clean 2-year record)
- Choice loading (25%, capped at $1,200 per notice period) where choice-of-fund rules were breached

The redesigned SGC **is tax-deductible** (GIC on late SGC and the late payment penalty are not). Old-regime SGC for quarters before 1 July 2026 remains non-deductible. Unpaid SGC 28 days after assessment triggers a Notice to Pay, then a 25% or 50% late payment penalty. First-year ATO approach: PCG 2026/1.

### Workers' Compensation Insurance

- **Workers' compensation insurance** — Mandatory in all states/territories. Premium rates vary by industry, state, and claims history. Typically 1%--5% of wages for office-based roles.

### Payroll Tax (State/Territory)

**Payroll Tax (State/Territory)**

| State/Territory | Threshold (Annual) | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NSW | $1,200,000 | 4.85% |
| VIC | $900,000 | 4.85% |
| QLD | $1,300,000 | 4.75% |
| WA | $1,000,000 | 5.50% |
| SA | $1,500,000 | Varies (0%--4.95%) |
| TAS | $1,250,000 | 4.00% |
| ACT | $2,000,000 | 6.85% |
| NT | $1,500,000 | 5.50% |

- **Payroll tax nature** — Payroll tax is a state/territory tax on total Australian wages above the threshold. Interstate employers must register in each jurisdiction where they have employees.

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage and Overtime

### National Minimum Wage (from 1 July 2025)

**National Minimum Wage (from 1 July 2025)**

| Category | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| Adult (full-time, 38 hrs/week) | $24.95/hour ($948.10/week) |
| Junior rates | Percentage of adult rate by age (under awards) |
| Casual loading | 25% on top of base rate (in lieu of leave entitlements) |

- **Modern award coverage** — Most employees are covered by a modern award, which sets higher minimum rates by classification level.

### Overtime (Under Awards)

**Overtime (Under Awards)**

| Period | Typical Award Rate |
| --- | --- |
| First 2 hours overtime (Mon--Sat) | 150% (time and a half) |
| After 2 hours overtime | 200% (double time) |
| Sunday work | 200% |
| Public holiday work | 250% |

- **Overtime rate variability** — Exact rates depend on the applicable modern award or enterprise agreement. The Fair Work Act does not prescribe a single universal overtime rate.

### Maximum Ordinary Hours

### Public Holidays

- **Public holidays entitlement** — 8 national public holidays. Additional state/territory-specific holidays. Employees (except casuals) are entitled to be absent on public holidays without loss of pay.

### Redundancy Pay (NES)

| --- | --- |
| 1--2 years | 4 weeks |
| 2--3 years | 6 weeks |

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1 -- Full-Time Monthly Employee

Annual salary $85,000. Paid monthly. No STSL debt.

1. Monthly gross: $85,000 ÷ 12 = $7,083.33
2. PAYG withholding: per Schedule 1 tax table coefficients (~$1,475/month incl. Medicare, 2026-27 rates)
3. Super guarantee: $7,083.33 × 12% = $850.00 (employer cost, received by the fund within 7 business days of the payday)
4. Net pay: $7,083.33 - $1,475.00 - deductions

### Pattern 2 -- Casual Employee with Loading

Base rate $28.50/hour under award. Casual loading 25% = $35.63/hour. Works 25 hours.

1. Gross: 25 × $35.63 = $890.75
2. PAYG: per weekly tax table for $890.75
3. Super: $890.75 × 12% = $106.89 (employer cost)
4. No leave accrual (casual loading compensates)

### Pattern 3 -- Employee with Salary Sacrifice to Super

Annual salary $120,000. Sacrifices $10,000/year to super.

1. Taxable salary: $110,000 (reduced PAYG base)
2. Employer SG: $120,000 × 12% = $14,400 (calculated on pre-sacrifice OTE)
3. Concessional super cap: $32,500 (2026-27) (includes SG $14,400 + sacrifice $10,000 = $24,400; within cap)
4. The $10,000 is taxed at 15% inside the super fund instead of the employee's marginal rate

### Pattern 4 -- STSL Repayment

Employee earning $65,000 with HELP debt. STSL repayment rate from Schedule 8 tables: approximately 4.5%. Annual repayment: $65,000 × 4.5% = $2,925, withheld progressively via PAYG.
