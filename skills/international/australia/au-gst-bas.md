## Section 2 — Filing requirements

### 2.1 Who must lodge a BAS

- **Activity-statement lodgement obligation** — Lodgement depends on the entity's tax roles, reporting method and the form the ATO issues. Lodge each required BAS or activity statement by its due date. Quarterly Forms R (PAYG instalment), S (GST instalment) and T (PAYG and GST instalment) generally need only be lodged when varying the instalment amount.  _([ATO — activity statements and nil lodgments](https://www.ato.gov.au/api/public/content/0-0b929c4e-ddac-4b4f-a627-7427575b94a2))_

## Section 4 — Computation rules

### 4.1 PAYG withholding (labels W1-W5)

- **PAYG withholding computation steps** — **Step 1.** Identify the payments and withholding labels that apply during the period: - W1 — total salary, wages and other payments subject to withholding, where W1 must be completed; - W2 — amounts withheld from the payments shown at W1; - W3 — other amounts withheld; - W4 — amounts withheld where an ABN was not quoted; and - W5 — total amounts withheld: W2 + W3 + W4. **Step 2.** Reconcile the labels that the entity must report on its issued activity statement with payroll records, STP data and any ATO pre-fill. A small or medium withholder reporting through STP does not need to separately report W1; complete W2, W3, W4 and W5 where applicable. A large withholder that does not report through STP completes only W1; a large withholder reporting through STP does not report PAYG withholding on its activity statement. Large withholders do not complete W2, W3, W4, W5 or label 4 and must pay withheld amounts electronically on the applicable large-withholder schedule. **Step 3.** Where W2 applies, cross-check it against ATO PAYG withholding tax tables for each employee's earnings level. **Step 4.** If the entity makes payments to a supplier without an ABN, withhold 47% and account for that amount under the reporting and payment rules for the entity's withholding class. **Step 5.** Where W5 applies, report the W2 + W3 + W4 total and pay the amount due by the applicable due date.  _([ATO — PAYG withholding](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/preparing-lodging-and-paying/business-activity-statements-bas/pay-as-you-go-payg-withholding); [ATO — PAYG withholding pre-fill for activity statements](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/hiring-and-paying-your-workers/single-touch-payroll/stp-and-activity-statements/ato-payg-withholding-pre-fill-for-activity-statements); [ATO — changes to PAYG withholding cycles](https://www.ato.gov.au/api/public/content/0-a1d50fe2-efe7-4866-9d51-855fd171ac74))_

### 4.2 PAYG income tax instalments (labels T1-T9)

Two methods are available:

#### Method A — Instalment amount method (label T7)

- **Instalment amount method steps** — Use the notified T7 amount unless varying. For a standard quarterly amount variation, enter estimated annual tax at T8; calculate the cumulative 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% share for the quarter, subtracting earlier instalments and applying the form’s treatment of earlier credits; enter the varied amount at T9, reason at T4 and payable amount at 5A. A zero or negative result needs the ATO credit instructions, including 5B where applicable. Do not divide annual tax by the remaining quarters. Example: at the third standard quarterly instalment, an annual estimate of $8,000 gives a cumulative $6,000 target (75%). If earlier instalments total $3,000 and there are no earlier credits, the current varied amount is $3,000. This is not $8,000 divided by two remaining quarters. Follow the ATO variation instructions above.  _([ATO PAYG variation instructions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/how-to-vary-your-payg-instalments))_

#### Method B — Instalment rate method (labels T1-T2)

- **Instalment rate method steps** — Establish instalment income at T1 and the notified rate at T2. If varying, enter the new rate at T3 and reason at T4. Multiply T1 by the applicable rate and enter the result at T11 and 5A as instructed. Exclude salary, GST and capital gains from T1. Check the variation shortfall and GIC rules.  _([ATO PAYG variation instructions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/how-to-vary-your-payg-instalments))_
- **Rate-method formula** — T11 = T1 × applicable percentage rate, using T3 if validly varied, otherwise T2. Follow the issued statement for 5A.  _([ATO PAYG variation instructions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/how-to-vary-your-payg-instalments))_

### 4.3 FBT instalment (label F1)

- **FBT instalment computation steps** — **Step 1.** If the taxpayer has an FBT instalment obligation, the ATO pre-fills label F1 with 25% of the prior year FBT liability. **Step 2.** The taxpayer may vary the instalment if FBT liability is expected to be lower. **Step 3.** Report at F1. The annual FBT return (due 21 May for non-tax-agent lodgement or 25 June for tax agents) reconciles the actual liability.  _(TAA 1953 Sch 1 s 45-400)_

### 4.4 Net BAS payable / refundable

- **Net BAS payable** — Sum the completed payment labels, including 1A, 4, 5A and 6A as applicable; subtract credit labels including 1B, 5B and 6B. Use the statement’s total labels and exclude amounts, such as large-withholder payments, paid separately. Do not treat an annual estimate at T8 as a tax payment.

## Section 5 — Edge cases and special rules

### 5.1 Variation of PAYG instalments

- **PAYG instalment variation and GIC** — Apply the ATO’s method-specific 85% shortfall test to a variation using expected full-year income and tax. Document the estimate and review it as circumstances change. Repeated variations do not themselves change the published GDP adjustment factor.  _([ATO PAYG variation instructions](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/how-to-vary-your-payg-instalments))_

### 5.2 First year of business

- **Starting PAYG instalments / first-year businesses** — The ATO works out automatic entry from information in the latest tax return. It notifies the taxpayer when they enter the PAYG instalments system, and payments start once it sends an activity statement or instalment notice. A person new to business can request voluntary entry. Under Schedule 1 section 45-15 of the Taxation Administration Act 1953, an entity is liable to pay instalments if the Commissioner has given it an instalment rate in writing.  _([ATO — Starting PAYG instalments](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/starting-payg-instalments); [TAA 1953 Sch 1 s 45-15](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C1953A00001/2026-07-01/2026-07-01/text/original/epub/OEBPS/document_2/document_2.html#_Toc235715860))_

### 5.3 STP and BAS alignment

- **STP and BAS labels** — Reporting through STP does not cancel activity-statement obligations arising from GST, PAYG instalments or other tax roles. An STP-reporting small or medium withholder does not need to separately report W1; complete the other PAYG-withholding labels required by the issued activity statement. Different reporting and payment rules apply to large withholders. ATO Online Services may pre-fill W1 and W2 from STP information for eligible electronic activity statements; use payroll records as the primary source, then verify and correct any pre-filled figures. For a small employer with 19 or fewer payees, in-scope payments to closely held payees may be reported through STP quarterly, but arm's-length payees must still be reported on or before payday. That timing concession does not itself remove BAS obligations.  _([ATO — PAYG withholding](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/preparing-lodging-and-paying/business-activity-statements-bas/pay-as-you-go-payg-withholding); [ATO — PAYG withholding pre-fill for activity statements](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/hiring-and-paying-your-workers/single-touch-payroll/stp-and-activity-statements/ato-payg-withholding-pre-fill-for-activity-statements); [ATO — changes to PAYG withholding cycles](https://www.ato.gov.au/api/public/content/0-a1d50fe2-efe7-4866-9d51-855fd171ac74); [ATO — STP reporting for closely held payees](https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Single-Touch-Payroll/Concessional-reporting/Closely-held-payees/))_

### 5.4 Ceasing PAYG instalments

- **Stopping PAYG instalments** — For individuals, the ATO will automatically remove a taxpayer if one of its published automatic-exit conditions is met; this includes an estimated (notional) tax liability of less than $500. That threshold is an automatic-exit condition, not a standalone self-exit test. An individual who is no longer earning business or investment income may request to exit, subject to the ATO's eligibility requirements and listed exclusions. Individuals can request exit through myGov: **Tax > Manage > Tax registrations > Cancel** (the option is available only when eligible), through a registered tax agent, or by contacting the ATO. If the Commissioner withdraws the instalment rate, the entity ceases to be liable to pay further instalments.  _([ATO — Stopping PAYG instalments](https://www.ato.gov.au/businesses-and-organisations/income-deductions-and-concessions/payg-instalments/stopping-payg-instalments); [TAA 1953 Sch 1 s 45-90](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C1953A00001/2026-07-01/2026-07-01/text/original/epub/OEBPS/document_2/document_2.html#_Toc235715874))_

### 5.5 Nil BAS / activity statement

- **Nil lodgment and FTL exposure** — If an entity has nothing to report for a BAS period but is required to lodge the BAS, it must lodge it as nil by the due date. A business that has paused trading but keeps its GST registration continues to receive a BAS and must lodge it as nil. Do not assume every zero-value activity-statement notice has that obligation: the ATO says quarterly Forms R (PAYG instalment), S (GST instalment) and T (PAYG and GST instalment) generally need only be lodged when varying the instalment amount. If a required BAS is not given to the Commissioner in approved form by its due date, the entity may be liable to an FTL administrative penalty. The base amount is one penalty unit for each 28-day period (or part) for which it remains outstanding, capped at five units; statutory multipliers apply to specified medium, large and significant-global entities. The Commissioner may remit all or part of the penalty. Use the applicable penalty-unit value for the relevant period, rather than a static tax-year dollar figure.  _([ATO — nil activity-statement guidance](https://www.ato.gov.au/api/public/content/0-0b929c4e-ddac-4b4f-a627-7427575b94a2); [ATO — paused business and nil BAS](https://www.ato.gov.au/api/public/content/0-8551e46a-7b10-44c9-b5b4-7fc8bd0c32d5); [TAA 1953 Sch 1 ss 286-75, 286-80 and 298-20](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C1953A00001/2026-07-01/2026-07-01/text/original/epub/OEBPS/document_2/document_2.html); [Crimes (Amount of a Penalty Unit) Instrument 2026](https://www.legislation.gov.au/F2026N00424/asmade/2026-06-16/text/original/epub/OEBPS/document_1/document_1.html))_
