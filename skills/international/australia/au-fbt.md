# Australia Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) -- Employer Skill v1.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything. The FBT year is 1 April - 31 March, NOT the income year.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Australia |
| Primary Legislation | Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (FBTAA) |
| Tax Authority | Australian Taxation Office (ATO) |
| FBT Year | Ending 31 March 2027 (1 April 2026 -- 31 March 2027) |
| Currency | AUD only |
| FBT rate | 47% |
| Type 1 gross-up (provider entitled to GST credit) | 2.0802 |
| Type 2 gross-up (no GST credit entitlement) | 1.8868 |
| Return due -- self-preparer, or tax agent lodging on paper | 21 May 2027 (lodge and pay) |
| Return due -- tax agent lodging electronically | 25 June 2027 (client must be on the agent's FBT list by 21 May 2027) |
| Quarterly instalments | Required in the next year if prior-year FBT liability was $3,000 or more (via activity statements) |
| Record-keeping exemption (base-year aggregate) | $10,962 (year ending 31 March 2027; 20% growth condition -- Rule 12) |
| Car statutory formula rate | 20% flat (post-10 May 2011 commitments) |
| Operating cost deemed depreciation / deemed interest | 25% diminishing value / 8.27% |
| Car parking daily fee threshold | $11.48 |
| Minor benefits exemption | Notional taxable value < $300 AND infrequent/irregular (s 58P) |
| RFBA trigger | Individual fringe benefits amount > $2,000 -> report x 1.8868 via STP (exclusions apply -- Rule 9) |
| EV exemption | Battery electric / hydrogen cars still exempt (conditions apply); **PHEVs NOT exempt from 1 April 2025** except grandfathered binding commitments; announced wind-back from 1 April 2027, not yet law -- Rule 5 |
| Contributor | Open Accountants |
| Validated by | Pending |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown GST creditability of a benefit | Ask -- decides Type 1 vs Type 2 gross-up; never assume Type 1 |
| Unknown car method election | Compute both statutory formula and operating cost where a logbook exists; use statutory if no logbook |
| Unknown logbook or odometer records | Assume NO valid logbook/odometer set (statutory formula applies); flag |
| PHEV in the fleet | Assume NOT exempt (post-1 April 2025) unless a pre-1-April-2025 binding commitment is evidenced |
| Unknown employee contribution | Assume nil; ask |
| Entertainment attendee split unknown | Flag -- actual method needs the employee/non-employee split |
| Not-for-profit employer | STOP -- capping/rebate rules out of scope (R-AU-FBT-1) |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- entity type and FBT registration status, GL for the FBT year (1 April - 31 March), motor vehicle list with cost/dates/users, entertainment account detail, any salary packaging arrangements.

**Recommended** -- logbooks and odometer records, employee contribution records, declarations (or alternative records under the 1 April 2024 measures), prior year FBT return and workpapers, lease agreements for novated/associate leases.

**Ideal** -- per-employee benefit register, car parking market surveys, LAFH declarations and expense evidence, loan agreements with rates and balances.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-AU-FBT-1 -- NFP capping and rebates.** *Trigger:* employer is a PBI, health promotion charity, public/not-for-profit hospital, or rebatable employer. *Message:* "Salary packaging caps ($30,000/$17,000 grossed-up; $15,900/$9,010 in benefit value), meal entertainment card arrangements and the FBT rebate are specialist territory. Out of scope -- escalate."

**R-AU-FBT-2 -- Employee share schemes.** *Trigger:* benefit involves shares/options. *Message:* "ESS interests are generally excluded from FBT and taxed under ESS rules. Out of scope."

**R-AU-FBT-3 -- Car parking commercial valuation.** *Trigger:* car parking benefits arise and a taxable value beyond the threshold test is needed. *Message:* "Commercial parking station rate selection, market valuation, and the statutory spaces method involve valuation judgment. Compute exposure flag only; escalate valuation."

**R-AU-FBT-4 -- Airline transport, board, remote area housing.** *Trigger:* these benefit categories appear. *Message:* "Specialised valuation rules. Out of scope -- escalate."

## Section 3 -- GL sweep library

FBT work starts with a ledger sweep, not a form. These are the account patterns that hide benefits.

### 3.1 High-yield accounts

| GL account pattern | Likely benefit | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Motor vehicle -- fuel, rego, insurance, repairs, lease | Car fringe benefit | Build the car register (Section 5, Rules 3-4) |
| Entertainment, staff amenities, sundry expenses | Meal entertainment / minor benefits | Split sustenance vs entertainment; attendee analysis |
| Staff gifts, staff welfare | Property/minor benefits | $300 minor test per gift (s 58P) |
| Travel -- accommodation and meals | Travelling vs LAFH boundary | Apply PCG 2021/3 safe harbour (T2-4) |
| Employee reimbursements | Expense payment benefits | Otherwise-deductible check + declaration |
| Loans to employees / directors' loan accounts (debit) | Loan benefit | Compare rate charged to 8.27% benchmark (also check Div 7A for shareholders -- separate regime) |
| Gym/health/wellness, club memberships | Expense payment / residual | Rarely exempt; work-related-item test fails for these |
| Phone/laptop purchases for staff | Possibly exempt s 58X | Portable device, primarily work use; one-per-year rule unless small business (Rule 10 -- NOTE rules change 1 April 2027) |

### 3.2 Sustenance vs entertainment (the perennial misclassification)

| Fact pattern | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Morning tea, biscuits, sandwiches consumed on premises during work | Sustenance -- NOT entertainment, no FBT, deductible |
| Meal with alcohol, restaurant, off-site | Entertainment -- FBT analysis required |
| Coffee with a client (light, on business) | Likely sustenance/marginal -- flag, err to entertainment if elaborate |
| Christmas party, staff drinks | Entertainment -- minor benefit test per head if < $300 and infrequent |
| Meal while travelling overnight for work | Not entertainment for the traveller -- travel expense |

---

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Car fringe benefit, statutory formula

Car cost $40,000 (GST-inclusive base value), available for private use all 365 days of the year ending 31 March 2027, employee contributed $1,000 after tax. The employer is GST-registered and claimed the GST credit on the car's acquisition.

```
Taxable value = 20% x $40,000 x (365/365) - $1,000 = $7,000
GST credit entitlement established above -> Type 1 (established, never assumed)
Grossed-up = $7,000 x 2.0802 = $14,561.40
FBT = 47% x $14,561.40 = $6,843.86
```

Employee contribution is assessable income to the employer and has GST consequences.

### Example 2 -- Exempt EV that still creates RFBA

Battery electric car, first held and used March 2024, LCT value at first retail sale below the fuel-efficient LCT threshold for that year so LCT was never payable (verified from the sale documents, not a raw price comparison), provided to a current employee through 2026-27.

Car benefit and associated expenses (rego, insurance, servicing, charging): **exempt** -- no FBT. But the **notional** taxable value must still be computed: if it exceeds $2,000 for the employee, an RFBA is reported through STP (notional TV x 1.8868). Home charging may use the PCG 2024/2 shortcut: 5.47 c/km for the FBT year starting 1 April 2026.

### Example 3 -- The PHEV trap

Plug-in hybrid delivered under a novated lease commencing 1 June 2025. NOT exempt -- PHEVs ceased qualifying 1 April 2025, and the lease began after that date, so no grandfathering. Full car fringe benefit applies. (Grandfathering needs BOTH pre-1-April-2025 exempt use AND a binding commitment spanning the date; optional lease extensions break it.)

### Example 4 -- Christmas party under the minor benefits exemption

Off-site Christmas party, $180 per head including partners, once a year. Per-attendee notional taxable value < $300 and the event is infrequent -> minor benefit, exempt (s 58P). Consequence of exemption: the cost is NOT income tax deductible and no GST credits (entertainment is only deductible/creditable to the extent FBT applies).

### Example 5 -- Meal entertainment, 50/50 election

Total meal entertainment for the year $28,000 across staff and clients, no register kept, employer elects 50/50.

```
Taxable value = 50% x $28,000 = $14,000 (attendee split irrelevant under 50/50)
Only 50% of the spend is income tax deductible (s 51AEA); GST credits follow the same 50%
```

Compare before electing: actual method may beat 50/50 when client (non-employee) share is high; the register method needs a 12-week register. Salary-packaged meal entertainment MUST use the actual method.

### Example 6 -- Loan benefit

$50,000 interest-free loan to an employee outstanding all year.

```
Notional interest = $50,000 x 8.27% (benchmark, year ending 31 Mar 2027) = $4,135
Interest charged = $0 -> taxable value = $4,135 (Type 2 -> x 1.8868)
```

If the employee would have deducted the interest (e.g. loan used for their income-producing investment), the otherwise-deductible rule can reduce the taxable value -- declaration required.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

### Rule 1 -- FBT liability formula

```
FBT payable = 47% x [ (sum of Type 1 taxable values x 2.0802) + (sum of Type 2 taxable values x 1.8868) ]
```

Type 1 where the provider is entitled to a GST credit on providing the benefit; Type 2 otherwise (GST-free/input-taxed supplies, provider not registered). Never assume Type 1.

### Rule 2 -- Return and payment dates (2027 FBT year)

Self-preparers and paper-lodging agents: lodge and pay by 21 May 2027. Agents lodging electronically: 25 June 2027, client must be on the agent's FBT client list by 21 May 2027 -- a client added after 21 May reverts to the 21 May due date (already late if unlodged). Prior-year liability >= $3,000 -> quarterly instalments next year via activity statements.

### Rule 3 -- Car statutory formula

```
Taxable value = 20% x base value x (days available for private use / days in FBT year) - employee contributions
```

Base value = GST-inclusive cost including luxury car tax and non-business accessories fitted at acquisition (less registration/stamp duty), reduced by one-third from the first FBT year commencing after the fourth anniversary of the date the car was first held by the employer or an associate (once only; holding need not be continuous; the reduction never applies to non-business accessories added after acquisition). 20% applies to all post-10-May-2011 commitments. A car garaged at or near the employee's home is taken to be available for private use.

### Rule 4 -- Car operating cost method

```
Taxable value = total operating costs x private-use percentage - employee contributions
```

Operating costs include actual running costs PLUS deemed depreciation (25% diminishing value on the depreciated value, cars held from 10 May 2006) and deemed interest (8.27% for the year ending 31 March 2027) for owned cars. Business percentage requires a valid logbook: continuous 12-week representative period, valid 5 years, plus full-year odometer records. No valid logbook -> statutory formula. Employer may choose per car, per year, whichever gives the lower value.

### Rule 5 -- Electric vehicle exemption (and its edges)

Exempt if ALL: battery electric or hydrogen fuel cell car (PHEVs excluded from 1 April 2025 -- see below); designed to carry < 1 tonne and < 9 passengers (motorcycles/scooters never qualify); first held AND used on or after 1 July 2022; used by a current employee or their associates; luxury car tax has NEVER been payable on any supply or importation -- check whether LCT was actually payable from the sale documents (the car's LCT value against the fuel-efficient threshold for the financial year of the relevant sale; $91,661 for 2026-27 sales), never by raw price comparison. Associated running costs are also exempt. **The exempt benefit still generates an RFBA** via notional taxable value (Rule 9). PHEV grandfathering: exempt use before 1 April 2025 plus a financially binding commitment continuing on and after that date; optional extensions are not binding. **Transition warning -- ANNOUNCED, NOT YET LAW:** the 2026-27 Budget (5 May 2026) winds the exemption back from 1 April 2027: full exemption retained only for electric cars costing $75,000 or less (0% statutory formula rate); cars above $75,000 but below the LCT threshold get a 25% discount on FBT payable (15% statutory formula rate); from 1 April 2029 all eligible electric cars drop to the 25% discount. Existing leases are grandfathered. The current exemption runs unchanged to 31 March 2027. Flag any new EV novated lease commencing on or after 1 April 2027 and verify enactment status (ato.gov.au new legislation QC 107286) before advising -- this is an announcement only, not enacted law.

### Rule 6 -- Car parking

A car parking benefit needs, on the same day: parking > 4 hours between 7am-7pm on employer premises at/near the primary place of employment; the employee's car parked and commuting use; AND at least one commercial parking station within 1 km that charged a lowest representative fee for all-day parking above $11.48 on the first business day of the FBT year (1 April 2026 for the 2027 year -- no on-the-day fee test exists). Small business exemption: parking is not at a commercial car park AND (gross total income < $10m OR aggregated turnover < $50m) AND not a government body or listed company. Valuation beyond the threshold check: escalate (R-AU-FBT-3).

### Rule 7 -- Minor benefits (s 58P)

Notional taxable value < $300 (not indexed; per benefit, per occasion) AND unreasonable to treat as a fringe benefit having regard to infrequency/irregularity and the other s 58P(1)(f) criteria (TR 2007/12: no fixed number of occasions). Screening heuristic: quarterly or less frequent = presumptively infrequent; monthly or more = flag for review. Exempt entertainment gets no deduction and no GST credit.

### Rule 8 -- Meal entertainment methods

1. **Actual** (default; MANDATORY for salary-packaged meal entertainment): taxable value = amounts for employees/associates; client share not subject to FBT (and not deductible).
2. **50/50 split** (Division 9A election): 50% of ALL meal entertainment is the taxable value, regardless of attendees; only 50% deductible/GST-creditable (s 51AEA).
3. **12-week register**: register percentage applied to the year's spend.

The minor benefits exemption is NOT available for meal entertainment once a 50/50 or register election is made -- it applies only under the actual method. Entertainment is income-tax deductible and GST-creditable ONLY to the extent it is a fringe benefit subject to FBT.

### Rule 9 -- Employee contributions and RFBA

Contributions: after-tax only, reduce the taxable value of THAT benefit only (no cross-application; not for tax-exempt body entertainment), are assessable income to the employer, and carry GST consequences. RFBA: computed on the employee's INDIVIDUAL fringe benefits amount, which EXCLUDES car parking benefits, meal entertainment not provided under a salary packaging arrangement (50/50 and register amounts are never allocable to employees), pooled/shared cars, and remote-area concessions -- and INCLUDES the notional value of exempt electric car benefits (the exception running the other way). Where that amount exceeds $2,000 for the FBT year, report it x 1.8868 (always the Type 2 factor, in whole dollars) through STP finalisation. RFBA affects the employee's income tests, not their taxable income.

### Rule 10 -- Otherwise-deductible rule and declarations

Expense payment/property/residual/loan benefits: taxable value reduced by what the employee could have claimed as a once-only deduction. Requires a declaration in the approved form before the declaration date -- or, from 1 April 2024, adequate alternative records per the Commissioner's legislative instruments (available for 11 record types; logbooks and odometer records still need the approved form). Portable electronic devices (s 58X): exempt if primarily for work; one substantially-identical item per year unless a replacement, or the employer's aggregated turnover is under $50 million. **Transition warning:** from 1 April 2027, Act No 49 of 2026 (Sch 4 Pt 2) removes the one-per-year limit and the turnover carve-out, denies s 58X entirely for items provided under a salary packaging arrangement, and (new s 24(1A)) blocks the otherwise-deductible rule for salary-packaged expense payments of standard-deduction work expenses -- flag any packaging arrangement extending past 31 March 2027.

### Rule 11 -- LAFHA (standard cases only)

Concessional LAFHA treatment: employee maintains an Australian home they're living away from, first 12 months at a location (FIFO/DIDO excepted from both), declaration held. Exempt food component limited to the reasonable amounts in TD 2026/2 (year ending 31 March 2027: $353/week one adult within Australia; $530 two adults; statutory food amount $42/week adult, $21/week child under 12 deducted first). Within reasonable amounts -> no substantiation of food; above -> full substantiation. Travelling-vs-LAFH boundary: MT 2030's 21-day rule is WITHDRAWN; TR 2021/4 governs, with PCG 2021/3 safe harbour (<= 21 continuous days away and < 90 days at one location in the year) the practical screen.

### Rule 12 -- Record-keeping exemption and loan benchmark

Record-keeping exemption (Pt XIA): an employer with a base year (return lodged, full records kept) whose aggregate fringe benefits amount was <= $10,962 may stop keeping records and pay FBT on the base-year amount -- unless the current year's aggregate exceeds the base-year amount by more than 20%, in which case current-year liability applies and records are needed. In-house benefits (s 62): aggregate taxable value reduced by $1,000 per employee per year; not available for salary-packaged benefits. Loan benefits: taxable value = benchmark rate (8.27%) minus rate actually charged, on the outstanding balance. The benchmark and car-parking figures now publish ONLY on the ATO rates page -- TDs are issued only for cents-per-km and LAFHA food amounts.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

### T2-1 -- Not-for-profit capping regimes

**Trigger:** rebatable employer / PBI / hospital. **Action:** Refuse per R-AU-FBT-1; specialist review.

### T2-2 -- Grandfathered PHEV commitments

**Trigger:** PHEV claimed exempt in 2026-27. **Issue:** needs pre-1-April-2025 exempt use AND a binding commitment; refinancing or optional extensions break it. **Action:** obtain the lease/commitment documents; flag for reviewer.

**Note -- announced, not yet law:** the EV exemption itself narrows for arrangements from 1 April 2027 (Rule 5 transition warning); existing leases are grandfathered under the announcement. For any new EV novated lease commencing on or after 1 April 2027, flag commencement timing and verify enactment status before advising.

### T2-3 -- Car parking valuation

**Trigger:** threshold conditions met. **Issue:** lowest-fee selection, market valuation, statutory spaces vs actual usage methods. **Action:** flag exposure; escalate valuation choice.

### T2-4 -- Travelling vs living away from home

**Trigger:** extended work travel with allowances. **Issue:** outside the PCG 2021/3 safe harbour (21/90 days) the boundary needs TR 2021/4 analysis; consequences differ sharply (deductible travel allowance vs LAFHA FBT). **Action:** map the pattern of stays; flag for reviewer.

### T2-5 -- Logbook adequacy

**Trigger:** logbook older than 5 years, non-representative period, missing full-year odometer records, or business % looks aggressive vs role. **Action:** flag; default to statutory formula until resolved.

### T2-6 -- Directors' debit loans

**Trigger:** loan benefit computed for a shareholder-employee. **Issue:** Division 7A and FBT interact -- a Div 7A complying loan is generally not a fringe benefit; misclassification double-counts. **Action:** route shareholder loans through the Div 7A analysis first; flag for reviewer.

## Section 8 -- GL reading guide

1. Sweep the accounts in Section 3.1 for the FULL FBT year (1 Apr - 31 Mar) -- not the income year; a July-June income-year export misses Q1 of the FBT year (April-June 2026, the prior income year's final quarter). Export 1 April to 31 March exactly.
2. Entertainment split first: sustenance out, client share identified, per-head amounts for the minor benefit test.
3. Motor vehicles: match every vehicle carrying costs in the GL to the car register; a car with running costs but no register entry is the classic missed benefit.
4. Reimbursements and round-dollar payments to employees: expense payment benefits until shown otherwise-deductible.
5. Directors' debit loans: route via Div 7A first (T2-6).

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a GL and payroll data:

1. Run the Section 3 sweep and build a candidate benefit list by employee
2. Compute car benefits on statutory formula (no logbook assumed)
3. Apply minor benefit screens to gifts/events with per-head < $300
4. Produce a draft liability with every assumption listed
5. **Flag:** "Draft computed from ledger patterns only. Declarations, logbooks, employee contributions, lease documents and salary packaging arrangements not sighted. Reviewer must confirm before lodgment."

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Type 1 aggregate $10,000, Type 2 aggregate $5,000. -> ($10,000 x 2.0802) + ($5,000 x 1.8868) = $30,236.00; FBT = 47% x $30,236.00 = $14,210.92.

**Test 2:** Car base value $40,000, available 365 days, $1,000 contribution. -> TV $7,000 (Example 1); FBT $6,843.86.

**Test 3:** Same car, fourth anniversary of first holding fell before the start of the FBT year. -> Base value $26,666.67 (one-third reduction); TV = 20% x $26,666.67 - $1,000 = $4,333.33.
