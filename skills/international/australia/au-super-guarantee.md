# Australia Superannuation Guarantee (SG) -- Sole Trader & Employer Skill v3.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

> **Regime change at 1 July 2026 (Payday Super).** SG timing is determined by WHEN earnings are PAID, not when the work was done. Earnings paid from 1 July 2026: payday super rules (SG received by the fund within 7 business days of each payday). Earnings paid up to 30 June 2026: old quarterly rules (final quarterly deadline was 28 July 2026 for the June 2026 quarter). Both regimes appear in 2026 bank statements -- classify by payment date.

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- entity structure (sole trader / company / trust / partnership), whether client has employees, pay frequency and payday dates, qualifying earnings per payday (for employers), and voluntary contribution intent (for sole traders).

**Recommended** -- bank statements showing super fund debits, payroll register with per-payday qualifying earnings and YTD totals, TSB at 30 June prior year, taxable income for Division 293.

**Ideal** -- complete STP reporting data, super fund member statements showing receipt dates, s 290-150 notice copies, ATO online account showing contribution caps.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-AU-SG-1 -- Defined benefit funds.** *Trigger:* client has a defined benefit fund. *Message:* "Defined benefit fund calculations are actuarially determined and out of scope. Escalate."

**R-AU-SG-2 -- Constitutionally protected funds.** *Trigger:* client has a constitutionally protected state fund. *Message:* "Out of scope. Escalate."

**R-AU-SG-3 -- Family law splits.** *Trigger:* super splitting in divorce. *Message:* "Family law superannuation splits require legal advice. Out of scope."

**R-AU-SG-4 -- SGC computation.** *Trigger:* client has missed payday super deadlines and asks about the Super Guarantee Charge. *Message:* "SGC under the payday super regime is ATO-assessed per payday from STP and fund data -- it is not self-assessed and should be escalated to a qualified practitioner. Components: final SG shortfall + notional earnings (GIC rate, compounding daily) + administrative uplift + any choice loading. Note the NEW SGC (payday regime) is tax-deductible; the OLD quarterly-regime SGC remains non-deductible."

| SUPER, SUPERANNUATION | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Generic super payment |
| AUSTRALIAN SUPER, AUSTSUPER | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | AustralianSuper fund |
| REST, REST SUPER | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Retail Employees Super |
| HOSTPLUS | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Hospitality industry fund |
| CBUS, CBUS SUPER | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Construction industry fund |

| MLC SUPER, MLC | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Retail fund |
| BT SUPER | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Retail fund |
| SMSF (+ fund name) | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Self-managed super fund |

Under payday super, employer SG debits track the PAY CYCLE (weekly/fortnightly/monthly), not quarters. Frequent small super debits are the new normal, not an anomaly.

### 3.2 BPAY super payments

**BPAY super payments pattern table**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BPAY SUPER, BPAY (+ fund name) | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | BPAY is common payment method for super |
| BPAY (biller code matching known super fund) | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Check BPAY biller code |

### 3.3 Clearing house payments

**ATO SBSCH pattern table**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| (payroll software / clearing house name, e.g. BEAM, SUPERCHOICE, CLICKSUPER, WRKR) | EXCLUDE -- super contribution | Commercial clearing houses; SG for multiple employees in one debit |
| ATO SUPER, ATO CLEARING HOUSE, ATO SBSCH, SMALL BUSINESS SUPERANNUATION | EXCLUDE -- super contribution (HISTORICAL) | ATO SBSCH **closed permanently 1 July 2026** (closed to new users 1 Oct 2025). Valid only on statements dated before July 2026; payments sent on/after 1 July 2026 were returned |

**Timing trap:** a contribution is on time only when RECEIVED BY THE FUND -- receipt by a clearing house does not stop the clock. Clearing-house processing time is the employer's risk.

### 3.4 Super guarantee charge (SGC -- late/missed SG)

**SGC pattern table**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ATO SGC, SUPER GUARANTEE CHARGE | EXCLUDE -- SGC payment | ATO-assessed under payday regime; payment due on assessment day. New-regime SGC is deductible; old-regime (pre-Jul-2026 quarters) SGC is not |

### 3.5 Salary and wages (not super)

**Salary and wages pattern table**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SALARY, WAGES (outgoing) | Not super | Payroll expense -- SG is separate from wages |
| PAYROLL | Not super | Wages payment |

### 3.6 ATO tax payments (not super)

**ATO tax payments pattern table**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ATO IAS, ATO BAS | EXCLUDE -- tax | Activity statement payment (PAYG/GST) |
| ATO INCOME TAX | EXCLUDE -- tax | Not super |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six classifications for a hypothetical Australian employer with 2 employees, fortnightly payroll, during 2026-27.

### Example 1 -- Payday super contribution following a fortnightly pay run

**Input line:**
`24.07.2026 ; AUSTRALIAN SUPER ; DEBIT ; SUPER PPE 17/07 EMPLOYEE A ; -480.00 ; AUD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "AUSTRALIAN SUPER" (pattern 3.1). Payday was Friday 17 July 2026; $480.00 = $4,000 qualifying earnings x 12%. Fund receipt on 24 July is 5 business days after payday -- inside the 7-business-day window. Tax-deductible for the employer.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SG contribution for employee, on time under payday super. Tax-deductible business expense.

### Example 2 -- Personal voluntary super contribution (sole trader)

**Input line:**
`15.05.2027 ; BPAY HOSTPLUS ; DEBIT ; PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION ; -10,000.00 ; AUD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "BPAY" + "HOSTPLUS" (pattern 3.2). Sole trader making a personal super contribution. Whether this is concessional (deductible) depends on whether the s 290-150 notice is lodged and acknowledged. If notice lodged: $10,000 concessional contribution, tax-deductible, taxed at 15% in the fund, counts toward the $32,500 cap. If no notice: non-concessional, no deduction.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- personal super contribution. Deductibility depends on s 290-150 notice status. Flag: "Has the Notice of Intent to Claim a Deduction been lodged with the fund?"

### Example 3 -- Commercial clearing house payment (SBSCH is gone)

**Input line:**
`21.08.2026 ; SUPERCHOICE CLEARING ; DEBIT ; SUPER PPE 14/08 ALL EMPLOYEES ; -960.00 ; AUD`

**Reasoning:**
Commercial clearing house debit covering both employees for the 14 August payday (pattern 3.3). The ATO Small Business Super Clearing House closed permanently on 1 July 2026, so any post-June-2026 clearing house payment is a commercial provider or payroll-software-integrated service. On-time test = fund receipt within 7 business days of the 14 August payday, NOT the clearing house debit date -- flag if fund receipt confirmation is unavailable.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- SG contributions via commercial clearing house. Tax-deductible. Flag fund-receipt timing for confirmation.

### Example 4 -- Annual maximum contribution base reached

**Input line:**
(no super debit present for Employee B for the 9 April 2027 payday)

**Reasoning:**
Employee B's year-to-date qualifying earnings passed $270,830 in March 2027 (large bonus in Q3). Under the ANNUAL maximum contribution base, once YTD qualifying earnings for 2026-27 reach $270,830, no further SG is required for the rest of the financial year. Maximum SG for the year = $32,499.60. Note front-loaded income exhausts the cap early -- this replaces the old per-quarter cap logic entirely.

**Classification:** No SG expected for Employee B for remaining 2026-27 paydays. Verify YTD qualifying earnings ledger supports the cutoff.

### Example 5 -- Sole trader asking about self-SG

**Input line:**
No super fund debits found for the sole trader's own account.

**Reasoning:**
Sole traders have NO SG obligation to themselves. Drawings are not salary. If the sole trader wants super, they must make voluntary personal contributions.

**Classification:** No SG payment expected for sole trader's own account. Recommend voluntary contribution strategy.

### Example 6 -- ATO tax payment (NOT super)

**Input line:**
`28.10.2026 ; ATO ; DEBIT ; IAS SEP QTR ; -3,500.00 ; AUD`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "ATO" + "IAS" (pattern 3.6). This is an Instalment Activity Statement (PAYG/GST) payment, NOT a super contribution. (Quarterly IAS/BAS cycles continue -- only SG moved to payday timing.)

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- tax payment. NOT super.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

### Rule 1 -- SG formula (payday super)

```
remaining_base = max(0, $270,830 - YTD_qualifying_earnings_before_this_payday)
SG per payday  = 12% x min(Qualifying_earnings_paid_this_payday, remaining_base)
```

SG applies only to the first $270,830 of qualifying earnings paid in the financial year -- the payday that crosses the base attracts SG only on the portion beneath it, and later paydays attract none. Annual maximum SG per employee: exactly $32,499.60.

No $450/month threshold (removed 1 July 2022). All employees eligible.

### Rule 2 -- SG rate

2024-25: 11.5%. 2025-26 onwards: 12% (terminal rate).

### Rule 3 -- Payment deadline (earnings paid from 1 July 2026)

A contribution is on time only if it is **received by the employee's super fund**, with the information needed to allocate it to the member account, **within 7 business days after payday** (the "QE day").

- **Business day** = any day except Saturday, Sunday, or a public holiday applying to the WHOLE of any Australian state or territory. A territory-wide holiday anywhere in Australia extends the deadline for ALL employers; part-of-state holidays do not.
- **New employee (or new fund):** first contribution due within 20 business days of the relevant QE day; later paydays revert to 7. If the extended date overlaps the next payday's deadline, the later contribution inherits the extended date.
- **Out-of-cycle payments** (e.g. bonuses, per LI 2026/20): SG rides with the next regular payday's 7-business-day deadline.
- **Exceptional circumstances** (ATO class determination, e.g. natural disasters): later of 20 business days after the QE day or 20 business days after the determination.
- Funds must allocate or return contributions within 3 business days (down from 20).

**Legacy:** earnings paid up to 30 June 2026 keep the quarterly deadlines (28 Oct / 28 Jan / 28 Apr / 28 Jul); the final quarterly deadline was 28 July 2026.

### Rule 4 -- Maximum contribution base is ANNUAL from 2026-27

$270,830 of qualifying earnings for 2026-27 (formula: concessional cap x 100 / 12, rounded down to nearest $10 = $32,500 x 100 / 12). Applied on a year-to-date basis per the Rule 1 formula: SG is payable on qualifying earnings up to the base, the crossing payday is prorated, and nothing is payable on earnings beyond it. Maximum SG per employee per year: $32,499.60. (Last quarterly MCB: $62,500/quarter in 2025-26.)

### Rule 5 -- Sole traders have NO SG obligation to themselves

- **Sole trader / director SG obligation** — Drawings are not salary. Only voluntary contributions. Company directors paying themselves a salary: YES SG applies (director is employee of company).  _(Rule 4)_

### Rule 6 -- Concessional contributions cap

$32,500 (2026-27; indexed up from $30,000 on 1 July 2026). Includes employer SG + salary sacrifice + personal deductible contributions (with s 290-150 notice). Excess included in assessable income at marginal rate (with 15% offset).

### Rule 7 -- Carry-forward unused concessional cap

Up to 5 prior years' unused cap, IF TSB < $500,000 at 30 June prior year (threshold fixed in legislation, not indexed). If TSB >= $500,000: no carry-forward.

### Rule 8 -- Non-concessional cap

$130,000 (2026-27; 4 x concessional cap). Bring-forward tiers by TSB at 30 June 2026: < $1.84m -> $390,000 over 3 years; $1.84m to < $1.97m -> $260,000 over 2 years; $1.97m to < $2.1m -> $130,000 (no bring-forward); >= $2.1m -> nil.

### Rule 9 -- s 290-150 notice (personal contribution deduction)

- **s 290-150 notice requirement** — Must lodge Notice of Intent to Claim a Deduction with the super fund AND receive acknowledgement BEFORE the earlier of: lodging the tax return, or end of following financial year. If not lodged: contribution stays non-concessional, NO deduction.  _(Rule 8)_

### Rule 10 -- Division 293 (additional 15% for high earners)

- **Division 293 formula** — Div 293 income = taxable income + concessional contributions If > $250,000: Div 293 tax = 15% x lesser of (concessional contributions, excess over $250,000)  _(Rule 9)_

Threshold frozen at $250,000 (not indexed).

### Rule 11 -- Redesigned SGC (QE days from 1 July 2026)

ATO-assessed per payday (no SG statement is lodged; ATO matches STP against fund reporting). Components:

1. **Final SG shortfall** -- unpaid SG on qualifying earnings at 12%
2. **Notional earnings** -- GIC-rate interest on the shortfall, compounding daily from the day after the deadline
3. **Administrative uplift** -- starts at 60% of (shortfall + notional earnings); reduced 20 points for a clean 2-year history and up to 40 points for voluntary disclosure (0% if disclosed within 30 days with clean history)
4. **Choice loading** -- 25% of contributions where choice-of-fund rules breached, capped at $1,200 per notice period

Payment due the day the assessment is made. Unpaid 28 days after assessment -> Notice to Pay -> late payment penalty of 25% or 50% of unpaid SGC. **The new SGC is tax-deductible** (all four components); GIC on late SGC and the late payment penalty are not, and old-regime SGC (quarters before 1 July 2026) remains non-deductible. First-year approach: PCG 2026/1.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

### T2-1 -- Contractor vs employee for SG

- **T2-1** — Trigger: Client engages a contractor who may be principally for labour (SGAA s 12(3)). Issue: Multi-factor test required. SG may be triggered. Action: Flag for reviewer.  _(SGAA s 12(3))_

### T2-2 -- Multiple employers exceeding concessional cap

**Trigger:** Individual has two employers both paying SG. Combined may exceed $32,500.
**Issue:** Neither employer at fault. Individual bears excess contributions tax.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer to assess salary sacrifice adjustment.

### T2-3 -- Over-75 contributions

**Trigger:** Client aged 75+ wants to make voluntary contributions.
**Issue:** From 28 days after the end of the month the client turns 75, funds cannot accept voluntary contributions (non-concessional, salary sacrifice, or personal deductible) -- downsizer contributions are the only exception (no upper age limit). The 40-hours-in-30-days work test applies at ages 67-74 and, since 1 July 2022, only as a condition for claiming a deduction on personal contributions (ITAA97 s 290-165). Mandated employer SG has no age limit.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer.

### T2-4 -- Carry-forward with borderline TSB

- **T2-4** — Trigger: TSB close to $500,000 threshold. Issue: Carry-forward availability depends on exact TSB at 30 June. Action: Flag for reviewer to confirm TSB.

### T2-5 -- s 290-150 notice deadline approaching

**Trigger:** Client made personal contributions but has not lodged notice.
**Issue:** Missing the deadline is irreversible -- contribution stays non-concessional.
**Action:** Urgent flag. Confirm notice status before lodging return.

### T2-6 -- Straddle-period statements (2026 changeover)

**Trigger:** Bank statement spans 1 July 2026.
**Issue:** Quarterly-pattern SG debits (e.g. a 28 July 2026 payment for the June quarter) and payday-pattern debits both appear and are BOTH correct for their periods.
**Action:** Classify by the period the payment relates to; do not flag the final quarterly payment as late-pattern.

### T2-7 -- Clearing house lag near the 7-day boundary

**Trigger:** Employer pays a clearing house 4-5 business days after payday.
**Issue:** Fund receipt, not clearing house receipt, is the on-time test; processing lag can push receipt past day 7.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; recommend earlier remittance or payroll-integrated payment.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How super payments appear on Australian bank statements (2026-27)

**Direct fund payments:**
- Description: Fund name (e.g., "AUSTRALIAN SUPER", "HOSTPLUS", "REST SUPER")
- Timing: Tracks the pay cycle -- weekly/fortnightly/monthly debits within days of each payday
- Amount: 12% of that payday's qualifying earnings per employee, or personal contribution amount

**BPAY payments:**
- Description: "BPAY" + biller name or code
- Timing: Any time
- Amount: SG or personal contribution

**Clearing house payments:**
- Description: Commercial clearing house or payroll software name (SBSCH references only on pre-July-2026 statements)
- Timing: Within days of each payday
- Amount: Combined SG for all employees

**Key identification tips:**
1. Super fund names are the most reliable identifier
2. BPAY to a super fund shows biller code -- cross-reference with fund
3. Frequent small super debits aligned to paydays = payday super normal, not an anomaly
4. Quarterly-sized lumps after June 2026 (other than the final 28 July 2026 payment) = possible late-regime confusion; flag
5. Sole trader personal contributions look like any other fund payment -- context required
6. SGC payments go to ATO, not to the fund
7. "ATO SBSCH" on a statement dated after June 2026 = returned payment or misclassification; investigate

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement:

1. **Scan for super fund debits** -- match against fund names in Section 3
2. **Identify SG vs personal contributions** -- payday-aligned amounts = likely SG; ad hoc amounts = likely personal
3. **Check debit cadence against pay cycle** -- SG debits should follow every payday from July 2026
4. **Sum SG debits per employee** -- compare against expected qualifying earnings x 12% YTD to verify completeness
5. **Flag:** "Super contribution classification derived from bank statement patterns. Fund receipt dates, qualifying earnings, s 290-150 notice status, and TSB have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before tax return lodgement."

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### LISTO (Low Income Super Tax Offset)

Adjusted taxable income <= $37,000: 15% of concessional contributions, max $500 (min $10). Paid directly into super fund by ATO.

### Spouse contribution tax offset

Max $540 (18% of $3,000). Full offset if spouse income <= $37,000; nil from $40,000. Spouse must have TSB below the general transfer balance cap and not exceed their non-concessional cap.

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Employee qualifying earnings $4,000, fortnightly payday, 2026-27. -> SG = $480.00 per payday, fund receipt within 7 business days.

**Test 2:** Employee YTD qualifying earnings $268,000 before a $10,000 payday in March 2027. -> Crossing payday SG = 12% x min($10,000, $270,830 - $268,000) = 12% x $2,830 = $339.60. All later 2026-27 paydays: $0. Year SG total = exactly $32,499.60.

**Test 3:** Sole trader contributes $25,000, lodges s 290-150. TSB $200,000. -> $25,000 concessional. Deduction $25,000. Within $32,500 cap.

Taxable income $260,000, concessional $30,000. -> Div 293 income $290,000. Div 293 tax = 15% x $30,000 = $4,500.

**Test 5:** TSB $400,000. Unused cap: $5,000 (2023-24) + $10,000 (2024-25) + $15,000 (2025-26). -> Available 2026-27 cap = $32,500 + $30,000 = $62,500.

**Test 6:** Income $45,000, non-concessional contribution $1,000. -> Co-contribution = $500 (income below $49,293 lower threshold).

**Test 7:** $5,000 to spouse's fund, spouse income $36,000, spouse TSB $300,000. -> Offset = $540.

Sole trader asks about SG to self. -> $0. No obligation. Advise voluntary contributions.

**Test 9:** Payday Friday 4 Sep 2026; contribution received by fund Wednesday 16 Sep 2026 (8 business days). -> LATE. ATO-assessed SGC per Rule 11; new-regime SGC deductible.

**Test 10:** New employee starts, first payday 10 Jul 2026, no fund details yet. -> First contribution due within 20 business days of the QE day; subsequent paydays revert to 7.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER tell a sole trader they must pay SG to themselves

- NEVER reference the ATO SBSCH as an available payment channel (closed permanently 1 July 2026)
- NEVER call the new-regime SGC non-deductible (that rule died with the quarterly regime; old-regime SGC stays non-deductible)
- NEVER allow deduction claim without confirmed s 290-150 notice
- NEVER apply carry-forward if TSB >= $500,000
- NEVER present figures as definitive
- NEVER compute SGC amounts without escalating
