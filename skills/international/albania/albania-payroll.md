## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (PIT, Law 29/2023)

Albania **does** levy personal income tax on employment income. The regime was reformed by **Law No. 29/2023 "On Income Tax"**, effective from 1 January 2024 and **unchanged for tax year 2025** (PwC — Significant developments; KPMG Albania). The employer acts as withholding/payroll agent and withholds PIT monthly, with an annual reconciliation.

### 2.1 Annual rate brackets (statutory basis)

| Annual employment income (ALL) | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,040,000 | 13% | PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries; KPMG Albania |
| Over 2,040,000 | 23% on the excess above 2,040,000 | PwC; KPMG |

### 2.2 Operational monthly withholding table (PwC — the figures payroll software uses)

The annual 13%/23% structure is implemented through a banded **monthly** withholding table. Use the **PwC 2025 table** below (break-points 50,000 / 60,000 / 200,000 ALL). **Do NOT** use the table still shown on the tatime.gov.al English page — see the caveat in Section 11.

| Monthly gross salary (ALL) | Monthly PIT | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Up to 50,000 | **0%** (fully exempt) | PwC — Taxes on personal income |
| 50,001 -- 60,000 | 0% on the first 35,000; **13%** on the portion exceeding 35,000 | PwC — Taxes on personal income |
| Above 60,000 | 0% on the first 30,000; **13%** on the portion 30,001 -- 200,000; **22,100 ALL + 23%** on the portion exceeding 200,000 | PwC — Taxes on personal income |

**Arithmetic check on the 22,100 ALL constant:** in the "above 60,000" band the 13% slice runs from 30,001 to 200,000 → 13% × (200,000 − 30,000) = 13% × 170,000 = **22,100 ALL**. The constant reconciles to the cumulative tax at the 200,000 cutover. (Self-verified.)

### 2.3 Withholding method

- Cumulative monthly PAYE-style withholding by the employer, proportional to the annual 13%/23% thresholds, reconciled annually (KPMG; PwC).
- PIT and contributions are declared and paid **together** monthly via the GDT portal.
- Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents are taxed only on Albania-sourced (territorial) income (PwC).

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Whether the 11.2% employee social+health contributions are deducted from gross *before* PIT is computed. The research `conservative_defaults` instruct deducting contributions first, but the PwC monthly table is defined on **monthly gross salary**. This skill applies the PwC banded table to **gross salary** for the band determination (the literal PwC reading) in all worked examples, and flags the alternative (contributions-first) method here. The precise mechanics of the phased deductions in the 50,000–60,000 band reportedly depend on standard annual deduction tiers (600,000 / 420,000 / 360,000 ALL); a licensed Albanian accountant must confirm the exact formula against current GDT Albanian-language guidance and the payroll software.

---

## Section 3 -- Social and Health Insurance -- Employee Deductions

Employee contributions total **11.2%** of gross, split between social insurance and health insurance, withheld by the employer (PwC — Other taxes).

| Contribution | Employee rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (pension/social) | 9.5% | Monthly gross between floor 40,000 ALL and ceiling 176,416 ALL (2025) | PwC; HLB Albania |
| Health insurance | 1.7% | **Full** monthly gross — no floor, no ceiling | PwC |
| **Total employee** | **11.2%** | see component bases | PwC |

**Column check:** 9.5% + 1.7% = **11.2%** ✓ (Self-verified.)

- The 9.5% social component is **capped** at the ceiling (176,416 ALL) and **floored** at 40,000 ALL (2025).
- The 1.7% health component is assessed on **full gross** with no cap or floor.

---

## Section 4 -- Social and Health Insurance -- Employer Contributions

Employer contributions total **16.7%** of gross (PwC — Other taxes).

| Contribution | Employer rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (pension/social) | 15% | Monthly gross between floor 40,000 ALL and ceiling 176,416 ALL (2025) | PwC; HLB Albania |
| Health insurance | 1.7% | **Full** monthly gross — no floor, no ceiling | PwC |
| **Total employer** | **16.7%** | see component bases | PwC |

**Column check:** 15% + 1.7% = **16.7%** ✓ (Self-verified.)

### 4.1 Combined burden

| Party | Social | Health | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 9.5% | 1.7% | 11.2% |
| Employer | 15% | 1.7% | 16.7% |
| **Combined** | **24.5%** | **3.4%** | **27.9%** |

**Total-row check:** social column 9.5 + 15 = **24.5** ✓; health column 1.7 + 1.7 = **3.4** ✓; total column 11.2 + 16.7 = **27.9** ✓; and 24.5 + 3.4 = **27.9** ✓. (Self-verified — all three additions reconcile.)

### 4.2 Self-employed (reference only — not employer payroll)

| Contribution | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Self-employed (non-agriculture) social insurance | 23% (combined) | Not less than the minimum salary; minimum monthly base 40,000 ALL (2025) | PwC — Other taxes |
| Self-employed health insurance | 3.4% (combined) | Not less than twice the minimum salary (≈ 80,000 ALL in 2025) | PwC; HLB Albania |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The self-employed health base of "twice the minimum salary" is stated as 100,000 ALL in 2026 sources (2× the 2026 minimum of 50,000). The 2025 equivalent (2× 40,000 = 80,000 ALL) was not directly confirmed from a primary source for 2025. Self-employed payroll is out of scope for this skill — see `albania-income-tax` / `albania-self-employed` for the self-employed regime.

---

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage and Contribution Base

| Item | 2025 value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| National minimum wage | 40,000 ALL/month gross (in force since March 2023, based on 174 normal working hours/month) | HLB Albania; Karanovic & Partners |
| Social-insurance floor | 40,000 ALL/month (equal to minimum wage) | PwC; HLB Albania |
| Social-insurance ceiling | 176,416 ALL/month (indexed with the minimum wage) | HLB Albania; rate guides |
| Health-insurance base | Full gross — no floor, no ceiling | PwC |

### 5.1 2026 change (forward-looking, NOT applied to 2025 payroll)

- From **1 January 2026**, the minimum wage rises to **50,000 ALL/month** under **Council of Ministers Decision No. 776 dated 19 December 2025** (HLB Albania; Karanovic & Partners). The social-insurance floor moves to 50,000 ALL and the ceiling rises.
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Sources disagree on the post-1-Jan-2026 **maximum social-insurance base**: HLB states **186,416 ALL** (a flat +10,000 increase matching the minimum-wage rise) while Karanovic/secondary summaries state **220,520 ALL** (a +25% indexation). The 2025 figure (176,416 ALL) is consistent across sources. Confirm the 2026 ceiling from the official ISSH/GDT publication before applying to any 2026 period.

---

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag the assumption to the user:

1. **Monthly withholding table:** use the **PwC 2025 monthly table** (50,000 / 60,000 / 200,000 ALL break-points), **NOT** the outdated table on the tatime.gov.al English page (30,000 / 150,000 / 15,600 ALL), which reflects the pre-2024 Law 8438/1998 regime (PwC; caveat Section 11).
2. **Contribution base (2025):** apply social-insurance floor **40,000 ALL** and ceiling **176,416 ALL**. For periods from 1 January 2026, the floor becomes 50,000 ALL and the ceiling rises (exact 2026 ceiling unresolved — see Section 5.1).
3. **Health insurance:** the 1.7% employer + 1.7% employee health components are computed on **full gross with no cap or floor**; apply the cap/floor **only** to the 15%/9.5% social-insurance components.
4. **PIT band determination:** determine the PIT band from **monthly gross salary** per the PwC table. (The alternative — deducting 11.2% contributions before PIT — is flagged as a research gap in Section 2.3; do not silently switch methods.)
5. **Currency:** all amounts in **ALL**. Never assume EUR.
6. **Residence:** assume the employee is an Albanian tax resident unless told otherwise (worldwide-income basis). For non-residents, only Albania-sourced employment income is taxed (PwC).

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 7.1 Required inputs (must have before computing)

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Monthly **gross** salary in ALL | Drives PIT band, social base (subject to floor/ceiling), and health base |
| Pay period (month/year) | Determines which floor/ceiling and minimum wage apply (2025 vs 2026 differ) |
| Employee tax residence (resident / non-resident) | Resident = worldwide; non-resident = Albania-source only |
| Whether the employee has more than one employer | Triggers mandatory DIVA annual filing (Section 9) |
| Full-time / part-time and hours | Affects whether the 40,000 ALL social floor binds (part-time / partial month) |
| Employer registration status with GDT | Must be registered before running payroll; foreign employers too |

### 7.2 Refusal catalogue — STOP and ask rather than guess

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| Salary stated in EUR or another currency | **Refuse to compute.** Ask for the ALL gross amount (or the FX basis the employer uses). |
| Pay period in 2026 or later | Compute using 2025 figures **only if** the user confirms; otherwise flag that the floor (50,000 ALL) and ceiling changed and the 2026 ceiling is unresolved (Section 5.1). |
| Employee may be a non-resident | Confirm residence; do not apply worldwide basis to a non-resident. |
| User asks for the "official" monthly table and quotes the tatime.gov.al 30,000/150,000 figures | Do not use them — explain they are the pre-2024 regime; use the PwC 2025 table (Section 11). |
| Self-employed / sole trader, not an employee | Out of scope — direct to the self-employed/income-tax skill (Section 4.2). |
| Request to compute exact penalty amounts for late filing / unregistered workers | State the 10% late-payment penalty + interest (sourced) and flag that exact administrative-fine figures are unconfirmed (Section 10). |
| Net-to-gross "gross-up" with a target net | Possible but iterative; state that the result is an estimate and that the contributions-vs-PIT ordering gap (Section 2.3) affects the answer. |

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All figures in ALL, tax year 2025. Social base = gross clamped to [40,000 ; 176,416]; health base = full gross; PIT per the PwC monthly table (Section 2.2). Each line is recomputed end-to-end below.

### Example A — Gross 45,000 ALL/month (within social band, below PIT threshold)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 45,000.00 |
| Social base | 45,000 within [40,000;176,416] | 45,000.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 45,000 | 4,275.00 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 45,000 | 765.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 4,275 + 765 | **5,040.00** |
| PIT | gross ≤ 50,000 → 0% | 0.00 |
| **Net pay** | 45,000 − 5,040 − 0 | **39,960.00** |
| Employer social | 15% × 45,000 | 6,750.00 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 45,000 | 765.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 6,750 + 765 | **7,515.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 45,000 + 7,515 | **52,515.00** |

### Example B — Gross 55,000 ALL/month (50,001–60,000 PIT band)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 55,000.00 |
| Social base | 55,000 within band | 55,000.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 55,000 | 5,225.00 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 55,000 | 935.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 5,225 + 935 | **6,160.00** |
| PIT | 0% on first 35,000; 13% × (55,000 − 35,000) = 13% × 20,000 | 2,600.00 |
| **Net pay** | 55,000 − 6,160 − 2,600 | **46,240.00** |
| Employer social | 15% × 55,000 | 8,250.00 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 55,000 | 935.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 8,250 + 935 | **9,185.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 55,000 + 9,185 | **64,185.00** |

### Example C — Gross 120,000 ALL/month (above 60,000 band, below ceiling and below 200,000)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 120,000.00 |
| Social base | 120,000 < 176,416 | 120,000.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 120,000 | 11,400.00 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 120,000 | 2,040.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 11,400 + 2,040 | **13,440.00** |
| PIT | 0% on first 30,000; 13% × (120,000 − 30,000) = 13% × 90,000 | 11,700.00 |
| **Net pay** | 120,000 − 13,440 − 11,700 | **94,860.00** |
| Employer social | 15% × 120,000 | 18,000.00 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 120,000 | 2,040.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 18,000 + 2,040 | **20,040.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 120,000 + 20,040 | **140,040.00** |

### Example D — Gross 250,000 ALL/month (above social ceiling AND above 200,000 PIT cutover)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 250,000.00 |
| Social base | capped at ceiling | 176,416.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 176,416 | 16,759.52 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 250,000 (uncapped) | 4,250.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 16,759.52 + 4,250 | **21,009.52** |
| PIT | 22,100 + 23% × (250,000 − 200,000) = 22,100 + 23% × 50,000 = 22,100 + 11,500 | 33,600.00 |
| **Net pay** | 250,000 − 21,009.52 − 33,600 | **195,390.48** |
| Employer social | 15% × 176,416 | 26,462.40 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 250,000 | 4,250.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 26,462.40 + 4,250 | **30,712.40** |
| **Total employer cost** | 250,000 + 30,712.40 | **280,712.40** |

### Example E — Minimum wage, gross 40,000 ALL/month (floor edge)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 40,000.00 |
| Social base | = floor 40,000 | 40,000.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 40,000 | 3,800.00 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 40,000 | 680.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 3,800 + 680 | **4,480.00** |
| PIT | gross ≤ 50,000 → 0% | 0.00 |
| **Net pay** | 40,000 − 4,480 − 0 | **35,520.00** |
| Employer social | 15% × 40,000 | 6,000.00 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 40,000 | 680.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 6,000 + 680 | **6,680.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 40,000 + 6,680 | **46,680.00** |

### Example F — Part-time, gross 30,000 ALL/month (below social floor)

A part-time / partial-month wage can be below the 40,000 ALL social floor. The **social** components are computed on the **40,000 floor**, while the **health** components use the **actual gross** (no floor).

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Gross | — | 30,000.00 |
| Social base | floored at 40,000 | 40,000.00 |
| Employee social | 9.5% × 40,000 | 3,800.00 |
| Employee health | 1.7% × 30,000 (no floor) | 510.00 |
| **Employee contributions** | 3,800 + 510 | **4,310.00** |
| PIT | gross ≤ 50,000 → 0% | 0.00 |
| **Net pay** | 30,000 − 4,310 − 0 | **25,690.00** |
| Employer social | 15% × 40,000 | 6,000.00 |
| Employer health | 1.7% × 30,000 | 510.00 |
| **Employer contributions** | 6,000 + 510 | **6,510.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 30,000 + 6,510 | **36,510.00** |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The exact treatment of a sub-floor part-time / partial-month wage (whether the 40,000 ALL floor is pro-rated for part-time, or applied in full) was not confirmed from a primary source. Example F applies the full floor conservatively; a licensed Albanian accountant should confirm the pro-ration rule.

---

## Section 10 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply mechanically)

1. PIT exists on employment income; 13% up to 2,040,000 ALL/year, 23% above (PwC; KPMG).
2. Use the PwC 2025 **monthly** withholding table (break-points 50,000 / 60,000 / 200,000 ALL), not the pre-2024 tatime.gov.al English table (Section 11).
3. Salary ≤ 50,000 ALL/month → 0% PIT (PwC).
4. Salary 50,001–60,000 ALL/month → 0% on first 35,000, 13% on the excess (PwC).
5. Salary > 60,000 ALL/month → 0% on first 30,000, 13% on 30,001–200,000, then 22,100 ALL + 23% on the excess over 200,000 (PwC).
6. Employer contributions = 16.7% (15% social + 1.7% health) (PwC).
7. Employee contributions = 11.2% (9.5% social + 1.7% health) (PwC).
8. Combined employer + employee burden = 27.9% (PwC; arithmetic verified Section 4.1).
9. 2025 social base: floor 40,000 ALL, ceiling 176,416 ALL; cap/floor apply ONLY to the 15%/9.5% social components (HLB Albania; rate guides).
10. Health components (1.7% each) are on full gross — no floor, no ceiling (PwC).
11. 2025 minimum wage = 40,000 ALL/month (HLB Albania; Karanovic & Partners).
12. Monthly payroll list (PIT + social + health) declared and paid electronically by the **20th** of the following month (PwC; tatime.gov.al).
13. DIVA annual return due **31 March** of the following year; balance of tax also due 31 March (PwC).
14. Employers (including foreign companies without a local entity) must register with the GDT and register each employee at least one day before work starts (Rivermate; tatime.gov.al).
15. Late payment of tax/contributions → 10% penalty + default interest under the Law on Tax Procedures (No. 9920/2008) (Playroll; statute).

## Section 11 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items require a licensed Albanian accountant's judgement and/or confirmation against primary sources before reliance.

1. **Monthly bracket discrepancy.** The tatime.gov.al English page still displays an **outdated** monthly table (0% to 30,000; 13% on 30,001–150,000; 15,600 ALL + 23% over 150,000) reflecting the pre-2024 **Law 8438/1998** regime. The current 2025 structure (Law 29/2023) is the **PwC** table used in this skill (50,000 / 60,000 / 200,000 break-points). A reviewer should confirm the exact monthly withholding formula against current GDT Albanian-language guidance and the payroll software, including the phased-deduction mechanics of the 50,000–60,000 band (reportedly linked to standard annual deduction tiers of 600,000 / 420,000 / 360,000 ALL).
2. **Contributions-vs-PIT ordering** (Section 2.3) — confirm whether the 11.2% employee contributions are deducted before PIT.
3. **2026 social ceiling** (Section 5.1) — HLB (186,416 ALL) vs Karanovic/secondary (220,520 ALL); confirm from ISSH/GDT before applying any 2026 period.
4. **Penalty amounts** (Section 10, rule 15 and below) — the 10% late-payment penalty + interest is from secondary summaries; exact administrative fines for late payroll declaration and for unregistered workers must be confirmed against the primary text of Law No. 9920/2008.
5. **Part-time social floor** pro-ration (Section 9, Example F).
6. **DIVA scope** for a given employee (single vs multiple employers, other non-final-withholding income) — confirm filing obligation (Section 12.2).

3. Tax residence (resident / non-resident).
4. Whether the employee has more than one employer (DIVA trigger).
5. Full-time / part-time and contracted hours (floor edge — Section 9 Example F).
6. Confirm the employer is registered with the GDT and the employee was registered ≥ 1 day before starting (Section 10, rule 14).

If any required input is missing, state what is missing and **do not** fabricate a figure.

## Section 18 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (PIT + social + health) | **This skill (albania-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed / sole-trader income & contributions | albania-income-tax.md / albania-self-employed.md |
| Albania VAT (TVSH) returns | albania-vat-return.md |
| Albania corporate income tax | albania-corporate-tax.md |
| Albania bookkeeping | albania-bookkeeping.md |

### Key handoff points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** gross wages and the 16.7% employer contributions are expenses; PIT withheld and the 11.2% employee contributions are liabilities until remitted on the 20th.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** the year's withholding feeds the employee's DIVA reconciliation where a DIVA filing is required (Section 12.2).

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute Albanian payroll in EUR or any non-ALL currency — refuse and ask for the ALL gross.
- NEVER use the outdated tatime.gov.al English monthly table (30,000 / 150,000 / 15,600) — it reflects the pre-2024 Law 8438/1998 regime; use the PwC 2025 table.
- NEVER apply the social-insurance floor/ceiling to the health-insurance components — health (1.7% each) is on full gross with no cap or floor.
- NEVER apply the 1.7% health cap — there is none.
- NEVER apply 2025 figures (floor 40,000 / ceiling 176,416 / min wage 40,000) to a 2026 or later period without flagging the 1 Jan 2026 changes and the unresolved 2026 ceiling.
- NEVER omit the employer 16.7% on-cost when quoting total employment cost.
- NEVER state exact penalty/fine amounts for late declaration or unregistered workers as confirmed — they are research gaps pending primary-source confirmation.
- NEVER miss the monthly payroll-list deadline (20th of the following month) — 10% penalty + interest applies.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — label them estimated and direct the user to a licensed Albanian accountant.
- NEVER silently switch between the gross-basis PIT table and the contributions-first method (Section 2.3) — disclose the assumption.
