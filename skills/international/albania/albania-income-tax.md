### Tax Rate Brackets (2025)

**Employment income — ANNUAL (year-end reconciliation)** [Law 29/2023; PwC: Taxes on personal income]

| Annual Taxable Income (ALL) | Rate | Cumulative Tax at Top |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,040,000 | 13% | ALL 265,200 |
| 2,040,001+ | 23% | -- |

*Cumulative check: 2,040,000 × 13% = ALL 265,200. Above the breakpoint, tax = 265,200 + 23% × (income − 2,040,000). A personal allowance reduces the taxable base at lower incomes — see the monthly schedule below.*

**Employment income — MONTHLY withholding (PAYE) schedule (official tatime.gov.al table)** [tatime.gov.al: Tax on personal income; PwC]

| Monthly Gross (ALL) | Tax |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 50,000 | 0% (fully exempt) |
| 50,001 -- 60,000 | 13% on the amount exceeding ALL 35,000 (transitional band — allowance partially phases out) |
| 60,001 -- 200,000 | 13% on the amount exceeding ALL 30,000 |
| 200,001+ | ALL 22,100 + 23% on the amount exceeding ALL 200,000 |

*Arithmetic check on the ALL 22,100 base: at monthly gross ALL 200,000 the prior-band tax = 13% × (200,000 − 30,000) = 13% × 170,000 = ALL 22,100. Consistent.*

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The monthly 23% breakpoint (ALL 200,000/month = ALL 2,400,000/year) does NOT line up with the annual 23% breakpoint (ALL 2,040,000/year = ALL 170,000/month). The research notes two different official presentations of the monthly table (a simplified 0/13/23 version on tatime.gov.al vs. the allowance-phase-out version above from PwC). Reconcile both against General Instruction No. 26/2023 for the authoritative monthly algorithm before relying on month-by-month figures; the year-end reconciliation uses the annual 13%/23% brackets.

**Self-employed / business / trader income — ANNUAL taxable profit** [HLB Albania; PwC]

| Annual Taxable Profit (ALL) | Statutory Rate | Effective Rate 2025 |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 14,000,000 | 15% | **0% until 31 Dec 2029** |
| 14,000,001+ | 23% | 23% |

*Self-employed and registered entrepreneurs with annual turnover up to ALL 14,000,000 enjoy a 0% rate until 31 December 2029 (statutory rate 15%); profit above ALL 14,000,000 is taxed at 23%. Subject to profession-based exclusions (CoM Decision No. 753) and the anti-disguised-employment rule below.*

**Investment income** [PwC; HLB Albania]

| Type | Rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends | 8% |
| Interest, royalties, rental income, capital gains (incl. real estate & securities), crypto, other investment income | 15% |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency | Treat as Albanian tax resident (worldwide income); non-residents taxed on Albania-source income only [PwC] |
| Unknown self-employed eligibility for 0% band | Do NOT assume 0% — confirm turnover ≤ ALL 14m AND activity not on CoM Decision 753 excluded list AND no disguised-employment reclassification [PwC] |
| Single-client / few-client self-employment | Apply disguised-employment reclassification (employment rates 13%/23%) unless proven otherwise [HLB Albania] |
| Unknown contribution base ceiling | Use the year's official CoM-decision floor/ceiling; verify before computing; health insurance has NO ceiling [Eurofast Payroll Guide 2025] |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume not registered unless turnover > ALL 10,000,000 evidenced [tatime.gov.al] |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) tax residency (resident/non-resident), (b) income type(s) (employment, self-employed/business, investment), and (c) for self-employed: annual turnover and whether the activity is eligible for the 0% small-business band.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, monthly payroll/withholding declarations, social/health contribution payment records, prior-year annual return (D1/DIVA), VAT registration status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, list of clients with revenue share (to test the disguised-employment rule), dependent-children details (per-child deduction), education-expense receipts, prior-year tax assessment.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that income classification (employment vs self-employed vs investment) is correct."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-AL-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether the client is taxed on worldwide income (resident) or Albania-source income only (non-resident). This skill defaults to resident treatment but cannot finalise without confirmation. Please confirm before filing."

**R-AL-2 -- Self-employed eligibility for the 0% band unconfirmed.** "The 0%-until-2029 rate applies only if turnover ≤ ALL 14,000,000, the activity is not on the CoM Decision No. 753 excluded-profession list, and the income is not reclassified as disguised employment. This skill cannot confirm eligibility without the client's activity code and client-concentration data. Escalate to an Albanian tax advisor."

**R-AL-3 -- Companies and partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and sole self-employed persons only. Corporate income tax (tatimi mbi fitimin) and partnership returns are out of scope. Escalate to an Albanian tax advisor."

**R-AL-4 -- Real-estate or securities capital gains.** "Capital gains on real estate and securities are taxed at 15% but require specialised computation of acquisition cost and holding. Escalate to an Albanian tax advisor for material disposals."

**R-AL-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to DPT enforcement. Late-payment penalty is 10% plus 0.06%/day interest (capped at 365 days). Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-AL-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Albanian VAT (TVSH), use the albania-vat skill. Standard VAT rate is 20%; registration is mandatory above ALL 10,000,000 turnover."

**R-AL-7 -- 2026 figures requested.** "From 1 January 2026 the minimum wage rises to ALL 50,000/month (CoM Decision 776/2025) and Law No. 79/2025 amends tax procedures (automated VAT, e-communication, lower cash limits). This skill is built for the 2025 tax year — confirm the year-correct figures before applying to 2026."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Albanian statements mix Albanian and English; common Albanian terms are listed. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All examples are for the 2025 tax year and use the figures cited in Sections 1 and 5. Tax figures are estimates and must be reviewer-confirmed.

### Example 1 -- Employee, mid-range salary (monthly PAYE)

**Input line:**
`31/03/2025 ; BKT TRANSFERTE ; EMPLOYER ALPHA SHPK ; RROGA MARS 2025 ; +90,000.00 ; ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly employment income ALL 90,000 (gross). This falls in the 60,001–200,000 band: PAYE = 13% on the amount exceeding ALL 30,000.
- Taxable above allowance = 90,000 − 30,000 = ALL 60,000
- PIT withheld = 13% × 60,000 = ALL 7,800
- Employee social + health = 11.2% × 90,000 = ALL 10,080 (90,000 is within the 2025 floor ALL 40,000 / ceiling ~ALL 176,416 [RESEARCH GAP — confirm ceiling])
- Net pay = 90,000 − 7,800 − 10,080 = **ALL 72,120**

**Classification:** Employment income; PIT withheld ALL 7,800; employee contributions ALL 10,080; net ALL 72,120.

### Example 2 -- High earner, monthly PAYE in the 23% band

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; Raiffeisen ; EMPLOYER BETA SHA ; RROGA PRILL ; +250,000.00 ; ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly gross ALL 250,000 → top band (200,001+): PIT = ALL 22,100 + 23% on the amount exceeding ALL 200,000.
- Excess = 250,000 − 200,000 = ALL 50,000
- PIT = 22,100 + (23% × 50,000) = 22,100 + 11,500 = **ALL 33,600**
- Employee contributions: social 9.5% capped at the ceiling; health 1.7% uncapped. Using the reported ceiling ~ALL 176,416 [RESEARCH GAP — confirm]: social = 9.5% × 176,416 = ALL 16,759.52; health = 1.7% × 250,000 = ALL 4,250 → contributions = ALL 21,009.52

**Classification:** Employment income; PIT withheld ALL 33,600; contributions ALL 21,009.52 (ceiling-dependent — reviewer to confirm ceiling figure).

### Example 3 -- Self-employed, within the 0% small-business band

**Input lines (full year, summarised):**
`Total business income (credits): +9,500,000.00 ALL`
`Total allowable expenses (debits): -3,200,000.00 ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Annual turnover ALL 9,500,000 ≤ ALL 14,000,000, activity confirmed eligible (not on CoM Decision 753 list) and no disguised-employment reclassification.
- Taxable profit = 9,500,000 − 3,200,000 = ALL 6,300,000
- PIT rate = **0% until 31 Dec 2029** → income tax = **ALL 0**
- Note: self-employed social insurance 23% and health 3.4% still apply on their statutory bases (Section 5). On a monthly base of ALL 50,000: social = 23% × 50,000 = ALL 11,500/month; health = 3.4% × 100,000 = ALL 3,400/month [PwC: other taxes].

**Classification:** Self-employed business profit ALL 6,300,000; income tax ALL 0 (0% band); contributions due separately.

### Example 4 -- Self-employed, profit above ALL 14,000,000

**Input lines (full year, summarised):**
`Total business income: +20,000,000.00 ALL`
`Total allowable expenses: -3,000,000.00 ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Taxable profit = 20,000,000 − 3,000,000 = ALL 17,000,000.
- Band 0 – 14,000,000: 0% (until 2029) → ALL 0
- Band above 14,000,000: 23% × (17,000,000 − 14,000,000) = 23% × 3,000,000 = **ALL 690,000**
- Total income tax = 0 + 690,000 = **ALL 690,000**

**Classification:** Self-employed business profit ALL 17,000,000; income tax ALL 690,000.

### Example 5 -- Dividend received (8%)

**Input line:**
`15/06/2025 ; Credins ; SHPK GAMMA ; DIVIDENT 2024 ; +500,000.00 ; ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Dividend income taxed at 8% (typically withheld at source).
- Tax = 8% × 500,000 = **ALL 40,000**
- Net = 500,000 − 40,000 = ALL 460,000

**Classification:** Investment income (dividend); tax ALL 40,000.

### Example 6 -- Rental income (15%)

**Input line:**
`05/07/2025 ; Intesa ; TENANT D. HOXHA ; QIRA KORRIK ; +60,000.00 ; ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Rental income is investment income taxed at 15%.
- Tax = 15% × 60,000 = **ALL 9,000**
- Net = 60,000 − 9,000 = ALL 51,000

**Classification:** Investment income (rental); tax ALL 9,000. (Where allowable expenses against rent apply, reviewer to confirm method per Law 29/2023.)

### Example 7 -- Disguised employment reclassification

**Input lines (full year, summarised):**
`Self-employed income from ONE client: +4,000,000.00 ALL (100% from a single client)`

**Reasoning:**
Because ≥80% of the self-employed income is from a single client, the anti-disguised-employment rule reclassifies the income as employment income, taxed at 13%/23% (NOT 0%). [HLB Albania]
- Annual taxable income ALL 4,000,000 → first 2,040,000 at 13% = ALL 265,200; excess 1,960,000 at 23% = ALL 450,800
- Income tax = 265,200 + 450,800 = **ALL 716,000**

**Classification:** Reclassified to employment income; income tax ALL 716,000 (the 0% band does NOT apply). Flag for reviewer.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Tax Year and Residency

**Legislation:** Law No. 29/2023, "On Income Tax"

The tax year is the calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec). Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Albania-source income only. [PwC: Taxes on personal income]

### 5.2 Employment Income — Progressive Rates

**Legislation:** Law 29/2023 (effective 1 Jan 2024, continuing 2025)

Annual taxable employment income: 13% up to ALL 2,040,000; 23% on the excess (cumulative tax at the breakpoint = ALL 265,200). In-year withholding uses the monthly PAYE schedule (Section 1); year-end reconciliation applies the annual brackets. [Law 29/2023; PwC; tatime.gov.al]

### 5.3 Self-Employed / Business Income

**Legislation:** Law 29/2023; HLB Albania commentary

Statutory rate 15% on profit up to ALL 14,000,000 and 23% above — BUT a **0% rate applies to the up-to-ALL-14m band until 31 December 2029**. Profit above ALL 14,000,000 is taxed at 23%. [HLB Albania; PwC]

### 5.4 Anti-Disguised-Employment Rule

**Legislation:** Law 29/2023 / implementing rules

If ≥80% of self-employed income is from a single client, OR ≥90% from fewer than three clients, the income is reclassified as employment income and taxed at 13%/23% (the 0% band does not apply). [HLB Albania]

### 5.5 Investment Income

| Type | Rate |
|---|---|
| Dividends | 8% [PwC; HLB] |
| Interest, royalties, rental income, capital gains (real estate & securities), crypto, other | 15% [PwC: income determination; HLB] |

### 5.6 Social and Health Contributions — Employees

**Legislation:** Law No. 7703/1993 (social insurance); Law No. 10383/2011 (health)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (pension/disability/maternity) | 9.5% | 15.0% |
| Health insurance | 1.7% | 1.7% |
| **TOTAL** | **11.2%** | **16.7%** |

*Column checks: employee 9.5 + 1.7 = 11.2%; employer 15.0 + 1.7 = 16.7%; combined employer + employee = 11.2 + 16.7 = 27.9%.* [PwC: other taxes]

Social insurance is computed on a gross monthly base between an annual floor and ceiling set by Council of Ministers decision (2025 floor aligned with the minimum wage ALL 40,000; ceiling reported ~ALL 176,416 in payroll guides **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact 2025 ceiling against the current CoM decision]**). Health insurance (1.7% each side) has **no ceiling** — it applies to full gross. [PwC; Eurofast Payroll Guide 2025]

### 5.7 Social and Health Contributions — Self-Employed (non-agricultural)

| Contribution | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Social insurance | 23% | on a monthly base of at least ALL 50,000 (≈ ALL 11,500/month minimum) |
| Health insurance | 3.4% | on at least ALL 100,000 (double the minimum salary base) |

[PwC: other taxes]

### 5.8 Per-Child and Education Deductions (from 2025)

**Legislation:** Law 29/2023 (2025 changes); HLB Albania

- ALL 48,000 per year per dependent child under 18
- Plus up to ALL 100,000/year for children's education
- Both available only to taxpayers with annual income below ALL 1,200,000 [HLB Albania]

### 5.9 Filing Thresholds

The annual individual return is mandatory if ANY of:
- Annual income > ALL 1,200,000 from all sources; OR
- The taxpayer had multiple employers (any income level); OR
- More than ALL 50,000 of income not subject to final withholding.

Self-employed persons must always file. [PwC: tax administration; tatime.gov.al; HLB]

### 5.10 Deadlines and Penalties

**Legislation:** Law No. 9920/2008 "On Tax Procedures"

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Annual return (D1 / DIVA) | 31 March of the following year; final tax due same date [PwC; tatime.gov.al] |
| Monthly payroll & withholding declaration | E-filed by the 20th of the following month [PwC] |
| Late filing — individual taxpayer | ALL 3,000 (plus interest) [HLB; tatime.gov.al] |
| Late filing — income-tax-registered taxpayer | ALL 10,000 [tatime.gov.al] |
| Late filing — other taxpayers (non-individual) | ALL 5,000 [tatime.gov.al] |
| Late payment penalty | 10% of the unpaid liability [tatime.gov.al] |
| Late payment interest | 0.06% per day, capped at 365 days (max 21.9%) [tatime.gov.al] |

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Penalty figures cited are pre-amendment. Law No. 79/2025 amended tax procedures effective Jan 2026; re-check before applying to 2026 periods.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Self-Employed 0% Band Eligibility

- Confirm turnover ≤ ALL 14,000,000 for the year.
- Confirm the activity is NOT on the CoM Decision No. 753 excluded-profession list. **[RESEARCH GAP — the excluded list is not enumerated here; reviewer must check Decision 753.]**

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employee, monthly PAYE in the 13% band.**
Input: monthly gross ALL 90,000.
Expected: PIT = 13% × (90,000 − 30,000) = ALL 7,800. Employee contributions 11.2% × 90,000 = ALL 10,080. Net = ALL 72,120.

**Test 2 -- Employee, monthly PAYE in the 23% band.**
Input: monthly gross ALL 250,000.
Expected: PIT = 22,100 + 23% × (250,000 − 200,000) = 22,100 + 11,500 = ALL 33,600.

**Test 3 -- Self-employed within the 0% band.**
Input: turnover ALL 9,500,000, expenses ALL 3,200,000, eligible activity, no disguised employment.
Expected: taxable profit ALL 6,300,000; income tax = ALL 0 (0% until 2029). Contributions due separately.

**Test 4 -- Self-employed above ALL 14m.**
Input: profit ALL 17,000,000.
Expected: income tax = 23% × (17,000,000 − 14,000,000) = ALL 690,000.

**Test 5 -- Dividend.**
Input: dividend ALL 500,000.
Expected: tax = 8% × 500,000 = ALL 40,000; net ALL 460,000.

**Test 6 -- Rental income.**
Input: monthly rent received ALL 60,000.
Expected: tax = 15% × 60,000 = ALL 9,000; net ALL 51,000.

**Test 7 -- Disguised employment.**
Input: ALL 4,000,000 self-employed income, 100% from one client.
Expected: reclassified to employment; tax = 265,200 + 23% × (4,000,000 − 2,040,000) = 265,200 + 450,800 = ALL 716,000. The 0% band does NOT apply.

**Test 8 -- Annual employment reconciliation, top band.**
Input: annual employment income ALL 3,000,000.
Expected: tax = 265,200 + 23% × (3,000,000 − 2,040,000) = 265,200 + 220,800 = ALL 486,000.
