  Use this skill whenever asked about Albania social security and health insurance contributions for employees, employers, or the self-employed. Trigger on phrases like "how much social insurance do I pay in Albania", "Albanian payroll contributions", "sigurime shoqerore", "sigurime shendetesore", "social insurance rate Albania", "health insurance contribution Albania", "employer contribution Albania", "self-employed social insurance Albania", "Listepagesa", "E-SIG payroll declaration", "minimum contribution base", "maximum contribution base", "ALL 40,000 minimum wage", "ALL 50,000 minimum wage 2026", or any question about Albanian social/health contribution obligations for a client. Also trigger when classifying Albanian bank-statement lines that relate to DPT (tatime) payroll-tax debits, social/health insurance remittances, or government contribution payments from BKT, Raiffeisen Bank Albania, Credins, Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania, or other Albanian banks. This skill covers employee/employer social (9.5%/15%) and health (1.7%/1.7%) rates, the min/max contribution base, self-employed rates (23% social / 3.4% health), the 2026 base changes, the 20th-of-month declaration deadline, bank-statement classification patterns, and edge cases. This skill is scoped to social-security and health contributions; personal income tax (PIT) is covered only as context. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Albanian contribution work.

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- employment status (employee vs self-employed) and gross monthly salary (or self-employed base reference). Without employment status, STOP.

**Recommended** -- the period/month being computed (to select 2025 vs 2026 bases), and whether the salary is below the minimum base or above the social ceiling.

**Ideal** -- the monthly payroll declaration (Listepagesa / E-SIG 025), bank statements showing DPT contribution remittances, and the DPT/e-Albania account confirming the applicable contribution bases.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-AL-SSC-1 -- Employment status unknown.** *Trigger:* not stated whether the person is an employee or self-employed. *Message:* "Employment status is mandatory. Employees pay 11.2% (employee) with the employer paying 16.7%; the self-employed pay 23% social on the minimum base plus 3.4% health on double the minimum base. Cannot proceed without this."

**R-AL-SSC-2 -- 2026 maximum base relied upon for a high earner.** *Trigger:* salary above ALL 186,416/month in a 2026 period AND the result is being relied upon for filing. *Message:* "The 2026 maximum social-insurance base is DISPUTED across sources (PwC/HLB say ALL 186,416; one firm summary of DCM No. 776 says ALL 220,520). Do not file a high-earner 2026 computation without confirming the ceiling against the published DCM No. 776 / Official Gazette. Escalate to an Albanian licensed accountant."

**R-AL-SSC-3 -- Penalty / late-payment quantification.** *Trigger:* client asks for the exact late-filing or late-payment penalty. *Message:* "Exact penalty amounts and interest rates under Law No. 9920/2008 (Tax Procedures) were not confirmed from an authoritative primary source in this skill [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Do not quantify penalties. Escalate to an Albanian licensed accountant."

**R-AL-SSC-4 -- Personal income tax (PIT) computation.** *Trigger:* client asks for the PIT (income tax) due, not contributions. *Message:* "This skill covers social-security and health contributions only. Albanian PIT monthly bands conflict across sources (tax-free portion variously reported as ALL 30,000-50,000) [RESEARCH GAP]. Verify monthly PIT bands with the DPT before computing PIT; use a dedicated PIT skill."

**R-AL-SSC-5 -- Expat / posted-worker / A1-equivalent coverage.** *Trigger:* cross-border posting, totalization, or treaty coverage question. *Message:* "Cross-border social-security coordination (posted workers, totalization agreements) is outside the scope of this skill. Escalate to an Albanian licensed accountant."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for Albanian bank-statement transactions related to contributions. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Contribution remittances EXCLUDE from any VAT return or revenue classification -- they are statutory payroll/personal obligations, not business supplies. Employer contributions are a payroll cost; employee contributions and PIT are withheld from gross pay.

### 3.1 DPT / tax-authority contribution remittances

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DPT, TATIME, DREJTORIA E PERGJITHSHME E TATIMEVE | EXCLUDE -- contribution/PIT remittance | Monthly payroll remittance to the tax authority |
| SIGURIME SHOQERORE | EXCLUDE -- social insurance contribution | "Social insurance" in Albanian |
| SIGURIME SHENDETESORE | EXCLUDE -- health insurance contribution | "Health insurance" in Albanian |
| KONTRIBUTE, KONTRIBUTI | EXCLUDE -- contributions | Generic "contributions" reference |
| LISTEPAGESA, E-SIG, E-SIG 025 | EXCLUDE -- payroll declaration payment | Payment tied to the monthly payroll list |
| ISSH, SIGURIMET SHOQERORE | EXCLUDE -- social insurance | ISSH = benefits administrator reference |

### 3.2 Contribution debits appearing on specific Albanian banks

| Bank | Typical debit description | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| BKT (Banka Kombetare Tregtare) | "DPT" / "TATIME" / "SIGURIME SHOQERORE" | EXCLUDE -- contribution remittance |
| Raiffeisen Bank Albania | "DREJTORIA E TATIMEVE" / "KONTRIBUTE" | EXCLUDE -- contribution remittance |
| Credins Bank | "TATIME" / "SIGURIME" | EXCLUDE -- contribution remittance |
| Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania | "DPT KONTRIBUTE" / "SIGURIME SHENDETESORE" | EXCLUDE -- contribution remittance |
| Banka e Tiranes / Tirana Bank | "TATIME / SIGURIME" | EXCLUDE -- contribution remittance |

### 3.3 PIT (income tax) remittances -- exclude, but NOT a contribution

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TATIMI MBI TE ARDHURAT, TAP | EXCLUDE -- personal income tax | PIT withheld from salary, not a social contribution |
| DIVA | EXCLUDE -- annual income declaration payment | Annual PIT reconciliation, not a contribution |

### 3.4 Salary / payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PAGA, PAGAT, RROGA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net salary paid to employee, not a contribution |
| PAGA (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not a contribution payment |

### 3.5 Benefits received (not contributions)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION, PENSIONI (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- pension income received | ISSH benefit, not a contribution paid |
| RAPORT MJEKESOR, BARRELINDJE (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- sickness/maternity benefit received | Not a contribution paid |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank-statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Albanian small business and its staff. All figures in ALL. Rates: 2025 unless stated.

### Example 1 -- Standard salary within bounds (2025)

**Scenario:** Employee on gross ALL 100,000/month (between the ALL 40,000 floor and ALL 176,416 ceiling).

**Reasoning:**
- Social base = 100,000 (within bounds). Employee social 9.5% = 9,500; employer social 15% = 15,000.
- Health base = 100,000 (no ceiling). Employee health 1.7% = 1,700; employer health 1.7% = 1,700.
- Employee total = 9,500 + 1,700 = **11,200** (= 11.2% of 100,000 ✓).
- Employer total = 15,000 + 1,700 = **16,700** (= 16.7% of 100,000 ✓).
- Combined = 11,200 + 16,700 = 27,900 (= 27.9% ✓).

**Bank line:** `20.02.2025 ; DPT KONTRIBUTE ; DEBIT ; SIGURIME 01/2025 ; -27,900 ; ALL`
**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- combined employer+employee contribution remittance (Section 3.1). Source: [PwC Albania -- Other taxes].

### Example 2 -- High earner above the social ceiling (2025)

**Scenario:** Employee on gross ALL 250,000/month (above the ALL 176,416 social ceiling).

**Reasoning:**
- Social base CAPPED at 176,416. Employee social 9.5% = 176,416 x 0.095 = **16,759.52**; employer social 15% = 176,416 x 0.15 = **26,462.40**.
- Health has NO ceiling, so health base = full 250,000. Employee health 1.7% = 4,250; employer health 1.7% = 4,250.
- Employee total = 16,759.52 + 4,250 = **21,009.52**.
- Employer total = 26,462.40 + 4,250 = **30,712.40**.

**Note:** Because social is capped but health is not, the employee total (21,009.52) is LESS than 11.2% of 250,000 (= 28,000). The cap only bites the social component. Source: [PwC; HLB Albania for the ALL 176,416 ceiling].

### Example 3 -- Salary below the minimum base (2025)

**Scenario:** Part-time/low-wage employee on gross ALL 30,000/month (below the ALL 40,000 floor).

**Reasoning:**
- Contributions are assessed on the MINIMUM base (40,000), not the lower actual 30,000 (conservative default; Tier 1 Rule 4).
- Social: employee 40,000 x 0.095 = 3,800; employer 40,000 x 0.15 = 6,000.
- Health: employee 40,000 x 0.017 = 680; employer 40,000 x 0.017 = 680.
- Employee total = 3,800 + 680 = **4,480**; employer total = 6,000 + 680 = **6,680**.

**Classification note:** Flag for reviewer -- confirm the employee is genuinely on a sub-minimum gross (e.g., legitimate part-time below the floor) versus an underdeclaration. Source: [HLB Albania for the ALL 40,000 floor].

### Example 4 -- Self-employed individual (2025)

**Scenario:** Self-employed (private) individual, 2025.

**Reasoning:**
- Social insurance: 23% on a base of at least the minimum salary (ALL 40,000) = 40,000 x 0.23 = **9,200/month**.
- Health insurance: 3.4% on a base of at least double the minimum salary (ALL 80,000) = 80,000 x 0.034 = **2,720/month**.
- Total self-employed contribution = 9,200 + 2,720 = **11,920/month**.

**Bank line:** `20.05.2025 ; TATIME ; DEBIT ; KONTRIBUTE I VETEPUNESUAR ; -11,920 ; ALL`
**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- self-employed contribution remittance (Section 3.1). Source: [PwC Albania -- Other taxes].

### Example 5 -- High earner above the social ceiling (2026)

**Scenario:** Employee on gross ALL 250,000/month in a 2026 period (social ceiling ALL 186,416 per PwC/HLB).

**Reasoning:**
- Social base CAPPED at 186,416. Employee social 9.5% = 186,416 x 0.095 = **17,709.52**; employer social 15% = 186,416 x 0.15 = **27,962.40**.
- Health (no ceiling) on full 250,000: employee 4,250; employer 4,250.
- Employee total = 17,709.52 + 4,250 = **21,959.52**; employer total = 27,962.40 + 4,250 = **32,212.40**.

**WARNING:** The 2026 maximum base of ALL 186,416 is DISPUTED (one source states ALL 220,520). Do NOT file this high-earner 2026 computation without confirming the ceiling against the published DCM No. 776 / Official Gazette (Refusal R-AL-SSC-2). Source: [PwC significant developments; HLB Albania].

### Example 6 -- Ambiguous DPT debit (contributions + PIT combined)

**Input line:**
`20.03.2025 ; DREJTORIA E TATIMEVE ; DEBIT ; PAGESA 02/2025 ; -45,000 ; ALL`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "DREJTORIA E TATIMEVE" (Section 3.2, Raiffeisen). A single monthly remittance to the DPT can bundle (a) withheld employee PIT, (b) employee social + health contributions, and (c) employer social + health contributions. The amount cannot be split into PIT vs contributions from the bank line alone -- the payroll declaration (Listepagesa / E-SIG 025) is needed.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag for reviewer -- request the E-SIG 025 payroll list to split PIT from social/health contributions. Source: [PwC -- employer withholds and remits PIT + contributions together].

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payroll data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written. All figures are sourced; any gap is marked.

### Rule 1 -- Employment contribution formulae

```
employee_social   = clamp(gross, min_base, social_ceiling) x 9.5%
employer_social   = clamp(gross, min_base, social_ceiling) x 15%
employee_health   = max(gross, min_base)                   x 1.7%   # NO ceiling
employer_health   = max(gross, min_base)                   x 1.7%   # NO ceiling
employee_total    = employee_social + employee_health   (= 11.2% within bounds)
employer_total    = employer_social + employer_health   (= 16.7% within bounds)
```

Source: [PwC Albania -- Other taxes].

### Rule 2 -- Contribution bases (2025)

Minimum base = ALL 40,000/month; maximum social-insurance base = ALL 176,416/month [HLB Albania]. Apply for any period through 31 December 2025.

### Rule 3 -- Contribution bases (2026)

From 1 January 2026: minimum base = ALL 50,000/month; maximum social-insurance base = ALL 186,416/month [PwC significant developments; HLB Albania]. The 2026 maximum is DISPUTED -- one firm summary of DCM No. 776 states ALL 220,520; use ALL 186,416 and flag (Conservative default; Refusal R-AL-SSC-2).

### Rule 4 -- Salary below the minimum base is grossed up to the minimum base

Contributions are assessed on the minimum base, not the lower actual salary. A sub-minimum gross still attracts contributions on ALL 40,000 (2025) / ALL 50,000 (2026) [conservative default, corroborated by min-base rule].

### Rule 5 -- Health insurance has NO ceiling

The 1.7% employee and 1.7% employer health contributions are assessed on full gross salary, floored at the minimum base only. The maximum (ceiling) applies ONLY to the 9.5%/15% social-insurance components [tax-checker / TPA; PwC].

### Rule 6 -- Self-employed social insurance

23% on a base of at least the minimum salary (ALL 40,000 in 2025; ALL 50,000 in 2026) [PwC].

### Rule 7 -- Self-employed health insurance

3.4% on a base of at least double the minimum salary (ALL 80,000 in 2025; ALL 100,000 in 2026) [PwC].

### Rule 8 -- Withholding and remittance

The employer withholds employee PIT plus employee social + health contributions and remits them together with the employer social + health contributions each month [PwC].

### Rule 9 -- Declaration and payment deadline

The monthly payroll declaration (Listepagesa / E-SIG 025), PIT, and social/health contributions must be filed and paid electronically by the 20th day of the following month [PwC].

### Rule 10 -- PIT is separate from contributions

Employment-income PIT is progressive (13% and 23% with a tax-free portion) under Law No. 29/2023, effective 1 Jan 2024 [PwC]. It is NOT a social contribution. The monthly PIT bands conflict across sources [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm] -- do not compute PIT in this skill.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When payroll data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- 2026 high-earner maximum base

**Trigger:** Salary above ALL 186,416/month in a 2026 period.
**Issue:** The 2026 social-insurance ceiling is disputed (PwC/HLB ALL 186,416 vs ARS summary ALL 220,520). The two cannot both be correct.
**Action:** Use ALL 186,416 and flag; do not file without confirming against DCM No. 776 / Official Gazette.

### T2-2 -- Sub-minimum gross salary

**Trigger:** Stated gross is below the minimum contribution base.
**Issue:** Contributions must be grossed up to the minimum base; a genuinely sub-minimum gross is unusual and may indicate part-time arrangements, underdeclaration, or a data error.
**Action:** Confirm the actual gross and the basis (Rule 4) with the reviewer.

### T2-3 -- Mixed employment and self-employment

**Trigger:** Individual is both employed and self-employed.
**Issue:** Interaction of the employee (11.2%) and self-employed (23% / 3.4%) regimes, and whether minimum bases overlap, is not fully specified in this research.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; do not net the two regimes without confirmation. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm overlap rules.]

### T2-4 -- Contribution arrears / late-payment penalties

**Trigger:** Unpaid contributions from prior months/years.
**Issue:** Penalty and interest figures under Law No. 9920/2008 were not confirmed from an authoritative source [RESEARCH GAP].
**Action:** Do not quantify. Escalate to an Albanian licensed accountant (Refusal R-AL-SSC-3).

### T2-5 -- Undeclared work / unregistered employees

**Trigger:** Workers not on the payroll declaration.
**Issue:** Significant fines apply for undeclared work; the exact figure is not confirmed here [RESEARCH GAP].
**Action:** Flag for reviewer; do not estimate the fine.

### T2-6 -- Bundled DPT remittance (PIT + contributions)

**Trigger:** A single DPT debit covers PIT and contributions together.
**Issue:** The bank line cannot be split without the E-SIG 025 payroll list.
**Action:** Request the payroll declaration; flag for reviewer (see Example 6).

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How contribution remittances appear on Albanian bank statements

**BKT (Banka Kombetare Tregtare):**
- Description: "DPT", "TATIME", "SIGURIME SHOQERORE"
- Timing: By the 20th of the month following the payroll month
- Amount: Combined employer + employee contributions (and often PIT bundled)

**Raiffeisen Bank Albania:**
- Description: "DREJTORIA E TATIMEVE", "KONTRIBUTE"
- Timing: Same monthly cycle

**Credins Bank / Intesa Sanpaolo Bank Albania:**
- Description: "TATIME", "SIGURIME", "DPT KONTRIBUTE", "SIGURIME SHENDETESORE"
- Timing: Same monthly cycle

**Albanian-language terms to recognise:**
- "Sigurime shoqerore" = social insurance contributions
- "Sigurime shendetesore" = health insurance contributions
- "Kontribute" = contributions
- "Listepagesa" = the monthly payroll list/declaration
- "Tatim mbi te ardhurat / TAP" = personal income tax (NOT a contribution)
- "Paga / rroga" = salary/wage
- "Pension / pensioni" = pension (benefit received, not a contribution)

**Key identification tips:**
1. Contribution remittances are always outgoing (DEBIT) to the DPT/tatime.
2. They recur monthly, due by the 20th of the following month.
3. A single DPT debit may bundle PIT + employee contributions + employer contributions -- request the E-SIG 025 list to split.
4. Do not confuse outbound DPT debits (contributions/PIT paid) with inbound pension/sickness/maternity credits (benefits received).
5. Within bounds, employee total = 11.2% and employer total = 16.7% of gross; above the social ceiling the social component caps but health does not.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for DPT/tatime debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns.
2. **Group by month** -- contributions are monthly, due by the 20th of the following month.
3. **Estimate the gross from the contribution** (within bounds, employer+employee combined = 27.9% of gross):
   - Implied gross ~= combined remittance / 0.279 (only valid if no PIT is bundled and salary is within bounds). Treat as a rough estimate only.
4. **Flag the floor/ceiling:**
   - If the combined remittance is small, the salary may be at/below the minimum base (ALL 40,000 in 2025 / ALL 50,000 in 2026).
   - If large, the social component may be capped at the ceiling (ALL 176,416 in 2025 / ALL 186,416 in 2026).
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution classification derived from bank-statement amounts only. Gross salary, period (2025 vs 2026 bases), and whether PIT is bundled have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm against the E-SIG 025 payroll list before filing."

### Contribution bases -- with provenance

| Item | 2025 | 2026 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly base | ALL 40,000 | ALL 50,000 | 2025: [HLB Albania]; 2026: [PwC significant developments] |
| Maximum social-insurance base | ALL 176,416 | ALL 186,416 (DISPUTED) | 2025: [HLB Albania]; 2026: [PwC + HLB] -- one source says ALL 220,520 [ARS] |
| Health insurance ceiling | None | None | [tax-checker / TPA] |
| Minimum wage | ALL 40,000 (since 1 Apr 2023) | ALL 50,000 (DCM No. 776, 19.12.2025) | 2025: [PwC]; 2026: [ARS / DCM No. 776] |
| Self-employed social base | >= ALL 40,000 | >= ALL 50,000 | [PwC] |
| Self-employed health base | >= ALL 80,000 (2x min) | >= ALL 100,000 (2x min) | [PwC] |

### Self-employed rates -- with provenance

| Component | Rate | Base (2025) | Base (2026) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance | 23% | >= ALL 40,000 | >= ALL 50,000 | [PwC] |
| Health insurance | 3.4% | >= ALL 80,000 | >= ALL 100,000 | [PwC] |

*Self-employed monthly check (2025): social 40,000 x 0.23 = 9,200; health 80,000 x 0.034 = 2,720; total 11,920. (2026): social 50,000 x 0.23 = 11,500; health 100,000 x 0.034 = 3,400; total 14,900.*

### Forms

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly payroll declaration (Listepagesa / E-SIG 025) | Declare salaries, withheld PIT, employer + employee social/health contributions | Electronically by the 20th of the following month | [PwC] |
| Annual individual income declaration (DIVA) | Annual personal income reconciliation for individuals above the filing threshold | By 31 March of the following year (verify threshold) [RESEARCH GAP -- threshold] | [PwC -- Tax administration] |

### Personal income tax (context only -- NOT this skill's scope)

Employment-income PIT under Law No. 29/2023 (effective 1 Jan 2024) is progressive with a tax-free portion, then 13%, then 23% above ~ALL 200,000/month [PwC -- Taxes on personal income]. The monthly tax-free threshold is reported variously as ALL 30,000-50,000 depending on salary level and the post-Constitutional-Court 2024-25 changes [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm monthly PIT bands]. Do not compute PIT here.

### Penalties

| Item | Detail | Source / status |
|---|---|---|
| Late declaration / late payment | Administrative penalties + late-payment interest under Law No. 9920/2008 (Tax Procedures); exact ALL/percentage figures not confirmed | [PwC -- Tax administration]; [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact figures] |
| Undeclared work / failure to register employees | Significant fines apply; exact figure not confirmed | [PwC]; [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm] |

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Employee, gross ALL 100,000/month, 2025. -> Employee social 9,500; employer social 15,000; employee health 1,700; employer health 1,700. Employee total = **11,200**; employer total = **16,700**; combined = **27,900**.

**Test 2:** Employee, gross ALL 250,000/month, 2025 (above ceiling 176,416). -> Employee social = 176,416 x 0.095 = **16,759.52**; employer social = 176,416 x 0.15 = **26,462.40**; employee health = 250,000 x 0.017 = **4,250**; employer health = **4,250**. Employee total = **21,009.52**; employer total = **30,712.40**.

**Test 3:** Employee, gross ALL 30,000/month, 2025 (below floor 40,000). -> Assess on min base 40,000. Employee social = 3,800; employer social = 6,000; employee health = 680; employer health = 680. Employee total = **4,480**; employer total = **6,680**.

**Test 4:** Self-employed, 2025. -> Social = 40,000 x 0.23 = **9,200**; health = 80,000 x 0.034 = **2,720**; total = **11,920**/month.

**Test 5:** Self-employed, 2026. -> Social = 50,000 x 0.23 = **11,500**; health = 100,000 x 0.034 = **3,400**; total = **14,900**/month.

**Test 6:** Employee, gross ALL 250,000/month, 2026 (above ceiling 186,416, PwC/HLB). -> Employee social = 186,416 x 0.095 = **17,709.52**; employer social = 186,416 x 0.15 = **27,962.40**; employee health = **4,250**; employer health = **4,250**. Employee total = **21,959.52**; employer total = **32,212.40**. FLAG: 2026 ceiling disputed.

**Test 7:** Employee, gross ALL 50,000/month, 2026 (within bounds: floor 50,000, ceiling 186,416). -> Employee social = 4,750; employer social = 7,500; employee health = 850; employer health = 850. Employee total = **5,600** (= 11.2%); employer total = **8,350** (= 16.7%).

**Test 8:** Bundled DPT debit ALL 45,000, single line, no payroll list. -> Cannot split PIT from contributions. EXCLUDE from VAT; request E-SIG 025; flag for reviewer.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute contributions without knowing employment status (employee vs self-employed).
- NEVER apply the social ceiling to the health components -- health (1.7%/1.7%) has NO ceiling.
- NEVER assess contributions on a sub-minimum gross -- gross up to the minimum base.
- NEVER rely on the 2026 maximum base (ALL 186,416) for a high earner without confirming against DCM No. 776 / Official Gazette -- it is disputed.
- NEVER quantify late-payment or undeclared-work penalties -- the figures are unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP]; escalate.
- NEVER compute PIT in this skill -- the monthly bands conflict across sources; use a dedicated PIT skill.
- NEVER treat employer contributions as the same line as withheld employee contributions -- they are distinct (16.7% vs 11.2%).
- NEVER confuse inbound benefits (pension, sickness, maternity) with outbound contributions.
- NEVER present contribution figures as definitive -- label as estimated and direct the client to their E-SIG 025 payroll list and DPT/e-Albania account.
- NEVER use secondary aggregator base figures (e.g., ALL 22,000/95,130 or ALL 45,000/310,000) -- they conflict with PwC/HLB and appear erroneous.

**Caveats (read before relying on 2026 figures):** The 2026 MAXIMUM social-insurance base is DISPUTED. PwC (reviewed Feb 2026) and HLB Albania state ALL 186,416 (same absolute +ALL 10,000 increase as the minimum wage); one firm summary (ARS) of DCM No. 776 states ALL 220,520 (25% proportional indexation matching the 40,000->50,000 minimum-wage rise). These cannot both be correct -- confirm against the published DCM No. 776 / Official Gazette before relying on the 2026 maximum. The 2025 figures (min ALL 40,000 / max ALL 176,416) are well-corroborated (high confidence). Penalty amounts and interest rates under Law No. 9920/2008 are not confirmed (low confidence) [RESEARCH GAP]. PIT monthly bands conflict across sources and are out of scope here. Confirm exact form codes (Listepagesa / E-SIG 025) with the e-Filing / e-Albania portal. Overall confidence: medium.
