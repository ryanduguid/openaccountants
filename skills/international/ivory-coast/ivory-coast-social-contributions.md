**Branch overview (private-sector salaried, régime général):**

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Total | Monthly ceiling (assiette max) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Assurance Vieillesse (pension/retraite) | 6.3% | 7.7% | 14% | XOF 3,375,000 |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown AT/MP risk category | Use 2% (lowest band); flag for reviewer to confirm employer's assigned category |
| Unknown headcount (monthly vs quarterly) | Assume <20 → quarterly; flag to confirm |
| Salary below SMIG (XOF 75,000) | Apply the SMIG floor (plancher) to ALL branches; do not contribute on the lower figure |
| Pension ceiling in any source citing 1,647,315 or 2,700,000 | REJECT — use XOF 3,375,000 (current since 1 Jan 2023) |
| Unknown number of CMU dependants | Compute CMU on the employee only (500 + 500); flag to confirm covered persons |
| Benefits-in-kind / indemnities | Include in the assiette (art. 23) UNLESS they are genuine expense reimbursements |
| Self-employed (RSTI) query | STOP — this skill is the régime général (salaried); RSTI uses different rates/bases. Flag for reviewer |

---

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly salary (brut) per employee, and the period (month/quarter). Without gross salary, STOP. Do not compute contributions.

**Recommended** — employer's AT/MP risk category (1–4), total headcount (determines monthly vs quarterly payment), and number of CMU-covered persons per employee.

**Ideal** — the CNPS appel de cotisations, the employer's immatriculation number, benefits-in-kind breakdown, and the prior DISA/DASC for reconciliation.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-CI-CNPS-1 — Self-employed / RSTI.** *Trigger:* query concerns a self-employed person, independent worker, or RSTI registrant. *Message:* "This skill covers the salaried régime général only. The Régime Social des Travailleurs Indépendants (RSTI) uses category-based floors (XOF 30,000–150,000), a 12% rate (9% retirement + 3% other risks), and a different supplementary retirement rule. Do not apply régime général rates. Escalate to a warranted Ivorian accountant."

**R-CI-CNPS-2 — Outdated ceiling.** *Trigger:* a source, prior workpaper, or the user states the pension ceiling is XOF 1,647,315 or XOF 2,700,000. *Message:* "Those are defunct ceilings. 1,647,315 is a legacy pre-2014 figure; 2,700,000 was 45 × 60,000 (2018 leaflet). The current pension ceiling since 1 January 2023 (décret 2022-986) is XOF 3,375,000 = 45 × SMIG (75,000). Use 3,375,000."

**R-CI-CNPS-3 — Contribution arrears / penalties.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid CNPS contributions from prior periods. *Message:* "Arrears attract a 10% penalty plus majorations de retard, computed from the CNPS appel and statement. Do not estimate arrears without the official CNPS statement. Escalate to a warranted accountant."

**R-CI-CNPS-4 — AT/MP risk category determination.** *Trigger:* user asks you to assign the work-injury risk category (and thus the 2%–5% rate). *Message:* "The AT/MP category is set per employer by CNPS based on sector/activity (4 categories). It cannot be self-assigned from the skill. Use 2% as a conservative placeholder and flag for reviewer to confirm the employer's official category."

**R-CI-CNPS-5 — Public-sector / IPS-CGRAE.** *Trigger:* employee is a civil servant or state employee. *Message:* "State employees fall under IPS-CGRAE, not CNPS régime général. This skill does not cover that scheme. Escalate to a warranted accountant."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank-statement and payroll transactions related to CNPS social contributions. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the statement. CNPS contribution payments always EXCLUDE from any VAT/TVA return — they are statutory social charges, not taxable supplies. Employer contributions are a deductible payroll cost; the employee share is withheld from gross pay.

### 3.1 CNPS contribution débits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNPS, PREVOYANCE SOCIALE | EXCLUDE — CNPS contribution | Monthly/quarterly appel de cotisations |
| COTISATION SOCIALE, COTISATIONS CNPS | EXCLUDE — CNPS contribution | Same |
| RETRAITE CNPS, ASSURANCE VIEILLESSE | EXCLUDE — pension branch | Pension portion |
| PRESTATIONS FAMILIALES, ALLOC FAMILIALES | EXCLUDE — family-benefits branch | Employer-only |
| ACCIDENT TRAVAIL, AT/MP | EXCLUDE — work-injury branch | Employer-only |
| APPEL DE COTISATIONS | EXCLUDE — CNPS contribution | The CNPS billing reference |

### 3.2 CMU (health) débits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CMU, COUVERTURE MALADIE UNIVERSELLE | EXCLUDE — CMU health contribution | Flat XOF 500 + 500 per person/month |
| CNAM | EXCLUDE — CMU health | Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie (CMU manager) |

### 3.3 CNPS débits appearing on specific Ivorian banks

| Bank | Typical débit description | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| SGCI (Société Générale CI) | "CNPS COTISATIONS" or "PREVOYANCE SOCIALE" | EXCLUDE — CNPS |
| BICICI | "CNPS" or "COTIS SOCIALES" | EXCLUDE — CNPS |
| Ecobank CI | "CNPS COTISATION" or "PREVOYANCE" | EXCLUDE — CNPS |
| NSIA Banque | "CNPS" or "COTISATION SOCIALE" | EXCLUDE — CNPS |
| Coris Bank | "CNPS" or "APPEL COTISATIONS" | EXCLUDE — CNPS |

### 3.4 Tax payments (NOT social contributions — do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DGI, DIRECTION GENERALE DES IMPOTS | EXCLUDE — tax, not CNPS | Income/payroll tax (ITS, etc.), not social security |
| ITS, IMPOT SUR SALAIRES | EXCLUDE — payroll tax | Not a CNPS contribution |
| TVA | EXCLUDE — VAT | Not a CNPS contribution |

### 3.5 Salary and benefit payments (exclude from CNPS classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, VIREMENT SALAIRE (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll expense | Not a contribution payment |
| PENSION CNPS, RENTE (incoming/received) | EXCLUDE — benefit received | Not a contribution paid |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six classifications and computations for a hypothetical Ivorian SME employer in Abidjan. All amounts in XOF. AT/MP category assumed at 3% (a mid-band manufacturing risk) unless stated. Every figure reconciles to the unit.

### Example 1 — Employee paid exactly at the SMIG floor (XOF 75,000/month)

**Input:** Gross monthly salary = XOF 75,000. AT/MP = 3%.

**Reasoning:** Salary equals the SMIG, so floor = base for all branches; pension base is also 75,000 (well below the 3,375,000 ceiling).

| Branch | Base | Rate | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vieillesse | 75,000 | 6.3% / 7.7% | 4,725.00 | 5,775.00 |
| Prestations familiales | 75,000 | 5% | — | 3,750.00 |
| Maternité | 75,000 | 0.75% | — | 562.50 |
| AT/MP | 75,000 | 3% | — | 2,250.00 |
| CMU | flat | 500/500 | 500.00 | 500.00 |
| **Total** | | | **5,225.00** | **12,837.50** |

Employer % load on the 75,000 base (excl. flat CMU) = 7.7 + 5 + 0.75 + 3 = 16.45% → 12,337.50, plus CMU 500 = 12,837.50. Reconciles.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Employer total 12,837.50 is a deductible payroll cost; employee 5,225.00 withheld from gross.

### Example 2 — Mid-range salary, below pension ceiling (XOF 500,000/month)

**Input:** Gross monthly salary = XOF 500,000. AT/MP = 3%.

**Reasoning:** 500,000 is above the SMIG floor and below the 3,375,000 pension ceiling, so pension applies to the full 500,000. PF/Maternité/AT-MP are capped at 75,000.

| Branch | Base | Rate | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vieillesse | 500,000 | 6.3% / 7.7% | 31,500.00 | 38,500.00 |
| Prestations familiales | 75,000 (cap) | 5% | — | 3,750.00 |
| Maternité | 75,000 (cap) | 0.75% | — | 562.50 |
| AT/MP | 75,000 (cap) | 3% | — | 2,250.00 |
| CMU | flat | 500/500 | 500.00 | 500.00 |
| **Total** | | | **32,000.00** | **45,562.50** |

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Employer 45,562.50 deductible; employee 32,000.00 withheld.

### Example 3 — High earner above the pension ceiling (XOF 5,000,000/month)

**Input:** Gross monthly salary = XOF 5,000,000. AT/MP = 3%.

**Reasoning:** Salary exceeds the pension ceiling, so the pension base is capped at XOF 3,375,000. PF/Maternité/AT-MP remain capped at 75,000.

| Branch | Base | Rate | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vieillesse | 3,375,000 (cap) | 6.3% / 7.7% | 212,625.00 | 259,875.00 |
| Prestations familiales | 75,000 (cap) | 5% | — | 3,750.00 |
| Maternité | 75,000 (cap) | 0.75% | — | 562.50 |
| AT/MP | 75,000 (cap) | 3% | — | 2,250.00 |
| CMU | flat | 500/500 | 500.00 | 500.00 |
| **Total** | | | **213,125.00** | **266,937.50** |

Pension cap check: 3,375,000 × 6.3% = 212,625.00; × 7.7% = 259,875.00. Reconciles. Note: had a source used the wrong 1,647,315 ceiling, employee pension would be only 103,780.85 — materially understated. Use 3,375,000.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Employer 266,937.50 deductible; employee 213,125.00 withheld.

### Example 4 — DGI/ITS débit (NOT a CNPS contribution)

**Input line:**
`15.04.2025 ; DIRECTION GENERALE DES IMPOTS ; DEBIT ; ITS MARS 2025 ; -185,000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:** Matches "DIRECTION GENERALE DES IMPOTS" / "ITS" (pattern 3.4). This is payroll tax (impôt sur salaires) paid to the DGI, NOT a CNPS social contribution. Do not classify under CNPS branches.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Payroll tax (DGI), NOT a CNPS contribution.

### Example 5 — Salary above floor with low AT/MP category (XOF 200,000, AT/MP = 2%)

**Input:** Gross monthly salary = XOF 200,000. AT/MP = 2% (Category 1, low risk).

**Reasoning:** Above SMIG floor, below pension ceiling. Pension on full 200,000; other branches capped at 75,000 at the 2% AT/MP rate.

| Branch | Base | Rate | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Vieillesse | 200,000 | 6.3% / 7.7% | 12,600.00 | 15,400.00 |
| Prestations familiales | 75,000 (cap) | 5% | — | 3,750.00 |
| Maternité | 75,000 (cap) | 0.75% | — | 562.50 |
| AT/MP | 75,000 (cap) | 2% | — | 1,500.00 |
| CMU | flat | 500/500 | 500.00 | 500.00 |
| **Total** | | | **13,100.00** | **21,712.50** |

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Employer 21,712.50 deductible; employee 13,100.00 withheld.

### Example 6 — Ambiguous CNPS lump-sum (arrears or penalty)

**Input line:**
`20.07.2025 ; CNPS PREVOYANCE SOCIALE ; DEBIT ; REGULARISATION ; -1,450,000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning:** Matches "CNPS PREVOYANCE SOCIALE" (pattern 3.1) but the amount is irregular and the reference says "REGULARISATION." This may bundle contribution principal with a 10% penalty plus majorations de retard. Cannot separate principal from penalty without the CNPS appel/statement.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from TVA. Flag for reviewer — request the CNPS breakdown to split contribution principal (deductible payroll cost) from penalties/majorations (treat per reviewer guidance).

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payroll/bank data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 — Branch formulas (per employee, per month)

```
floor          = XOF 75,000                       (SMIG plancher, all branches)
pension_base   = clamp(gross_salary, 75,000, 3,375,000)
other_base     = clamp(gross_salary, 75,000, 75,000) = 75,000   (PF / Maternité / AT-MP capped at SMIG)

Pension EE     = pension_base × 6.3%
Pension ER     = pension_base × 7.7%
Family (PF)    = 75,000 × 5%          (employer only)
Maternity      = 75,000 × 0.75%       (employer only)
AT/MP          = 75,000 × rate        (employer only; rate 2%–5% by risk category)
CMU EE         = XOF 500 per covered person   (flat)
CMU ER         = XOF 500 per covered person   (flat)
```

### Rule 2 — Pension ceiling is XOF 3,375,000

The vieillesse ceiling is 45 × SMIG = 45 × 75,000 = **XOF 3,375,000/month** (décret 2022-986, since 1 Jan 2023). REJECT 1,647,315 (legacy) and 2,700,000 (2018 leaflet, 45 × 60,000). Only pension uses this ceiling; all other branches are capped at the SMIG (75,000).

### Rule 3 — SMIG is the floor for every branch

XOF 75,000/month is the contribution floor (plancher). If gross salary < 75,000, contribute on 75,000, never on the lower figure. (Apprentices under contract: ½ SMIG; otherwise full SMIG — confirm with reviewer.)

### Rule 4 — Employee bears pension + CMU only

The only employee deductions are pension 6.3% and CMU XOF 500/person. Family benefits, maternity, and AT/MP are 100% employer-borne. Never deduct PF/Maternité/AT-MP from the employee.

### Rule 5 — Assiette (contribution base)

The base is total salary including benefits-in-kind and indemnities (art. 23), EXCEPT genuine expense reimbursements (frais professionnels réels). Include before applying the floor/ceiling clamp.

### Rule 6 — AT/MP rate by risk category

The work-injury rate is 2%–5%, set per employer by CNPS across 4 sector/risk categories (Cat. 1 ≈ 2% … Cat. 4 e.g. construction ≈ 5%). Do not invent the category — use the employer's CNPS-assigned rate; default to 2% and flag if unknown.

### Rule 7 — CMU is flat, per covered person

CMU is XOF 500 employee + XOF 500 employer per person per month (XOF 1,000 total/person). It is NOT a percentage of salary. Count each covered person (employee + declared dependants).

### Rule 8 — Payment periodicity

| Headcount | Periodicity | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| ≥ 20 employees | Monthly | First 15 days after month-end |
| < 20 employees | Quarterly | First 15 days after quarter-end |

### Rule 9 — Annual regularisation (DISA / DASC)

File the DISA (Déclaration Individuelle des Salaires Annuels) and DASC (Déclaration Annuelle des Salaires et Cotisations) no later than **31 March** of the following year (art. 26). CNPS provides free e-DISA software. Declarations are filed exclusively online via e.cnps.ci.

### Rule 10 — Late penalty

Late payment attracts a **10% penalty** of the contributions due (art. 30 / default), plus majorations de retard (late-payment surcharges). Do not estimate penalties without the CNPS statement.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When payroll data is ambiguous or circumstances are unclear, flag these situations for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 — AT/MP category uncertainty

**Trigger:** The employer's work-injury risk category is unknown or disputed.

**Issue:** The rate swings from 2% to 5% — a 3-point spread on the 75,000 base (XOF 1,500 vs 3,750/employee/month).

**Action:** Use 2% as a conservative placeholder, label it, and flag for reviewer to confirm the CNPS-assigned category.

### T2-2 — Headcount near the 20-employee threshold

**Trigger:** Employer hovers around 20 employees during the year (seasonal/temp staff).

**Issue:** Crossing 20 switches the obligation from quarterly to monthly payment; misclassification risks late-payment penalties.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer to confirm the headcount basis and effective periodicity.

### T2-3 — Benefits-in-kind and indemnities in the assiette

**Trigger:** Employee receives housing, vehicle, or allowances alongside cash salary.

**Issue:** Benefits-in-kind and indemnities are contributory (art. 23) unless they are genuine expense reimbursements. Misclassifying a reimbursement as salary (or vice versa) shifts the base.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer to confirm which amounts are genuine frais professionnels.

### T2-4 — Contribution arrears / régularisation

**Trigger:** Unpaid CNPS contributions from prior periods.

**Issue:** Arrears carry a 10% penalty plus majorations de retard. Principal and penalty must be separated for accounting.

**Action:** Do not estimate. Request the CNPS appel/statement and escalate to a warranted accountant.

### T2-5 — Salary above the pension ceiling

**Trigger:** Employee earns more than XOF 3,375,000/month.

**Issue:** Pension is capped at 3,375,000; the excess is NOT contributory for pension. A source citing 1,647,315 or 2,700,000 would understate the base.

**Action:** Apply the 3,375,000 cap. Flag if any input source quoted a different ceiling.

### T2-6 — Self-employed / RSTI or public-sector employee

**Trigger:** Worker is self-employed (RSTI) or a civil servant (IPS-CGRAE).

**Issue:** Different scheme, rates, and bases entirely. The régime général rates do not apply.

**Action:** STOP. Escalate to a warranted accountant. Do not compute with this skill's rates.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How CNPS débits appear on Ivorian bank statements

**SGCI (Société Générale Côte d'Ivoire):**
- Description: "CNPS COTISATIONS" or "PREVOYANCE SOCIALE"
- Timing: Within 15 days after month-end (≥20 staff) or quarter-end (<20 staff)
- Amount: Sum of all branches across declared employees

**BICICI / Ecobank CI / NSIA / Coris:**
- Description: "CNPS", "COTISATION SOCIALE", "APPEL COTISATIONS", or "PREVOYANCE"
- Timing: Same monthly/quarterly cycle
- Amount: Matches the CNPS appel de cotisations

**CMU débits:**
- Description: "CMU", "COUVERTURE MALADIE UNIVERSELLE", or "CNAM"
- Amount: XOF 1,000 × number of covered persons (500 EE + 500 ER)

**Key identification tips:**
1. CNPS contribution débits are always outgoing, never credits (an incoming "PENSION CNPS" is a benefit received, not a contribution).
2. They recur monthly or quarterly with amounts tied to the appel de cotisations.
3. Do not confuse with DGI/ITS débits (payroll tax) or TVA (VAT) — those are tax, not social security.
4. Régularisation lump sums may bundle principal with the 10% penalty + majorations — flag for breakdown.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the employer provides only a bank statement and no payroll detail:

1. **Scan for CNPS débits** — identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns.
2. **Sum contributions paid** — total all CNPS and CMU débits in the period.
3. **Reverse-engineer roughly:**
   - Employer load on the first XOF 75,000 per employee ≈ 16.45%–18.45% (7.7% pension + 5% PF + 0.75% maternity + 2%–5% AT/MP) plus flat CMU.
   - Above 75,000 (up to 3,375,000), only the 7.7% employer / 6.3% employee pension continues.
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "CNPS classification derived from bank-statement amounts only. AT/MP category, headcount basis, and per-employee assiette have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm against the CNPS appel before filing the DISA/DASC."

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### Calculation examples (2025, AT/MP at 3% unless noted)

| Gross monthly salary | Pension base | Pension EE (6.3%) | Pension ER (7.7%) | Employer other branches (5% + 0.75% + AT%) on 75,000 | CMU (EE/ER) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| XOF 75,000 | 75,000 | 4,725.00 | 5,775.00 | 6,562.50 (@3%) | 500 / 500 |
| XOF 200,000 | 200,000 | 12,600.00 | 15,400.00 | 5,812.50 (@2%) | 500 / 500 |
| XOF 500,000 | 500,000 | 31,500.00 | 38,500.00 | 6,562.50 (@3%) | 500 / 500 |
| XOF 3,375,000 | 3,375,000 | 212,625.00 | 259,875.00 | 6,562.50 (@3%) | 500 / 500 |
| XOF 5,000,000 | 3,375,000 (cap) | 212,625.00 | 259,875.00 | 6,562.50 (@3%) | 500 / 500 |

"Other branches" at 3% = 75,000 × (5% + 0.75% + 3%) = 75,000 × 8.75% = 6,562.50. At 2% = 75,000 × 7.75% = 5,812.50. Reconciles.

### Self-employed (RSTI) — out of scope, for awareness only

12% (9% retirement + 3% other risks) on a category-based floor (XOF 30,000–150,000); +9% supplementary retirement on income above XOF 180,000; CMU XOF 1,000/month; no pension ceiling like the régime général. Do NOT apply these to salaried employees. [Use the RSTI workflow / escalate.]

### Registration and forms

- **Employer immatriculation:** "Déclaration aux fins d'immatriculation" via GUFE/CEPICI at company creation or at a CNPS agency; effective from first hire (art. 5).
- **Employee declaration:** "fiche de déclaration du travailleur" via CEPICI, e-CNPS, or agency; effective first day of work.
- **Cessation:** "fiche de déclaration de cessation d'emploi" on departure.

### Penalties

| Item | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Late payment | 10% of contributions due |
| Late-payment surcharge | Majorations de retard (per CNPS statement) |
| Non-declaration | All unpaid contributions + penalties recoverable by CNPS |

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Gross XOF 75,000, AT/MP 3%. → Pension EE 4,725.00 / ER 5,775.00; PF 3,750.00; Maternité 562.50; AT/MP 2,250.00; CMU 500/500. Employee total 5,225.00; Employer total 12,837.50.

**Test 5:** Gross XOF 50,000 (below SMIG). → Apply floor 75,000. Same as Test 1. Never contribute on 50,000.

**Test 6:** Source quotes pension ceiling 1,647,315. → REJECT. Use 3,375,000.

**Test 7:** Employer with 30 employees. → Monthly payment, due within 15 days of month-end.

**Test 8:** Employer with 8 employees. → Quarterly payment, due within 15 days of quarter-end. DISA/DASC by 31 March following.

**Test 9:** Pension exactly at ceiling, gross XOF 3,375,000. → EE 212,625.00 / ER 259,875.00 (no excess contributory).

### Prohibitions

- NEVER use the XOF 1,647,315 or 2,700,000 pension ceiling — the current ceiling is XOF 3,375,000.
- NEVER contribute on a salary below the XOF 75,000 SMIG floor — always apply the floor.
- NEVER apply the pension ceiling (3,375,000) to PF/Maternité/AT-MP — those are capped at 75,000.
- NEVER deduct family benefits, maternity, or AT/MP from the employee — they are employer-only.
- NEVER compute CMU as a percentage — it is flat XOF 500 + 500 per covered person.
- NEVER invent the AT/MP risk category — use the employer's CNPS-assigned rate; default 2% and flag.
- NEVER apply régime général rates to a self-employed (RSTI) or public-sector (IPS-CGRAE) worker.
- NEVER estimate arrears or penalties without the CNPS appel/statement.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — label as estimated and direct the client to their CNPS appel de cotisations.
