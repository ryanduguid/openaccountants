> **Reform alert.** Ordonnance n° 2023-719 (13 Sept 2023) merged the three former salary taxes — the proportional IS, the Contribution Nationale (CN), and the IGR — into a **single progressive ITS**, effective **1 January 2024**. The old "IGR + CN + IS" stack that many legacy calculators still show is **OBSOLETE**. Do NOT use it.

## Section 2 — Income Tax Withholding (ITS)

The employer withholds the **ITS** monthly at source on each employee's gross taxable salary (cash pay plus benefits in kind), applies the progressive scale, then deducts the fixed RICF family-charge reduction, and remits the net to the DGI.

### 2.1 Progressive Monthly Scale — CGI Article 119 bis (current, 2024–)

| Monthly taxable income (XOF) | Marginal rate | Cumulative ITS at top of band (XOF) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — 75,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 75,001 — 240,000 | 16% | 26,400 |
| 240,001 — 800,000 | 21% | 144,000 |
| 800,001 — 2,400,000 | 24% | 528,000 |
| 2,400,001 — 8,000,000 | 28% | 2,096,000 |
| Above 8,000,000 | 32% | — (no ceiling) |

Source: CGI Art. 119 bis, reproduced at loidici.biz (https://loidici.biz/2025/02/21/67781/), and PwC Ivory Coast (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ivory-coast/individual/taxes-on-personal-income). The 0% floor of 75,000 XOF coincides exactly with the SMIG.

**Cumulative-tax arithmetic (self-checked):**
- 75,000 → 0
- 240,000 → 0 + 16% × 165,000 = 26,400
- 800,000 → 26,400 + 21% × 560,000 = 144,000
- 2,400,000 → 144,000 + 24% × 1,600,000 = 528,000
- 8,000,000 → 528,000 + 28% × 5,600,000 = 2,096,000

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` **Professional abatement.** The pre-reform regime applied a 20% professional abatement before the old scale. Under the unified ITS, PwC presents the scale as applied to **gross** taxable salary, and this skill follows that (no standalone abatement). A separate abatement percentage under the new law could **not** be confirmed from a primary source (the DGI/Deloitte rate images did not render to text). Reviewer must confirm whether any abatement still applies before signing off.

### 2.2 Family-Charge Reduction — RICF, CGI Article 120

The Réduction d'Impôt pour Charges de Famille (RICF) replaces the old family-quotient system. It is a **fixed XOF amount subtracted from the gross monthly ITS** — NOT a percentage. Parts run from 1 to 5: the employee receives 1 part, +0.5 part per dependent child (and the configuration of the household), up to a maximum of 5 parts.

| Parts | Monthly reduction (XOF) | Annual reduction (XOF) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 | 0 |
| 1.5 | 5,500 | 66,000 |
| 2 | 11,000 | 132,000 |
| 2.5 | 16,500 | 198,000 |
| 3 | 22,000 | 264,000 |
| 3.5 | 27,500 | 330,000 |
| 4 | 33,000 | 396,000 |
| 4.5 | 38,500 | 462,000 |
| 5 | 44,000 | 528,000 |

Rule: 11,000 XOF/month per additional full part, 5,500 XOF per half-part. Source: CGI Art. 120 via loidici.biz (https://loidici.biz/2025/02/21/67781/).

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` The annual figure for 5 parts rendered inconsistently in one extraction (showed "328,000"). **528,000** is the arithmetically consistent value (44,000 × 12 = 528,000) and is used here, but the reviewer must confirm against the official CGI text.

**Net ITS = gross ITS (from §2.1 scale) − RICF reduction (from §2.2 table), floored at 0.**

### 2.3 ITS Filing & Payment

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Withholding | Monthly at source by employer | CGI Art. 119 bis / DGI |
| Declaration & payment | By the **15th of the following month** via e-Impôts ([e-impots.gouv.ci](https://e-impots.gouv.ci/)) | DGI fiscal calendar (CALENDRIER.pdf); corroborated by multiple guides |
| Small-withholding option (CGI Art. 138) | If monthly ITS ≤ 1,000 XOF, may pay semi-annually (by 15 Jul / 15 Jan). But if in any month the amount exceeds 5,000 XOF, all sums due for the current semester fall due within the first 15 days of the following month. | CGI Art. 138 |
| Late penalty | 25% surcharge on the amount due, **plus** 2% interest per month of delay | DGI / PwC |

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` The DGI calendar PDF did not render to text, so whether the ITS deadline shifts by taxpayer regime (DGE large enterprises vs CME/SME) is unconfirmed. The commonly cited date is the **15th of the following month**.

## Section 3 — CNPS Social Contributions (effective 1 January 2025)

CNPS contributions are split across five branches. Two distinct monthly base ceilings apply: **3,375,000 XOF** for retirement; **70,000 XOF** for family allowances, maternity, and work-injury. CMU is a flat per-person amount.

### 3.1 Contribution Table (effective 1 Jan 2025)

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Total | Monthly base ceiling (XOF) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Retirement / old-age (assurance vieillesse) | 6.30% | 7.70% | 14.00% | 3,375,000 |
| Family allowances (prestations familiales) | 0% | 5.00% | 5.00% | 70,000 |
| Maternity (assurance maternité) | 0% | 0.75% | 0.75% | 70,000 |
| Work injury / occupational disease (AT/MP) | 0% | 2%–5% (by sector risk) | 2%–5% | 70,000 |
| CMU (universal health coverage) | 500 XOF/person/mo (flat) | 500 XOF/person/mo (flat) | 1,000 XOF/person/mo | flat (no %) |

Source: CLEISS — Les cotisations en Côte d'Ivoire, effective 1 Jan 2025 (https://www.cleiss.fr/docs/cotisations/cotedivoire.html); PwC Ivory Coast — Other taxes (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ivory-coast/individual/other-taxes); CNPS (https://www.cnps.ci/).

**Percentage totals (self-checked, excluding flat CMU and excluding the variable AT/MP range):**
- **Employee %:** 6.30% (retirement only).
- **Employer %:** 7.70% (retirement) + 5.00% (family) + 0.75% (maternity) + AT/MP (2%–5%) = **15.45% to 18.45%**.
- Family + maternity are frequently quoted together as **5.75%** (5.00% + 0.75%), entirely employer-borne.
- Plus 500 XOF/person CMU on each side (flat).

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` The **AT/MP work-injury rate is sector-specific (2%–5%)**, set by the employer's CNPS risk classification. The exact rate for a given employer must be confirmed from its CNPS notification before payroll is finalised. Worked examples below assume a placeholder; reviewer to substitute the real rate.

### 3.2 CNPS Filing & Payment

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Periodicity | **Monthly** if ≥ 20 employees; **quarterly** if < 20 employees | CLEISS |
| Deadline | Within the first **15 days** following the month/quarter end | CLEISS |
| Filing channel | Online via e-CNPS (https://e.cnps.ci/) | CNPS |
| DISA (Déclaration Individuelle des Salaires Annuels) | Annual salary declaration due **by 31 March** of the following year | CNPS DISA form |
| Late penalty (contributions) | **5%** surcharge for the first month, then **1%** per additional month | CLEISS |
| DISA non-filing penalty | **10%** of total monthly contributions due | CNPS / CLEISS |

## Section 4 — Employer Payroll Tax (Contribution Employeur / Taxe sur Salaires)

A separate employer-only tax on total taxable remuneration (salaries + benefits + benefits in kind):

| Category | Rate |
|---|---|
| Local employees | 2.8% |
| Expatriate employees | 12% |

Source: PwC Ivory Coast — Corporate — Other taxes (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/ivory-coast/corporate/other-taxes); confirmed on PwC individual/other-taxes.

> **Expatriate definition.** "Expatriate" status follows from an expatriate employment contract approved by the Agence Emploi Jeune (AEJ) — it is determined by **contract type, not strictly nationality**. Confirm the contract classification before applying the 12% rate.

---

## Section 5 — FDFP Training Levies (employer-borne, on total payroll / masse salariale)

Managed by the Fonds de Développement de la Formation Professionnelle (FDFP):

| Levy | Rate |
|---|---|
| Taxe d'apprentissage (apprenticeship tax) | 0.4% of payroll |
| Taxe additionnelle à la formation professionnelle continue (continuing vocational training) | 1.2% of payroll |

Source: FDFP via eRegulations CI (https://cotedivoire.eregulations.org/media/taxe%20fdfp.pdf); FDFP (https://fdfp.ci/presentation-du-fdfp/).

Combined FDFP employer cost: **1.6%** of payroll (0.4% + 1.2%).

---

## Section 6 — Minimum Wage (SMIG / SMAG)

| Category | Monthly amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| SMIG (general minimum wage) | 75,000 XOF | Decree n° 2022-986 of 21 Dec 2022, in force since 1 Jan 2023 |
| SMAG (agricultural minimum wage) | 39,960 XOF | Decree n° 2022-986 |

Source: secondary (guidedufonctionnaire.com, citing Decree n° 2022-986). The 75,000 XOF SMIG aligns exactly with the ITS 0% threshold and is widely corroborated; unchanged through 2025/2026 as of latest reporting.

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` Only secondary sources were fetched for the SMIG/SMAG amounts. Confirm against the official decree text.

---

## Section 7 — Conservative Defaults

When a required input is ambiguous or missing, apply the **most cautious** assumption and flag it. Never silently pick a favourable value.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Number of RICF parts | **1 part (zero reduction)** | Never assume dependants; under-claiming RICF over-withholds ITS (employee can reclaim), over-claiming under-withholds (employer liable). |
| Employee/expatriate status | **Expatriate (12% employer payroll tax)** only if a contract clearly shows AEJ-approved expatriate terms; otherwise default to **local (2.8%)** and flag for confirmation | 12% should not be applied without contract evidence; but flag because misclassification cuts both ways. |
| AT/MP work-injury rate | **5% (top of band)** for accrual until the CNPS risk-class notification is sighted | Avoids under-accruing the employer liability. |
| Benefits in kind | **Include in ITS taxable base and employer-payroll-tax base** unless proven exempt | The scale applies to gross including benefits in kind. |
| Professional abatement | **Apply none** (scale on gross) per PwC | See §2.1 research gap; conservative = no abatement = higher withholding. |
| Filing periodicity | If headcount unknown, assume **monthly** CNPS filing | Monthly is stricter than quarterly. |
| Pay currency | **XOF/FCFA** — refuse any other currency | No foreign-currency payroll. |

---

## Section 8 — Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

### 8.1 Required Inputs

Before computing, you MUST have:

1. **Gross monthly remuneration in XOF** (cash + allowances + benefits in kind).
2. **RICF parts** (or the data to derive them: marital configuration + number of dependent children).
3. **Local vs expatriate status** (contract classification per AEJ).
4. **Employer headcount** (to set CNPS periodicity: ≥20 monthly, <20 quarterly).
5. **CNPS AT/MP risk-class rate** for the employer (2%–5%).
6. **Number of CMU-covered persons** per employee (for the flat 500 XOF/person each side).

### 8.2 Refusal Catalogue — STOP and refuse if:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Remuneration given in EUR, USD, or any non-XOF currency | Refuse; request XOF figures. No FX conversion in payroll. |
| Pre-2024 "IGR + CN + IS" stack requested | Refuse the obsolete method; explain the 2024 ITS reform (Ord. 2023-719) and offer the unified ITS. |
| Asked to apply the 12% expatriate rate without contract evidence | Refuse; require AEJ contract classification. |
| Asked to skip CNPS or FDFP "to save cost" | Refuse; these are statutory employer obligations. |
| Asked to treat ITS/CNPS as final without accountant sign-off | Refuse to label as final; output is Tier 2 estimate only. |
| Net-pay calc requested with no RICF / dependant data | Proceed only on the **1-part** conservative default, clearly flagged. |
| Sub-SMIG salary (< 75,000 XOF, non-agricultural) | Flag as below statutory minimum; do not normalise it. |

---

## Section 9 — Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Map gross pay through statutory deductions and employer charges in this fixed order. Bookkeeping classification follows.

### 9.1 Computation order (deterministic)

1. Determine **gross taxable salary** (cash + benefits in kind), in XOF.
2. **Gross ITS** = apply §2.1 progressive scale to gross taxable salary.
3. **Net ITS** = gross ITS − §2.2 RICF reduction (floor 0).
4. **Employee CNPS** = 6.30% × min(gross, 3,375,000) + 500 XOF/person CMU.
5. **Net pay** = gross − net ITS − employee CNPS share.
6. **Employer CNPS** = 7.70% × min(gross, 3,375,000) + 5.75% × min(gross, 70,000) + AT/MP% × min(gross, 70,000) + 500 XOF/person CMU.
7. **Employer payroll tax** = 2.8% (local) or 12% (expatriate) × gross taxable remuneration.
8. **FDFP** = 1.6% × payroll (0.4% apprenticeship + 1.2% continuing training).

### 9.2 Bookkeeping classification

| Item | Account treatment |
|---|---|
| Gross salary | Expense (charges de personnel) |
| Employer CNPS, employer payroll tax, FDFP | Expense (charges sociales / charges fiscales) |
| Net ITS withheld | Liability to DGI until remitted (by the 15th) |
| Employee CNPS + CMU withheld | Liability to CNPS until remitted |
| Net pay | Liability to employee until paid; then cash out |

---

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

> All examples assume **gross = monthly taxable salary in XOF**, no benefits in kind unless stated, and an **AT/MP placeholder of 3%** (mid-band) — reviewer to substitute the employer's actual risk rate. CMU assumes **1 covered person** (500 XOF each side). All arithmetic self-checked to the franc.

### Example 1 — Single employee at the SMIG, 75,000 XOF, 1 part

- Gross ITS: income is at the 0% floor → **0**.
- RICF (1 part): 0.
- **Net ITS = 0.**
- Employee CNPS retirement: 6.30% × 75,000 = 4,725. CMU: 500. Employee deductions = **5,225**.
- **Net pay = 75,000 − 0 − 5,225 = 69,775 XOF.**
- Employer CNPS: 7.70% × 75,000 = 5,775 (retirement); family+maternity 5.75% × 70,000 (capped) = 4,025; AT/MP 3% × 70,000 = 2,100; CMU 500 → employer CNPS = **12,400**.
- Employer payroll tax (local 2.8%): 2,100. FDFP 1.6%: 1,200.
- **Total employer cost = 75,000 + 12,400 + 2,100 + 1,200 = 90,700 XOF.**

### Example 2 — Single employee, 500,000 XOF, 1 part

- Gross ITS (scale): 0 (first 75,000) + 16% × 165,000 = 26,400 + 21% × (500,000 − 240,000 = 260,000) = 54,600 → **81,000**.
- RICF (1 part): 0. **Net ITS = 81,000.**
- Employee CNPS: 6.30% × 500,000 = 31,500 + CMU 500 = **32,000**.
- **Net pay = 500,000 − 81,000 − 32,000 = 387,000 XOF.**
- Employer CNPS: 7.70% × 500,000 = 38,500 + 5.75% × 70,000 = 4,025 + 3% × 70,000 = 2,100 + CMU 500 = **45,125**.
- Employer payroll tax (2.8%): 14,000. FDFP (1.6%): 8,000.
- **Total employer cost = 500,000 + 45,125 + 14,000 + 8,000 = 567,125 XOF.**

### Example 3 — Married employee, 2 children (3 parts), 500,000 XOF

- Gross ITS (scale): **81,000** (as Example 2).
- RICF (3 parts): 22,000. **Net ITS = 81,000 − 22,000 = 59,000.**
- Employee CNPS: 31,500 + CMU (assume 1 person) 500 = **32,000**.
- **Net pay = 500,000 − 59,000 − 32,000 = 409,000 XOF.**
- Employer side identical to Example 2: employer CNPS 45,125, payroll tax 14,000, FDFP 8,000.
- **Total employer cost = 567,125 XOF** (unchanged; RICF affects only employee ITS).

### Example 4 — Senior local employee, 1,000,000 XOF, 1 part

- Gross ITS (scale): 26,400 (to 240,000) + 21% × 560,000 = 117,600 (to 800,000) → 144,000 + 24% × (1,000,000 − 800,000 = 200,000) = 48,000 → **192,000**.
- RICF (1 part): 0. **Net ITS = 192,000.**
- Employee CNPS: 6.30% × 1,000,000 = 63,000 + CMU 500 = **63,500**.
- **Net pay = 1,000,000 − 192,000 − 63,500 = 744,500 XOF.**
- Employer CNPS: 7.70% × 1,000,000 = 77,000 + 5.75% × 70,000 = 4,025 + 3% × 70,000 = 2,100 + CMU 500 = **83,625**.
- Employer payroll tax (2.8%): 28,000. FDFP (1.6%): 16,000.
- **Total employer cost = 1,000,000 + 83,625 + 28,000 + 16,000 = 1,127,625 XOF.**

### Example 5 — Expatriate executive, 4,000,000 XOF, 1 part

- Gross ITS (scale): 528,000 (to 2,400,000) + 28% × (4,000,000 − 2,400,000 = 1,600,000) = 448,000 → **976,000**.
- RICF (1 part): 0. **Net ITS = 976,000.**
- Employee CNPS retirement is capped at base 3,375,000: 6.30% × 3,375,000 = 212,625 + CMU 500 = **213,125**.
- **Net pay = 4,000,000 − 976,000 − 213,125 = 2,810,875 XOF.**
- Employer CNPS: retirement 7.70% × 3,375,000 (capped) = 259,875 + family/maternity 5.75% × 70,000 = 4,025 + AT/MP 3% × 70,000 = 2,100 + CMU 500 = **266,500**.
- Employer payroll tax (**expatriate 12%**): 12% × 4,000,000 = 480,000. FDFP (1.6%): 64,000.
- **Total employer cost = 4,000,000 + 266,500 + 480,000 + 64,000 = 4,810,500 XOF.**

### Example 6 — High earner above the top band, 10,000,000 XOF, 1 part

- Gross ITS (scale): 2,096,000 (to 8,000,000) + 32% × (10,000,000 − 8,000,000 = 2,000,000) = 640,000 → **2,736,000**.
- RICF (1 part): 0. **Net ITS = 2,736,000.**
- Employee CNPS: capped — 6.30% × 3,375,000 = 212,625 + CMU 500 = **213,125**.
- **Net pay = 10,000,000 − 2,736,000 − 213,125 = 7,050,875 XOF.**
- Employer CNPS: 7.70% × 3,375,000 = 259,875 + 5.75% × 70,000 = 4,025 + 3% × 70,000 = 2,100 + CMU 500 = **266,500**.
- Employer payroll tax (local 2.8%): 280,000. FDFP (1.6%): 160,000.
- **Total employer cost = 10,000,000 + 266,500 + 280,000 + 160,000 = 10,706,500 XOF.**

---

## Section 11 — Tier 1 Rules (always apply — no judgement)

1. **Currency is XOF/FCFA.** Refuse any other currency.
2. **Use the unified ITS scale (CGI Art. 119 bis), not the pre-2024 IGR/CN/IS stack.**
3. **Apply the progressive scale to gross taxable salary** (cash + benefits in kind), per §2.1.
4. **Subtract RICF (CGI Art. 120) after computing gross ITS**, never before; floor net ITS at 0.
5. **Employee CNPS = 6.30% retirement only** (plus flat CMU). The employee does NOT pay family allowances, maternity, AT/MP, or the employer payroll tax.
6. **Cap retirement contributions** on a monthly base of 3,375,000 XOF; **cap family/maternity/AT-MP** on 70,000 XOF.
7. **Employer payroll tax: 2.8% local / 12% expatriate** — apply 12% only with AEJ contract evidence.
8. **FDFP = 1.6%** of payroll (0.4% + 1.2%), employer-borne.
9. **ITS remitted to DGI by the 15th** of the following month; CNPS by the 15th (monthly if ≥20 staff, quarterly if <20).
10. **Never present output as final** — Tier 2 estimate pending accountant sign-off.

---

## Section 12 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items require an Ivorian expert-comptable to confirm before sign-off:

## Section 13 — Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested column layout for a monthly payroll register (one row per employee), in XOF:

| Col | Header | Formula / source |
|---|---|---|
| A | Employee name | input |
| B | Gross taxable salary | input (cash + benefits in kind) |
| C | RICF parts | input (1–5) |
| D | Gross ITS | progressive scale on B (§2.1) |
| E | RICF reduction | lookup on C (§2.2) |
| F | Net ITS | =MAX(D − E, 0) |
| G | Employee CNPS retirement | =6.30% × MIN(B, 3,375,000) |
| H | CMU (employee) | =500 × persons |
| I | Net pay | =B − F − G − H |
| J | Employer CNPS retirement | =7.70% × MIN(B, 3,375,000) |
| K | Employer family+maternity | =5.75% × MIN(B, 70,000) |
| L | Employer AT/MP | =rate% × MIN(B, 70,000) |
| M | CMU (employer) | =500 × persons |
| N | Employer payroll tax | =IF(expat, 12%, 2.8%) × B |
| O | FDFP | =1.6% × B |
| P | Total employer cost | =B + J + K + L + M + N + O |

Control totals: sum of F → DGI liability; sum of (G+H+J+K+L+M) → CNPS liability; sum of N → employer payroll-tax liability; sum of O → FDFP liability.

## Section 15 — Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data, proceed in this order:

1. **No RICF/dependant data** → compute on **1 part** (zero reduction), flag the employee can reclaim over-withheld ITS.
2. **No headcount** → assume **monthly** CNPS filing (stricter).
3. **No AT/MP notification** → accrue at **5%** (top of band), flag for correction.
4. **No contract classification** → treat as **local (2.8%)**, flag to confirm against AEJ status before any 12% application.
5. **No CMU person count** → assume **1 person** (500 XOF each side), flag.
6. **No benefit-in-kind values** → request them; do not omit from the taxable base.
7. **Any obsolete-method request** → redirect to the unified ITS (Ord. 2023-719).

Always hand off to an Ivorian expert-comptable for final sign-off.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER process payroll in any currency other than XOF/FCFA.
- NEVER use the pre-2024 IGR + CN + IS method — it was abolished by Ordonnance n° 2023-719 (effective 1 Jan 2024).
- NEVER apply the RICF reduction before computing gross ITS, and never let net ITS go below 0.
- NEVER charge the employee for family allowances, maternity, AT/MP, FDFP, or the employer payroll tax — those are employer-borne.
- NEVER apply the 12% expatriate payroll-tax rate without AEJ contract evidence.
- NEVER ignore the CNPS contribution ceilings (3,375,000 retirement; 70,000 family/maternity/AT-MP).
- NEVER omit the FDFP 1.6% levy or the flat CMU contribution.
- NEVER assume the AT/MP rate — confirm the employer's CNPS risk class (2%–5%).
- NEVER miss the 15th-of-following-month DGI/CNPS deadline.
- NEVER present any `[RESEARCH GAP]` figure as confirmed, and NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated (Tier 2) and direct to a licensed Ivorian accountant.
