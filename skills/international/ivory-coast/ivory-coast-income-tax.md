### CRITICAL — which scale is current

A 2023/2024 reform (**Ordonnance n°2023-719**, effective **1 Jan 2024**) **merged** the three former salary levies — *IS/ITS*, *Contribution Nationale (CN)*, and *Impôt Général sur le Revenu (IGR)* — into a **single monthly progressive tax on salaries ("ITS")**. Many calculator/SEO sites still publish the **pre-2024 (abolished)** barème (0/10/15/20/25/35/60% plus separate 1.5% IGR + 1.5% CN). **Do NOT use the old scale.** The scale below is confirmed against the Ordonnance legal text (loidici.biz) and PwC, which agree exactly; Deloitte confirms LF 2025 left it unchanged.

### ITS — Current Monthly Progressive Scale (per Art. 119 bis)

Applied **monthly**, per taxpayer (spouses taxed separately).

| Monthly taxable income (FCFA) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (FCFA) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 75,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 75,001 -- 240,000 | 16% | 26,400 |
| 240,001 -- 800,000 | 21% | 144,000 |
| 800,001 -- 2,400,000 | 24% | 528,000 |
| 2,400,001 -- 8,000,000 | 28% | 2,096,000 |
| Above 8,000,000 | 32% | — |

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Ivory Coast, taxes on personal income); Ordonnance n°2023-719, Art. 119 bis (loidici.biz).

**Cumulative-tax check (recomputed):**
- 75,000 → 0
- 240,000 → 0 + (240,000−75,000)×16% = 165,000×0.16 = **26,400** ✓
- 800,000 → 26,400 + (800,000−240,000)×21% = 560,000×0.21 = 117,600 → **144,000** ✓
- 2,400,000 → 144,000 + (2,400,000−800,000)×24% = 1,600,000×0.24 = 384,000 → **528,000** ✓
- 8,000,000 → 528,000 + (8,000,000−2,400,000)×28% = 5,600,000×0.28 = 1,568,000 → **2,096,000** ✓

### RICF — Family-Responsibility Reduction (replaces old quotient familial)

A flat **monthly reduction** of the computed gross ITS, by number of "parts" (shares), capped at 5 parts.

| Parts | Monthly reduction (FCFA) |
|---|---|
| 1.0 | 0 |
| 2.0 | 11,000 |
| 3.0 | 22,000 |
| 4.0 | 33,000 |
| 5.0 (max) | 44,000 |

Source: PwC (deductions); loidici.biz (reform note).

**Shares (parts) allocation:**

| Situation | Parts |
|---|---|
| Single / divorced / widowed, no children | 1.0 |
| Married, no children | 2.0 |
| Single / divorced, 1 child | 2.0 |
| Married / widowed, 1 child | 2.5 |
| Each additional dependent child | +0.5 |
| Minor/infirm adult dependent | +1.0 |
| **Maximum** | **5.0** |

Source: PwC (deductions); loidici.biz. **Over-70 retirees:** 75% reduction of the tax computed *after* the RICF; exempt pension portion raised from 200,000 to **320,000 FCFA** (loidici.biz; PwC).

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown number of parts / family situation | Use **1.0 part** (zero RICF reduction) — never inflate parts without proof |
| Unknown resident vs non-resident | STOP — do not compute (see Refusal R-CI-3) |
| Unknown local vs expatriate (employer payroll tax) | Treat as **local** (2.8%) and flag for reviewer |
| Unknown business regime | Classify by turnover; if turnover unknown, STOP |
| Unknown whether allowance is taxable | Treat as **taxable** (reform removed most abatements) |
| Unknown benefit-in-kind value | Flag for reviewer (use DGI scheduled deemed values) |
| Unknown CNPS ceiling applicability | Apply the relevant ceiling; never exceed it |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable (employee)** — full-year payslips (bulletins de paie) or a bank statement showing net salary, plus family situation (parts) and local/expat status.

**Minimum viable (self-employed/business)** — bank statement for the full tax year (CSV/PDF/text) **and** annual turnover (chiffre d'affaires TTC), which determines the regime.

**Recommended** — employer's monthly ITS returns (état 301 / déclaration), CNPS statements, invoices, prior-year DGI assessment, CGA membership status (halves several rates).

**Ideal** — complete income/expenditure account, asset register, benefit-in-kind schedule (housing/water/electricity/A-C), withholding certificates (BNC).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement or payslips at all = hard stop. Bank statement only, no invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "Produced from bank statement alone — reviewer must verify all deductions are supported and the wholly-and-exclusively / professional-purpose test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-CI-1 — Family situation (parts) unknown.** "The RICF reduction depends on the number of parts. Compute provisionally at 1.0 part (no reduction) and flag, or obtain the family situation before finalising."

**R-CI-2 — Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals (employees, sole proprietors, liberal professions). Sociétés (SA, SARL, SAS) file corporate IS returns. Escalate to an expert-comptable."

**R-CI-3 — Non-resident / expatriate complex cases.** "Non-resident taxation, treaty relief, and split-year residence have distinct rules. Out of scope. Escalate."

**R-CI-4 — Capital gains on property/shares.** "Building-sale gains (17%) and certain share-sale gains need specialised analysis. Escalate."

**R-CI-5 — Arrears / DGI enforcement (mise en demeure, taxation d'office).** "Penalties escalate to a 100% surcharge plus interest. Do not advise — escalate to an expert-comptable immediately."

**R-CI-6 — VAT (TVA) return requested.** "This skill covers income tax only. TVA standard rate is 18% (PwC) — use a dedicated VAT skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in **FCFA (XOF)**. ITS scale and RICF per Section 1.

### Example 1 -- Mid-range salaried employee, single (1 part)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; SGBCI VIREMENT ; EMPLOYEUR SARL TECHCI ; SALAIRE AVRIL ; +280 825 ; XOF`

**Reasoning.** Monthly taxable salary **350,000** (gross taxable; the credit shown is net after PAYE+CNPS — reconcile to gross of 350,000).
- ITS gross = 26,400 + (350,000 − 240,000) × 21% = 26,400 + 110,000 × 0.21 = 26,400 + 23,100 = **49,500**
- RICF, 1 part = **0** → net ITS = **49,500**
- CNPS pension employee 6.3% × 350,000 = **22,050** (below 3,375,000 ceiling)
- Net pay = 350,000 − 49,500 − 22,050 = **278,450**

**Classification:** ITS withheld 49,500; CNPS employee 22,050; net pay 278,450.

> (The bank credit 280,825 differs from 278,450 only if employer also reimburses a non-taxable allowance — flag if material.)

### Example 2 -- Same salary, married with 2 children (3.0 parts)

**Input:** Monthly taxable salary **350,000**; married, 2 dependent children → parts = 2.0 (married, 1 child = 2.5) + 0.5 (2nd child) = **3.0 parts**.
- ITS gross = **49,500** (as Example 1)
- RICF, 3 parts = **22,000** → net ITS = 49,500 − 22,000 = **27,500**
- CNPS employee 6.3% × 350,000 = **22,050**
- Net pay = 350,000 − 27,500 − 22,050 = **300,450**

**Classification:** ITS 27,500; CNPS 22,050; net pay 300,450.

### Example 3 -- Higher earner, married no children (2.0 parts)

**Input:** Monthly taxable salary **1,000,000**; married, no children → **2.0 parts**.
- ITS gross = 144,000 + (1,000,000 − 800,000) × 24% = 144,000 + 200,000 × 0.24 = 144,000 + 48,000 = **192,000**
- RICF, 2 parts = **11,000** → net ITS = **181,000**
- CNPS pension employee 6.3% × 1,000,000 = **63,000** (below 3,375,000 ceiling)
- Net pay = 1,000,000 − 181,000 − 63,000 = **756,000**

**Classification:** ITS 181,000; CNPS 63,000; net pay 756,000.

### Example 4 -- Employer payroll tax (taxe sur salaires), expatriate

**Input:** Employer employs one expatriate on monthly taxable remuneration **1,000,000**.
- Expatriate employer payroll tax = 12% × 1,000,000 = **120,000** (PwC; former 20% abatement removed)
- (Local employee equivalent would be 2.8% × 1,000,000 = **28,000**)

**Classification:** Employer-borne taxe sur salaires = 120,000 (expat) — this is an employer cost, NOT withheld from the employee.

### Example 5 -- Self-employed consultant, BNC, resident withholding

**Input line:**
`15/06/2025 ; ECOBANK VIREMENT ; CLIENT BTP CI ; HONORAIRES FACTURE 2025-014 ; +925 000 ; XOF`

**Reasoning.** Registered resident liberal professional (BNC). The payer withholds **7.5%** WHT at source on the gross fee (PwC / arcop.ci). If the gross invoice was 1,000,000, then WHT = 75,000 and the net received = 925,000. The BNC profit is taxed under the réel regime at the BIC/standard rate of **25%** on net profit; the 7.5% is a creditable advance, not final, for residents.

**Classification:** Gross fee 1,000,000; WHT credit 75,000; net received 925,000. Annual BNC profit taxed at 25% with WHT credited.

### Example 6 -- Régime de l'entreprenant, Taxe d'État (TEE)

**Input:** Service provider, annual turnover **30,000,000 FCFA TTC**, NOT a CGA member.
- Falls in entreprenant TEE band (5,000,001–50,000,000). Services rate = **5%** (commerce/retail would be 4%).
- Annual TEE = 5% × 30,000,000 = **1,500,000**
- Paid monthly at 1/12 = **125,000/month**, due by the **10th** (blog.ivoire-juriste.com; ccesp.ci)
- If a CGA member: rate halved (50%) → 2.5% → annual **750,000** (125,000... i.e. 62,500/month)

**Classification:** TEE 1,500,000/year (125,000/month); 750,000/year if CGA member.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 ITS taxable base

Includes **all cash remuneration** — base salary, living/housing allowances, bonuses, and employer-paid social contributions. The 2024 reform **eliminated the former 20% abatement / standard employment-expense deduction** (PwC, deductions & other taxes). Benefits in kind (housing, electricity, water, A/C) are taxed at DGI deemed scheduled values (PwC, income determination).

**Some non-taxable thresholds** (PwC, income determination):
| Item | Exempt up to |
|---|---|
| Food allowance | 30,000 FCFA/month |
| Business-expense allowance | 10% of taxable cash income |
| Non-mandatory social contributions | ≤10% of gross income and ≤3,800,000 FCFA/year |

### 5.2 ITS computation order

1. Determine **monthly taxable income** (Section 5.1).
2. Apply the **progressive scale** (Section 1) → gross ITS.
3. Subtract the **RICF** reduction for the number of parts (max 5).
4. If retiree over 70: apply the further **75%** reduction (Section 1).
5. Result = monthly ITS withheld by employer (PAYE).

### 5.3 Employer payroll tax (taxe sur salaires, employer-borne)

| Workforce | Rate on total taxable remuneration |
|---|---|
| Local employees | **2.8%** |
| Expatriate employees | **12%** |

Source: PwC (corporate & individual, other taxes). Former 20% reduction eliminated. This is an **employer** cost — not withheld from the employee.

### 5.4 CNPS social security

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Combined | Monthly ceiling (FCFA) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Retirement / pension | 6.3% | 7.7% | **14.0%** | 3,375,000 |
| Family allowances (incl. maternity) | — | 5.75% | 5.75% | 70,000 |
| Work-injury (accidents du travail) | — | 2% to 5% (by risk) | 2%–5% | 70,000 |

Source: PwC (individual & corporate, other taxes).
**Arithmetic check:** pension employee 6.3% + employer 7.7% = **14.0%** combined ✓. Note the two ceilings: pension capped at **3,375,000/month**; family-allowance and work-injury capped at **70,000/month**.

### 5.5 Minimum wage (SMIG)

- **SMIG = 75,000 FCFA/month** (Décret n°2022-986, in force since 1 Jan 2023; no revaluation as of 2026) (guidedufonctionnaire.com; sikafinance.com).
- Agricultural minimum **SMAG = 39,960 FCFA/month** (same sources).
- **SMIG equals the 0% ITS band ceiling**, so minimum-wage earners pay **no ITS**.

### 5.6 Business income regimes (by annual turnover, CA TTC)

| Regime | Turnover band (FCFA TTC) | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| **Entreprenant — TCE (Taxe Communale)** | < 5,000,000 | <1.2M: fixed daily forfait set by the local authority. 1.2M–5M: **2.5%** (commerce/retail) or **2%** (services/crafts) |
| **Entreprenant — TEE (Taxe d'État)** | 5,000,001 – 50,000,000 | **4%** (commerce/retail), **5%** (services); halved (50%) for CGA members. Paid monthly (1/12), due 10th |
| **Microentreprises** | 50,000,001 – 200,000,000 | **7%** of CA TTC; **5%** for CGA members |
| **Réel Simplifié (RSI)** | option from ~100M; standard ≥200M up to 500M `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact RSI/RNI boundary in CGI]` | BIC/BNC at standard rate |
| **Réel Normal (RNI)** | > 500,000,000 | BIC/BNC at standard rate |

Sources: blog.ivoire-juriste.com; ccesp.ci; ivoire-juriste.com. The entreprenant ≤50M and microentreprise 50,000,001–200,000,000 bands are consistently reported; RSI/RNI exact boundaries vary between secondary sources — **flagged as a research gap**.

### 5.7 Profit-tax rates (réel regimes) and minimum tax

| Item | Rate |
|---|---|
| BIC / standard profit tax (general) | **25%** |
| Telecom / IT / communications | **30%** |
| BNC (liberal professions) | taxed at the BIC rate (**25%**) under the réel regimes |
| Minimum tax (IMF) | **0.5% of turnover**, floor **3,000,000**, cap **35,000,000** FCFA |

Source: PwC (taxes on corporate income).

### 5.8 Withholding on BNC service payments

| Payee | WHT rate | Final? |
|---|---|---|
| Registered resident | **7.5%** of gross | Creditable advance (not final) |
| Non-resident / no professional establishment in CI | **20%** of gross | **Final (libératoire)** |

Source: arcop.ci; fideca.com.

### 5.9 Other individual taxes

| Tax | Rate |
|---|---|
| VAT (TVA), standard | **18%** (PwC, other taxes) |
| Capital gains — buildings sold by individuals | **17%** (PwC, other taxes) |
| Capital gains — generally (other) | Generally not taxable for individuals; certain share gains taxable (PwC) |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Number of parts (RICF)
- Confirm marital status, number and ages of dependent children, and any infirm/adult dependents.
- **Conservative default:** 1.0 part (no reduction) until family situation documented.
- Flag: max 5.0 parts; over-70 retiree 75% second reduction.

### 6.2 Benefits in kind
- Housing, electricity, water, A/C valued at DGI scheduled deemed amounts, added to the ITS base.
- **Conservative default:** flag for reviewer to apply the correct deemed value. `[RESEARCH GAP — DGI deemed BIK scale values not reproduced here; reviewer to source.]`

### 6.3 Local vs expatriate (employer payroll tax)
- 2.8% (local) vs 12% (expat) materially changes employer cost.
- **Conservative default:** local (2.8%) and flag.

### 6.4 Business regime classification
- Driven by turnover TTC and CGA membership. CGA membership halves entreprenant TEE and microentreprise rates.
- Flag if turnover is near a band boundary or CGA status is unconfirmed.

### 6.5 Home-office / mixed-use utilities (réel regimes)
- CIE (electricity), SODECI (water), telecoms apportioned to business-use %.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until a documented, reasonable basis is provided.

### 6.6 Vehicle business use
- Fuel/insurance/maintenance apportioned to business %; requires a log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until log provided.

### 6.7 BNC withholding credit vs final tax
- 7.5% resident WHT is creditable; 20% non-resident WHT is final. Confirm payee status.

### Filing, payment, administration

- **Tax year = calendar year.** Salary tax is **withheld monthly by the employer (PAYE)**; the employer files monthly returns for both employee and employer payroll taxes. Employees with a local employer generally do not file a separate return; **spouses are taxed and file separately** (PwC, tax administration).
- **Monthly payment due dates (for the preceding month):** industrial/mining/oil — **10th**; sales companies — **15th**; service providers — **20th**; other registered entities — **15th**; entreprenant & micro-enterprise — **10th** (PwC, tax administration).
- **Annual business-profit deadlines:** companies subject to statutory audit — **30 June**; other companies — **30 May** (PwC).

### Penalties (DGI / CGI / Livre des Procédures Fiscales)

| Situation | Charge |
|---|---|
| Late filing before formal notice (mise en demeure) | **5%** of duties declared |
| Filed within 7 days after mise en demeure | **10%** of duties |
| No filing after mise en demeure | Taxation d'office **+ 100%** surcharge |
| Late payment | **10%** flat from day 1, **plus monthly interest** `[RESEARCH GAP — exact monthly interest % not confirmed against primary CGI; reviewer to confirm]` |

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Single employee, 1 part.**
Input: monthly taxable salary 350,000; single (1 part).
Expected: ITS gross = 49,500; RICF = 0; ITS = **49,500**; CNPS employee = 22,050; net pay = **278,450**.

**Test 2 — Married, 2 children (3 parts).**
Input: monthly taxable salary 350,000; 3 parts.
Expected: ITS gross 49,500; RICF 22,000; ITS = **27,500**; CNPS 22,050; net pay = **300,450**.

**Test 3 — Higher earner, married no children (2 parts).**
Input: monthly taxable salary 1,000,000; 2 parts.
Expected: ITS gross = 192,000; RICF 11,000; ITS = **181,000**; CNPS 63,000; net pay = **756,000**.

**Test 4 — Minimum-wage earner.**
Input: monthly salary 75,000 (SMIG); any parts.
Expected: falls in 0% band → ITS = **0**. CNPS employee 6.3% × 75,000 = 4,725.

**Test 5 — Expatriate employer payroll tax.**
Input: expat, monthly taxable remuneration 1,000,000.
Expected: employer taxe sur salaires = 12% × 1,000,000 = **120,000** (vs 28,000 if local).

**Test 6 — BNC resident withholding.**
Input: registered resident, gross fee 1,000,000.
Expected: WHT = 7.5% × 1,000,000 = **75,000** (creditable advance); net received 925,000; annual profit taxed at 25% with WHT credited.

**Test 7 — Entreprenant TEE, services, non-CGA.**
Input: services, turnover 30,000,000 TTC, not CGA.
Expected: TEE = 5% × 30,000,000 = **1,500,000/year** (125,000/month); 750,000/year if CGA.

**Test 8 — Pre-2024 scale rejection.**
Input: a worksheet applying 0/10/15/20/25/35/60% + 1.5% IGR + 1.5% CN.
Expected: **REJECT** — that is the abolished pre-2024 system. Recompute with the Art. 119 bis monthly scale.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER use the **pre-2024 (abolished)** salary barème (0/10/15/20/25/35/60% + IGR + CN). Use the Art. 119 bis monthly scale only.
- NEVER inflate the number of **parts** for RICF without documented proof — default to 1.0.
- NEVER exceed the RICF cap of **5.0 parts** or the monthly reduction of **44,000**.
- NEVER ignore the **CNPS ceilings** (3,375,000 pension; 70,000 family/work-injury).
- NEVER apply the **20% expatriate** employer payroll tax to a local employee, or vice versa, without confirmation.
- NEVER apply the old **20% employment-expense abatement** — the 2024 reform removed it.
- NEVER treat ITS or TVA payments as deductible business expenses.
- NEVER treat the **7.5% resident BNC WHT** as final — it is a creditable advance (only the 20% non-resident WHT is final).
- NEVER classify a business regime without the **annual turnover (CA TTC)**.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated, pending professional sign-off.
