### Contribution rates (employment)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Total | Base ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AFP — pension | 2.87% | 7.10% | 9.97% | 20× the minimum cotizable wage |
| SFS — health (family) | 3.04% | 7.09% | 10.13% | 10× the minimum cotizable wage |
| SRL — occupational risk | 0.00% | ~1.20% (1.0% fixed + variable by risk class) | ~1.20% | 4× the minimum cotizable wage; employer-only |
| INFOTEP — training | 0.50% of bonuses only | 1.00% of monthly payroll | — | no SDSS ceiling |
| **Employee payroll total** | **5.91%** (AFP 2.87 + SFS 3.04) | — | | |
| **Employer payroll total** | — | **~16.39%** (7.10 + 7.09 + ~1.20 + 1.00) | | |

*Sources: TSS; PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Dominican Republic, Other taxes.*

> **SRL is approximate.** ~1.0% fixed for all employers plus a variable surcharge by risk classification (Type I–IV). Confirm the company's assigned SRL rate from its TSS classification rather than assuming 1.20%. [TSS; Contadom]
>
> **INFOTEP employee 0.5% applies only to bonuses/gratification (regalía), not to ordinary salary.**

### Contributory-wage floor and ceilings

The base is the salario cotizable, between **1× the minimum cotizable wage** (floor) and the per-fund ceiling. The minimum cotizable wage is set by TSS resolution:

| Period | Min cotizable wage | AFP ceiling (20×) | SFS ceiling (10×) | SRL ceiling (4×) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Apr 2025 – 31 Jan 2026 | RD$21,674.80/mo | RD$433,496/mo | RD$216,748/mo | RD$86,699.20/mo |
| from 1 Feb 2026 | RD$23,223/mo | RD$464,460/mo | RD$232,230/mo | RD$92,892/mo |

*(TSS Res. 01-2025.) Use the ceiling matching the contribution month. Salary above a fund's ceiling does not increase that fund's contribution.*

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown SRL risk class | Use 1.20% and flag for reviewer to confirm the TSS-assigned rate |
| Unknown contribution month (which ceiling) | Use the ceiling for the period the salary was paid |
| Self-employed vs employee unclear | STOP — the regimes differ; confirm before computing |
| Salary below 1× min cotizable | Apply the 1× floor as the base |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs & Refusal Catalogue

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly salary (or self-employed contributory income) and the contribution month (to pick the ceiling). Without a salary figure, STOP.

**Recommended** — the employer's SRL risk classification, and whether the worker is salaried (employee) or self-employed/independent.

**R-DO-SSC-1 — Self-employed/voluntary affiliation.** Self-employed affiliation rules and rates differ from the salaried split above; do not apply the 2.87% / 7.10% employee/employer split to a self-employed person. Escalate to a reviewer.

**R-DO-SSC-2 — SRL arrears or reclassification.** Do not quantify SRL arrears or risk-class disputes without the TSS classification letter.

## Section 3 -- Payment Pattern Library (bank statement / accounting)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TSS, TESORERIA SEGURIDAD SOCIAL | EXCLUDE — SDSS remittance | Combined AFP+SFS+SRL+INFOTEP payment |
| AFP, FONDO PENSIONES, SIPEN | EXCLUDE — pension | Part of the TSS remittance |
| SFS, ARS, SEGURO FAMILIAR SALUD | EXCLUDE — health | Part of the TSS remittance |
| INFOTEP | EXCLUDE — training levy | Employer 1% of payroll |
| DGII, ISR, RETENCIÓN | EXCLUDE — income tax, not SDSS | Different obligation |

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Mid salary (gross RD$50,000/month, Apr-2025 ceilings)

- AFP employee 2.87% × 50,000 = **RD$1,435.00**; SFS employee 3.04% × 50,000 = **RD$1,520.00** → employee TSS = **RD$2,955.00**
- Employer: AFP 7.10% = 3,550.00; SFS 7.09% = 3,545.00; SRL 1.20% = 600.00; INFOTEP 1% = 500.00 → **RD$8,195.00**
- All below the per-fund ceilings (50,000 < 216,748 SFS ceiling).

### Example 2 — High salary above the SFS ceiling (gross RD$300,000/month)

- SFS base capped at RD$216,748 → SFS employee 3.04% × 216,748 = **RD$6,589.14** (NOT 3.04% × 300,000)
- AFP base 300,000 < 433,496 ceiling → AFP employee 2.87% × 300,000 = **RD$8,610.00**
- Apply each fund's own ceiling independently.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules

1. **[T1]** Employee TSS = AFP 2.87% + SFS 3.04% = **5.91%** of salario cotizable, each capped at its own ceiling (AFP 20×, SFS 10×). [TSS; PwC]
2. **[T1]** Employer TSS = AFP 7.10% + SFS 7.09% + SRL ~1.20% + INFOTEP 1% ≈ **16.39%**. [TSS; PwC]
3. **[T1]** Each fund uses its OWN ceiling — cap AFP at 20×, SFS at 10×, SRL at 4× the minimum cotizable wage; do not apply one ceiling to all funds.
4. **[T1]** INFOTEP employee 0.5% applies only to bonuses/gratification, never to ordinary salary.
5. **[T1]** Contributions are remitted monthly via the TSS platform; the same remittance covers all four funds.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement)

- **T2-1 SRL risk class.** The variable SRL surcharge depends on the company's Type I–IV classification; confirm the assigned rate.
- **T2-2 Self-employed affiliation.** Different rate structure — confirm before computing.
- **T2-3 Multiple employers.** Contribution-base aggregation across employers needs reviewer handling.

---

## Section 7 -- Interaction with Income Tax

Employee AFP + SFS contributions (5.91%) are **deducted from salary before the ISR retención is computed** — see `dominican-republic-payroll.md` and `dominican-republic-income-tax.md`. The ISR annual exempt threshold is RD$416,220 (FY2025).

---

## Section 8 -- Test Suite

**Test 1:** Gross RD$50,000 (Apr-2025). → employee TSS 2,955.00; employer TSS 8,195.00.
**Test 2:** Gross RD$300,000. → SFS employee capped at 216,748 → 6,589.14; AFP employee 8,610.00 (uncapped at this level).
**Test 3:** Gross RD$21,674.80 (= 1× floor, Apr-2025). → employee TSS 5.91% × 21,674.80 = RD$1,281.00.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply one ceiling to all funds — AFP (20×), SFS (10×), and SRL (4×) each have their own.
- NEVER charge employees SRL — it is employer-only.
- NEVER apply INFOTEP 0.5% to ordinary salary — it is on bonuses only.
- NEVER use the wrong period's minimum cotizable wage — the ceilings changed on 1 Feb 2026.
- NEVER present SDSS figures as definitive — label as estimated and direct to a licensed Dominican contador.
