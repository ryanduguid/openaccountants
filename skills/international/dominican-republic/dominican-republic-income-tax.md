### ISR Rate Brackets (FY2025) -- Individuals (personas físicas)

The same progressive scale applies to salaried employees (withheld monthly) and to self-employed / independent professionals (assessed annually on IR-1). Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (updated 05 Dec 2025); DGII escala salarial FY2025.

| Annual Taxable Income (RD$) | Tax on Lower Limit | Rate on Excess | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 416,220.00 | 0 | 0% (exempt) | RD$0 |
| 416,220.01 -- 624,329.00 | 0 | 15% of excess over 416,220.01 | RD$31,216 |
| 624,329.01 -- 867,123.00 | RD$31,216 | 20% of excess over 624,329.01 | RD$79,775 |
| 867,123.01 and above | RD$79,776 | 25% of excess over 867,123.01 | -- (top marginal rate 25%) |

**Arithmetic check of band bases:**
- Top of 15% band: (624,329.00 − 416,220.01) × 15% = 208,108.99 × 0.15 = RD$31,216.35 ≈ **RD$31,216** ✓
- Top of 20% band: 31,216 + (867,123.00 − 624,329.01) × 20% = 31,216 + 242,793.99 × 0.20 = 31,216 + 48,558.80 = **RD$79,774.80 ≈ RD$79,775** (DGII publishes the next-band base as RD$79,776 owing to rounding) ✓

**Notes:**
- The annual exempt threshold of **RD$416,220 (FY2025)** is inflation-indexed each year (up ~4.2% from FY2024's RD$399,923) [PwC; DGII Comunidad de Ayuda CA687].
- The monthly salary level at which withholding begins is **~RD$34,685/month** (416,220 ÷ 12) [P&H Law; DGII].
- The top marginal rate is **25%** [PwC; DGII].
- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** The FY2026 scale had not been separately confirmed as published by DGII at research time. Use the FY2025 scale for income earned in calendar 2025 and re-pull the DGII escala salarial for any later filing year.

### Social-Security (SDSS) Contribution Rates -- Monthly Salary

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries; TSS / SDSS (Ley 87-01); INFOTEP (Ley 116-80). Rates apply to dependent (salaried) workers. Self-employed are **not** mandatorily covered (see Conservative Defaults).

| Component | Employee | Employer | Total | Statutory base / ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AFP -- Seguro de Vejez, Discapacidad y Sobrevivencia (pension) | 2.87% | 7.10% | 9.97% | Floor 1× / ceiling 20× minimum cotizable wage [TSS] |
| SFS -- Seguro Familiar de Salud (health) | 3.04% | 7.09% | 10.13% | Floor 1× / ceiling 10× minimum cotizable wage [TSS] |
| SRL -- Seguro de Riesgos Laborales (occupational risk) | 0.00% | ~1.20% | ~1.20% | Ceiling 4× minimum cotizable wage; employer-only [TSS] |
| **SDSS subtotal** | **5.91%** | **15.39%** | **21.30%** | -- |
| INFOTEP (vocational training levy) | 0.5% on year-end bonus only | 1.00% of payroll | -- | Separate from SDSS; collected via TSS [INFOTEP, Ley 116-80] |

**Arithmetic check of the SDSS subtotal:**
- Employee: 2.87 + 3.04 + 0.00 = **5.91%** ✓
- Employer: 7.10 + 7.09 + 1.20 = **15.39%** ✓
- Total: 9.97 + 10.13 + 1.20 = **21.30%** (= 5.91 + 15.39) ✓
- Employer cost incl. INFOTEP: 15.39 + 1.00 = **~16.39% of payroll** [PwC; RemotePeople; Contadom]

**Notes / caveats:**
- **SRL rate ~1.20% is approximate.** It is a fixed component (~1.0% for all employers) plus a variable surcharge based on the company's risk classification (Type I–IV); sources differ on the maximum variable (cited as up to 0.3%, occasionally up to 0.6%). **Confirm the specific company's assigned SRL rate from its TSS classification** rather than assuming a flat 1.20% [TSS; Contadom].
- **AFP 7.10% employer / 2.87% employee** per PwC; some payroll guides itemize small allocations to solidarity/disability/operating funds differently (e.g. splitting out a 0.4% solidarity fund). Reconcile against current TSS technical instructions if exact sub-allocations are needed [PwC; caveat].
- INFOTEP's 0.5% employee charge is withheld from the **Christmas bonus (regalía pascual)**, not from regular salary [INFOTEP].

### SDSS Contribution Ceilings (multiplier of the minimum cotizable wage)

| Period | Minimum cotizable wage | AFP ceiling (20×) | SFS ceiling (10×) | SRL ceiling (4×) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| From 1 Feb 2026 | RD$23,223/mo [TSS] | RD$464,460/mo | RD$232,230/mo | RD$92,892/mo |
| 1 Apr 2025 -- 31 Jan 2026 | RD$21,674.80/mo [TSS Res. 01-2025] | RD$433,496/mo | RD$216,748/mo | RD$86,699.20/mo |

**Arithmetic check (1 Feb 2026 base RD$23,223):** 23,223 × 20 = 464,460 ✓; × 10 = 232,230 ✓; × 4 = 92,892 ✓. (1 Apr 2025 base RD$21,674.80): × 20 = 433,496 ✓; × 10 = 216,748 ✓; × 4 = 86,699.20 ✓. Each ceiling ≥ the 1× floor. **Use the ceiling matching the contribution month** [TSS; conservative default].

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Direct fetches of tss.gob.do and the official Resolution 01-2025 PDF returned 403/timeout at research time. Ceiling figures were corroborated via Acento and P&H Law citing the official TSS announcement plus PwC. A reviewer should confirm the exact DOP ceilings and effective dates against the primary TSS resolution.

### Withholding on Payments to Individuals (retención de ISR)

Source: P&H Law; Decreto 139-98.

| Payment type | Withholding rate | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Professional services / honorarios (legal, accounting, engineering, consultancy) | 10% ISR | Decreto 139-98 |
| Technical services (masonry, plumbing, carpentry, etc.) | 2% ISR | Decreto 139-98 |
| Rentals paid to individuals | 10% ISR | Decreto 139-98 |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residence / source of income | Treat as DR tax resident taxed on DR-source income (territorial) [PwC] |
| Unknown whether freelancer is SDSS-affiliated | Do NOT auto-apply employee SDSS deductions to a pure self-employed person (voluntary only) [TSS] |
| Unknown contribution month for SDSS ceilings | Use the ceiling set matching the contribution month (Feb-2026 set for current periods) [TSS] |
| Unknown tax year for ISR scale | Apply the FY2025 scale (exempt RD$416,220) for income earned in calendar 2025 [DGII] |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown ITBIS registration | Assume registered if taxable supplies are made; charge 18% [DGII] |
| Unknown RNC status | Self-employed carrying on business/professional activity must register (free) [DGII] |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) residence status, (b) whether the person is salaried, self-employed, or both, and (c) RNC registration status.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices (comprobantes fiscales / NCF), purchase invoices/receipts, evidence of ISR withheld by payers (certificaciones de retención), TSS contribution records (if affiliated), prior-year IR-1 or assessment, ITBIS registration status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register with depreciation schedule, monthly IR-3/IR-17/IT-1 filings, withholding certificates, and regalía pascual records.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This IR-1 was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid fiscal receipts (NCF) and that the income is wholly DR-source business/professional income."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-DO-1 -- Residence / source uncertain.** "Dominican Republic uses a territorial system, and the taxation of foreign-source income depends on residence facts and the 3-year rule for newly-resident individuals. This skill cannot determine residence. Please confirm before proceeding, or escalate to a Dominican CPA." [PwC]

**R-DO-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and sole proprietors (personas físicas) only. Sociedades and other personas jurídicas file the IR-2 corporate return under different rules. Escalate to a Dominican CPA."

**R-DO-3 -- Foreign-source income / expatriates.** "Foreign-source investment income of a newly-resident individual is generally only taxed from the 3rd year of residence, and treaty relief may apply. Out of scope. Escalate to a Dominican CPA." [PwC]

**R-DO-4 -- Capital gains / asset disposals.** "Capital gains computations require specialised analysis under the Código Tributario. Escalate to a Dominican CPA."

**R-DO-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding ISR or SDSS arrears or is subject to DGII/TSS enforcement. Surcharges of 10% (first month) + 4%/month plus 1.10%/month interest compound quickly. Do not advise. Escalate to a Dominican CPA immediately." [DGII]

**R-DO-6 -- ITBIS (VAT) return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (ISR / IR-1) only. For Dominican ITBIS, use the dominican-republic-itbis skill (Form IT-1)."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (ITBIS-registered, 10% withheld at source)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; BANRESERVAS TRANSFERENCIA RECIBIDA ; CONSTRUCTORA DEL CARIBE SRL ; PAGO FACT B0100000045 ; +106,200.00 ; DOP`

**Reasoning:**
Client payment for professional services. Provider is ITBIS-registered, so the gross billed was net + 18% ITBIS. If the RD$106,200 received already reflects the invoice net of any ISR withholding, confirm the certificación de retención. Assume the bank credit is the cash received and the underlying invoice net of ITBIS is the business income line.
- If RD$106,200 is **inclusive** of 18% ITBIS: net business income = 106,200 ÷ 1.18 = RD$90,000; ITBIS collected = RD$16,200 (a liability to DGII, excluded from income).

**Classification:** Business income = RD$90,000 (net of ITBIS). ITBIS RD$16,200 excluded. Note any 10% ISR withheld by the payer as a credit against the annual ISR.

### Example 2 -- SaaS Subscription (Fully Deductible)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2025 ; POPULAR DÉBITO AUTOMÁTICO ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD ABR ; -1,770.00 ; DOP`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, business use. Fully deductible operating expense. ITBIS on imported digital services may apply separately; for income tax the business cost is the net charge.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense = RD$1,770 (or net of recoverable ITBIS if registered and reclaimable).

### Example 3 -- Honorarios Paid to an Individual (Withholding obligation)

**Input line:**
`22/04/2025 ; BHD TRANSFERENCIA ; JUAN PÉREZ (abogado) ; HONORARIOS ASESORÍA ; -50,000.00 ; DOP`

**Reasoning:**
Payment for professional services to an individual. Deductible expense, but the payer has an obligation to **withhold 10% ISR** (RD$5,000) and remit it on Form IR-17 by the 10th of the following month [Decreto 139-98]. If the RD$50,000 is the net paid after withholding, gross fee = RD$55,555.56 and RD$5,555.56 withheld; if RD$50,000 is the gross fee, RD$5,000 should have been withheld and RD$45,000 paid. Confirm the contract basis.

**Classification:** Deductible expense (gross fee). Flag the 10% IR-17 withholding obligation for the reviewer.

### Example 4 -- Salary Received (Already Withheld -- not self-employment)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; POPULAR ABONO ; NÓMINA EMPRESA XYZ SRL ; SUELDO ABRIL ; +60,000.00 ; DOP`

**Reasoning:**
Employment income. The employer withholds ISR monthly via the annualized scale and reports on Form IR-3. No tax is due until annualized salary exceeds RD$416,220 (~RD$34,685/month) [P&H Law; DGII]. A purely salaried person whose wages are fully withheld generally need not file IR-1. This is NOT self-employment income.

**Classification:** Employment income (separate stream). Exclude from self-employed business income; confirm withholding via the employee's payslip.

### Example 5 -- ISR Computation for a Self-Employed Professional

**Inputs:** Self-employed consultant, DR-resident, RNC-registered. Gross professional income RD$1,200,000; deductible business expenses RD$300,000; not SDSS-affiliated.

**Reasoning:**
- Net taxable income = 1,200,000 − 300,000 = **RD$900,000**.
- RD$900,000 falls in the top band (over RD$867,123).
- ISR = base RD$79,776 + 25% × (900,000 − 867,123.01) = 79,776 + 25% × 32,876.99 = 79,776 + 8,219.25 = **RD$87,995.25**.
- If RD$30,000 of ISR was withheld at source (certificaciones de retención), ISR due on IR-1 = 87,995.25 − 30,000 = **RD$57,995.25**.

**Classification:** IR-1 net taxable income RD$900,000; ISR before credits RD$87,995.25; ISR due after withholding credit RD$57,995.25.

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BHD TRANSFERENCIA ; CUENTA PROPIA - AHORROS ; ; -100,000.00 ; DOP`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the client's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Territorial System and Residence

**Legislation:** Código Tributario (Ley 11-92); PwC.

The Dominican Republic uses a **territorial** system: residents are taxed on DR-source income. Foreign-source investment/financial income of a newly-resident individual is taxed only **from the 3rd year of residence**. Default to DR-source income unless residence facts indicate otherwise [PwC].

### 5.2 The Progressive ISR Scale (FY2025)

Apply the Section 1 scale: 0% up to RD$416,220; 15% on 416,220–624,329; base RD$31,216 + 20% on 624,329–867,123; base RD$79,776 + 25% above 867,123. Top marginal rate 25%. The exempt threshold is inflation-indexed annually [PwC; DGII].

### 5.3 Tax Year and Filing

Tax year is the calendar year ending 31 December. Individuals / sole proprietors file **Form IR-1** by **31 March** of the following year. Salaried employees with only fully-withheld wages generally need not file [DGII].

### 5.4 Employee Withholding (PAYE-style)

Employers withhold ISR monthly using the annualized scale (no tax until salary exceeds ~RD$34,685/month) and report on **Form IR-3 by the 10th** of the following month, even if nil [P&H Law; DGII].

### 5.5 Deductibility of Business Expenses

Expenses incurred to obtain, maintain, or conserve taxable income are deductible if supported by a valid fiscal receipt (NCF). Personal, entertainment, fines, drawings, and the income tax itself are not deductible. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis.

### 5.6 Social Security (SDSS) -- Dependent Workers

For salaried workers, the employer withholds the employee SDSS share (**5.91%** = 2.87% AFP + 3.04% SFS) and pays the employer share (**~15.39%** = 7.10% AFP + 7.09% SFS + ~1.20% SRL) plus **1% INFOTEP**, each subject to its component ceiling [PwC; TSS]. Use the ceiling set matching the contribution month (Section 1).

### 5.7 Self-Employed and SDSS

Self-employed and independent professionals are **NOT mandatorily** enrolled in SDSS (the TSS mandatory contributory regime applies to dependent workers). They may affiliate **voluntarily** to access pension (AFP) and health (ARS/SFS) benefits. Do not auto-apply employee SDSS deductions to a pure freelancer unless they have opted in [TSS Preguntas Frecuentes].

### 5.8 RNC Registration

Any person carrying on business or independent professional/commercial activity must register with DGII to obtain an **RNC** (Registro Nacional del Contribuyente). Registration is free (~25 days). There is no de-minimis turnover threshold for RNC for business activity [DGII; BizLatin Hub].

### 5.9 Withholding on Payments to Individuals

When the client **pays** an individual, withholding obligations arise: **10%** on professional services (honorarios) and rentals; **2%** on technical services; remitted on **Form IR-17 by the 10th** of the following month [Decreto 139-98; P&H Law].

### 5.10 ITBIS (VAT) Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| ITBIS collected on sales (registered) | NOT income -- exclude from business income |
| Input ITBIS recovered (registered) | NOT an expense -- exclude from deductions |
| Input ITBIS blocked/non-recoverable | IS an expense -- include gross |
| Unregistered for ITBIS | Gross amounts paid are the cost |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room(s) as a percentage of total area).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity (EDESUR/EDENORTE/EDEESTE), water, internet.
- Must be a genuinely dedicated workspace; a dual-use room does not qualify.

**Conservative default:** 0% until the reviewer confirms the arrangement. **Flag for reviewer:** confirm floor-area basis and supporting NCF.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible.
- Client must maintain a mileage log (business vs total).

**Conservative default:** 0% business use until a mileage log is provided. **Flag for reviewer.**

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only (CLARO/ALTICE/VIVA). Client must provide a reasonable estimate.

**Conservative default:** 0% until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Bad Debt Write-Off

- Deductible only if income was previously declared, recovery steps were taken, and the debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag all three for the reviewer.

### 6.5 Depreciation of Capital Assets

- Capital items must be depreciated over their useful life under the Código Tributario rather than expensed.
- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the applicable category and rate (Art. 287 asset categories). Do not assume a rate.

### 6.6 Voluntary SDSS Affiliation for the Self-Employed

- If a freelancer has voluntarily affiliated, contributions are based on a declared income and may be partly deductible. Confirm the affiliation basis, the cotizable income, and the rates actually applied with the TSS.

### 6.7 Foreign-Source Income and the 3-Year Rule

- For a newly-resident individual, foreign-source investment/financial income is taxed only from the 3rd year of residence. Flag the residence start date and income source for the reviewer [PwC].

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Self-employed in the top band.**
Input: DR resident, gross professional income RD$1,200,000, deductible expenses RD$300,000, no SDSS, no withholding suffered.
Expected: Net taxable income RD$900,000. ISR = 79,776 + 25% × (900,000 − 867,123.01) = 79,776 + 8,219.25 = **RD$87,995.25**. ISR due RD$87,995.25 (no credits).

**Test 2 -- Self-employed in the 20% band.**
Input: Net taxable income RD$700,000.
Expected: ISR = 31,216 + 20% × (700,000 − 624,329.01) = 31,216 + 20% × 75,670.99 = 31,216 + 15,134.20 = **RD$46,350.20**.

**Test 3 -- Self-employed in the 15% band.**
Input: Net taxable income RD$500,000.
Expected: ISR = 0 + 15% × (500,000 − 416,220.01) = 15% × 83,779.99 = **RD$12,567.00** (RD$12,566.9985 rounded).

**Test 4 -- Below exempt threshold.**
Input: Net taxable income RD$400,000.
Expected: RD$400,000 ≤ RD$416,220 exempt threshold → **ISR = RD$0**.

**Test 5 -- ISR withheld at source offsets the liability.**
Input: Net taxable income RD$900,000 (ISR before credits RD$87,995.25); RD$30,000 ISR withheld at source on honorarios.
Expected: ISR due on IR-1 = 87,995.25 − 30,000 = **RD$57,995.25**.

**Test 6 -- Employee SDSS deduction on RD$50,000 salary (within ceilings).**
Input: Monthly salary RD$50,000, below AFP/SFS ceilings (Feb-2026 set).
Expected: Employee deduction = 5.91% × 50,000 = **RD$2,955** (2.87% AFP = RD$1,435 + 3.04% SFS = RD$1,520). Employer cost ≈ 16.39% × 50,000 = **RD$8,195** (subject to SRL 4× ceiling check) [PwC; TSS].

**Test 7 -- Honorarios paid: withholding obligation.**
Input: Gross fee RD$55,555.56 paid to an individual lawyer.
Expected: Withhold 10% = **RD$5,555.56** on Form IR-17; pay net RD$50,000.00. Expense deductible at gross RD$55,555.56.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the ISR scale to foreign-source income without confirming residence and the 3-year rule
- NEVER compute final ISR figures as definitive -- pass net taxable income to the deterministic engine and label outputs as estimated
- NEVER treat ITBIS collected on sales as business income
- NEVER treat recoverable input ITBIS as a deductible expense
- NEVER allow entertainment, personal expenses, fines, or the income tax itself as deductions
- NEVER auto-apply employee SDSS deductions to a pure self-employed person (voluntary only)
- NEVER mix SDSS ceiling sets across periods -- use the set matching the contribution month
- NEVER claim a deduction without a valid fiscal receipt (NCF)
- NEVER invent a depreciation rate -- it is a RESEARCH GAP for the reviewer
- NEVER forget the payer's own 10%/2% withholding obligations (IR-17) when paying individuals
- NEVER use an unverified FY2026 ISR scale for FY2025 income
