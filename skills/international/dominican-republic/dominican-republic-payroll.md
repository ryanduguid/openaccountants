### The single most important DR payroll fact

> **The ISR retención base = gross salary − employee AFP (2.87%) − employee SFS (3.04%).** TSS employee contributions are deducted before the income-tax scale is applied. Withholding is computed on the **annualised** base (× 12), the annual scale applied, then ÷ 12.

## Section 2 -- Social Security Deductions (TSS)

See `dominican-republic-social-contributions.md` for full detail. Payroll summary:

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Base ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| AFP — pension | 2.87% | 7.10% | 20× min cotizable wage |
| SFS — health | 3.04% | 7.09% | 10× min cotizable wage |
| SRL — occupational risk | — | ~1.20% | 4× min cotizable wage |
| INFOTEP — training | 0.50% (bonuses only) | 1.00% (payroll) | — |

**Employee payroll deduction = 5.91%** (AFP + SFS) of salario cotizable, each capped at its own ceiling. Minimum cotizable wage: **RD$21,674.80/mo** (1 Apr 2025 – 31 Jan 2026) → **RD$23,223/mo** from 1 Feb 2026. (TSS Res. 01-2025)

## Section 3 -- Income Tax Withholding (Retención de ISR)

Base = gross − employee AFP − employee SFS. Annualise (× 12), apply the scale, divide by 12.

### Annual ISR scale (DGII, FY2025)

| Annual taxable income (RD$) | Tax on lower limit | Rate on excess |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 416,220.00 | 0 | 0% (exempt) |
| 416,220.01 -- 624,329.00 | 0 | 15% over 416,220.00 |
| 624,329.01 -- 867,123.00 | RD$31,216 | 20% over 624,329.00 |
| 867,123.01 and above | RD$79,776 | 25% over 867,123.00 |

*Source: PwC (updated 5 Dec 2025); DGII escala salarial FY2025. The exempt threshold is inflation-indexed annually (FY2024 was RD$399,923). Withholding begins at ~RD$34,685/month of ISR base (416,220 ÷ 12).* **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the FY2026 scale before using it for 2026 payrolls.]**

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples (gross-to-net, monthly; Apr-2025 ceilings)

### Example 1 — Below the ISR threshold (gross RD$25,000)

- AFP employee 2.87% × 25,000 = **717.50**; SFS employee 3.04% × 25,000 = **760.00** → TSS = **1,477.50**
- ISR base = 25,000 − 1,477.50 = 23,522.50 → annualised 282,270 < 416,220 → **RD$0 ISR**
- **Net pay = 25,000 − 1,477.50 = RD$23,522.50**

### Example 2 — Mid salary (gross RD$50,000)

- AFP employee 1,435.00 + SFS employee 1,520.00 = **TSS 2,955.00**
- ISR base = 50,000 − 2,955.00 = 47,045.00 → annualised 564,540 → 15% × (564,540 − 416,220) = 15% × 148,320 = **22,248 annual** → ÷ 12 = **RD$1,854.00/month**
- **Net pay = 50,000 − 2,955.00 − 1,854.00 = RD$45,191.00**
- Employer on-cost: AFP 3,550.00 + SFS 3,545.00 + SRL 600.00 + INFOTEP 500.00 = **RD$8,195.00** → total cost **RD$58,195.00**

### Example 3 — High earner (gross RD$300,000)

- AFP employee 2.87% × 300,000 = 8,610.00; SFS employee capped at 216,748 → 3.04% × 216,748 = **6,589.14** → TSS = **15,199.14**
- ISR base = 300,000 − 15,199.14 = 284,800.86 → annualised 3,417,610 → top band: 79,776 + 25% × (3,417,610 − 867,123) = 79,776 + 637,621.75 = **717,397.75 annual** → ÷ 12 = **RD$59,783.15/month**
- **Net pay = 300,000 − 15,199.14 − 59,783.15 = RD$224,017.71**

## Section 5 -- Regalía Pascual (13th salary) & Minimum Wage

### Regalía Pascual (salario de navidad) — mandatory

= 1/12 of the ordinary salary earned in the calendar year, paid by **20 December**. **Exempt from ISR** and from AFP/SFS; INFOTEP employee 0.5% applies to it. (Código de Trabajo art. 219)

### Minimum Wage

Set by sector and employer size by the Comité Nacional de Salarios (CNS) — non-sectorised private wages depend on the company's size band. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current CNS minimum-wage schedule by sector/size.]**

## Section 6 -- Payslip & Filing Obligations

| Obligation | Channel | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| TSS contributions (AFP+SFS+SRL+INFOTEP) | TSS platform (SUIR+) | First working days of the following month |
| ISR retención on salaries | DGII — **IR-3** (monthly withholding declaration) | By the 10th of the following month |
| Annual reconciliation of withholdings | DGII — **IR-13** / annual report | Per DGII calendar |

The payslip (volante de pago) must show gross salary, AFP and SFS employee deductions, ISR retención, other authorised deductions, and net pay. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current form numbers/deadlines against DGII.]**

## Section 7 -- Common Payroll Patterns

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| NÓMINA, PAGO SUELDO, ABONO NÓMINA | Net salary disbursement |
| TSS, AFP, SFS, ARS, INFOTEP | TSS social-security remittance |
| DGII, ISR, IR-3, RETENCIÓN | ISR withholding to DGII |
| REGALÍA, SALARIO NAVIDAD | 13th salary (Dec, ISR-exempt) |

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the ISR scale to gross — the base is gross − employee AFP − employee SFS.
- NEVER compute monthly ISR by a monthly bracket lookup — annualise the base, apply the annual scale, then ÷ 12.
- NEVER apply one ceiling to all TSS funds — AFP (20×), SFS (10×), SRL (4×) each cap separately.
- NEVER withhold ISR on the regalía pascual — it is exempt.
- NEVER charge employees SRL — it is employer-only.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — label as estimated and direct to a licensed Dominican contador.
