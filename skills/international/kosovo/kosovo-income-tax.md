### Tax Rate Brackets -- Personal Income Tax (annual, 2025/2026)

Brackets are stated as **annual** amounts in the law. ATK applies them via monthly cumulative withholding for primary-employer wages. Rates in force from 23 August 2024 under Law No. 08/L-142, unchanged for 2025 and 2026 [Orbitax; ATK; PwC, last reviewed 13 Jan 2026].

| Annual taxable income (EUR) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0.00 -- 3,000.00 | 0% | EUR 0.00 |
| 3,000.01 -- 5,400.00 | 8% | EUR 192.00 |
| 5,400.01 and above | 10% | -- |

**Arithmetic note (verified):** Tax at top of the 8% band = (5,400 - 3,000) x 8% = 2,400 x 8% = EUR 192.00. Above EUR 5,400, tax = EUR 192.00 + 10% x (income - 5,400.00).

**Kosovo has no standard deduction and no personal/family allowance -- the first EUR 3,000 (0% band) IS the only general relief** [PwC Deductions].

**Secondary-employer wages** are taxed at a **flat 10%** with no 0%/8% bands, since the graduated bands apply only to the primary employer [ATK; PwC].

### Self-Employed Taxation Methods

| Method | Eligibility | Rate | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gross-income (turnover) method -- trade | Annual gross income up to EUR 50,000 [caveat: see RESEARCH GAP below] | 3% of gross receipts (trade, transport, agriculture and similar) | PwC Corporate other taxes / income determination |
| Gross-income (turnover) method -- services | Annual gross income up to EUR 50,000 [caveat: see RESEARCH GAP below] | 9% of gross receipts (services, professional, vocational, entertainment and similar) | PwC Corporate other taxes / income determination |
| Real-income method | Annual gross income over EUR 50,000 (mandatory), or elected voluntarily below the threshold | 10% on net taxable profit; business deductions follow corporate rules | PwC Deductions / Corporate |
| Minimum quarterly payment (gross-income method) | Applies under the gross-income method | EUR 37.50 per quarter | PwC Corporate other taxes |

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Most sources (PwC corporate/individual summaries, secondary payroll guides) state the gross-income-method election ceiling is **EUR 50,000** annual gross income. A **EUR 30,000** figure also appears in some sources for the CIT/VAT context (small-business turnover and VAT registration). Confirm against the consolidated text of PIT Law No. 08/L-110 whether the gross-income election ceiling is EUR 50,000 (used here) or EUR 30,000.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Residency status unknown | STOP -- do not compute without confirming Kosovo tax residency (worldwide vs Kosovo-source) |
| Self-employed activity ambiguous between trade (3%) and services (9%) | Apply 9% services rate (conservative) |
| Annual gross income exceeds EUR 50,000 | Real-income method (10% on net profit) -- mandatory above threshold [caveat: see RESEARCH GAP] |
| Secondary employment | Withhold flat 10% (no 0%/8% bands) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Pension contribution base above EUR 24,000/year | Do not contribute on the excess (cap applies) |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume not registered until turnover/registration confirmed |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) Kosovo tax residency, (b) employment vs self-employed status, and (c) for self-employed, the taxation method (gross-income 3%/9% or real-income 10%).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, Trusti/KPST pension contribution records, prior-year PD return or ATK assessment, VAT registration status, payroll WM/WR records if an employer.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, fixed-asset register, quarterly advance-payment confirmations (QS/QL), employment-income certificates, evidence of activity classification (trade vs services).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This Kosovo PIT computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation, that the correct taxation method (gross-income vs real-income) was applied, and that pension contributions reconcile to Trusti/KPST records."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-XK-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Kosovo-source income [PwC Residence]. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming Kosovo tax residency. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-XK-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and self-employed sole proprietors only. Corporate income tax (Law No. 06/L-105), partnerships, and group structures file separately. Escalate to a Kosovo-licensed accountant."

**R-XK-3 -- Cross-border / treaty.** "Non-resident and treaty-relief taxation, foreign tax credits, and permanent-establishment analysis are out of scope. Escalate to a Kosovo-licensed accountant."

**R-XK-4 -- Capital gains / property disposals.** "Capital gains and immovable-property disposal computations require specialised analysis. Escalate to a Kosovo-licensed accountant."

**R-XK-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to ATK enforcement. Late-payment interest accrues monthly up to ten years and understatement penalties run 15%-25%. Do not advise. Escalate to a Kosovo-licensed accountant immediately."

**R-XK-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Kosovo VAT (standard 18%, reduced 8%; registration above EUR 30,000 turnover), use a dedicated Kosovo VAT skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in EUR. Tax recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Self-Employed, Real-Income Method, Net Profit Computation

**Inputs:** Resident sole proprietor, real-income method. Gross receipts EUR 60,000 (over the EUR 50,000 threshold, so real-income is mandatory). Allowable business expenses EUR 22,000. Mandatory self-employed pension contribution paid EUR 1,200.

**Reasoning:**
Net taxable profit = 60,000 - 22,000 = EUR 38,000. The real-income method applies a flat 10% on net taxable profit [PwC Deductions/Corporate].

**Computation:** PIT = 38,000 x 10% = **EUR 3,800.00**.

> Note: Under the real-income method PwC states a flat 10% on net profit. This skill does **not** apply the 0%/8%/10% graduated wage brackets to self-employed business profit under the real-income method; the graduated bands govern **employment wages**. Reviewer to confirm interaction where an individual has both wage and business income. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm aggregation rule]**

### Example 2 -- Self-Employed, Gross-Income Method, Services (9%)

**Input line:**
`12/03/2025 ; PROCREDIT TRANSFER IN ; KLIENTI SH.P.K. ; PAGESE FATURA 2025-014 ; +4,500.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Annual gross receipts EUR 41,000 (under EUR 50,000), services activity. Gross-income method at 9% applies to gross receipts; no expense deductions [PwC]. Quarterly tax is 9% of that quarter's gross receipts, subject to a minimum of EUR 37.50.

**Computation (annual):** PIT = 41,000 x 9% = **EUR 3,690.00**. Each quarter pays 9% of quarterly gross receipts (minimum EUR 37.50).

**Classification:** This single credit (EUR 4,500) is gross business income; quarter's tax on it = 4,500 x 9% = EUR 405.00 (> EUR 37.50 minimum, so EUR 405.00 applies).

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed, Gross-Income Method, Trade (3%)

**Reasoning:**
Resident sole proprietor, retail trade, annual gross receipts EUR 30,000 (under EUR 50,000). Trade activity uses the 3% gross-income rate [PwC].

**Computation:** PIT = 30,000 x 3% = **EUR 900.00**. Compare quarterly: 900 / 4 = EUR 225.00 per quarter, each above the EUR 37.50 minimum.

### Example 4 -- Primary Employment Wage Withholding (graduated brackets)

**Input line:**
`31/01/2025 ; RAIFFEISEN ; EMPLOYER ABC SH.A. ; PAGA JANAR (NET) ; +1,140.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Annual gross wage EUR 14,400 (EUR 1,200/month) from the primary employer. First the mandatory employee pension of 5% is withheld and is **deductible** for PIT [PwC Other taxes]; PIT is then computed on the graduated annual brackets.

**Computation (annual basis):**
- Gross wage: EUR 14,400.00
- Employee pension 5%: 14,400 x 5% = EUR 720.00 (deductible; pensionable cap EUR 24,000/yr not exceeded)
- PIT base: 14,400 - 720 = EUR 13,680.00
- PIT: 0% on first 3,000 = EUR 0; 8% on 3,000.01-5,400 = EUR 192.00; 10% on (13,680 - 5,400) = 8,280 x 10% = EUR 828.00
- Total annual PIT = 192.00 + 828.00 = **EUR 1,020.00**
- Net annual = 14,400 - 720 - 1,020 = **EUR 12,660.00** (employer also remits its own 5% pension)

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** Whether the employee pension contribution reduces the PIT base before applying the brackets is treated here per PwC "mandatory employee contribution is tax-deductible for PIT". Confirm the exact ATK monthly cumulative-withholding mechanics (commonly EUR 250/month at 0%, 250.01-450 at 8%, over 450 at 10%) against the current ATK withholding tables/calculator.

### Example 5 -- Secondary Employment (flat 10%)

**Input line:**
`28/02/2025 ; TEB BANK ; EMPLOYER XYZ ; PAGA DYTESORE SHKURT ; +500.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Wage from a **secondary** employer. Graduated 0%/8% bands apply only to the primary employer; secondary-employer wages are withheld at a **flat 10%** [ATK; PwC].

**Computation:** PIT withheld = 500 x 10% = **EUR 50.00** per the gross secondary wage for that period.

### Example 6 -- Mandatory Pension Contribution (Trusti/KPST)

**Input line:**
`15/02/2025 ; BKT ; TRUSTI KPST ; KONTRIBUT PENSIONAL JANAR ; -120.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
On a gross wage of EUR 1,200, total mandatory pension = 10% = EUR 120.00 (5% employee EUR 60.00 + 5% employer EUR 60.00) remitted to Trusti/KPST [PwC Other taxes; BQK]. Only the employee 5% (EUR 60.00) is PIT-deductible.

**Classification:** Employee 5% (EUR 60.00) = PIT deduction; employer 5% (EUR 60.00) = employer cost, not a PIT deduction for the individual.

### Example 7 -- Dividend Received (Exempt)

**Input line:**
`20/04/2025 ; NLB BANKA ; KOMPANIA SH.P.K. ; DIVIDENDE 2024 ; +2,000.00 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Dividends received by residents and non-residents are **exempt** from PIT [PwC Income determination].

**Classification:** EXCLUDE. EUR 0 added to taxable income.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency and Scope

**Legislation:** Law No. 08/L-110.

Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Kosovo-source income [PwC Residence / Taxes on personal income]. Confirm residency before any computation.

### 5.2 Graduated PIT Rates (employment / general income)

| Annual taxable income (EUR) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0.00 -- 3,000.00 | 0% |
| 3,000.01 -- 5,400.00 | 8% |
| 5,400.01+ | 10% |

In force from 23 August 2024 (Law No. 08/L-142), unchanged for 2025/2026 [Orbitax; ATK]. No standard deduction; no personal/family allowance [PwC Deductions].

### 5.3 Self-Employed -- Gross-Income (Turnover) Method

- **3%** on gross receipts for trade, transport, agriculture and similar
- **9%** on gross receipts for services, professional, vocational, entertainment and similar
- Minimum quarterly payment **EUR 37.50**
- No expense deductions (tax is on gross receipts)
[PwC Corporate other taxes / income determination]

### 5.4 Self-Employed -- Real-Income Method

For annual gross income over EUR 50,000 (mandatory) [RESEARCH GAP -- see Section 1], or elected voluntarily below the threshold:
- **10%** on net taxable profit
- Business deductions follow corporate rules (Law No. 06/L-105)
[PwC Deductions / Corporate]

### 5.5 Exempt Income

| Item | Treatment | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends (resident and non-resident recipients) | Exempt from PIT | PwC Income determination |
| Interest on Kosovo government bonds | Exempt | PwC Income determination |

### 5.6 Mandatory Pension Contributions

| Party | Rate | Base | Cap | Reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 5% of gross wage | Gross wage | EUR 24,000/yr pensionable earnings | PwC Other taxes; BQK |
| Employer | 5% of gross wage | Gross wage | EUR 24,000/yr pensionable earnings | PwC Other taxes; BQK |
| **Total mandatory** | **10%** | Gross wage | EUR 24,000/yr | -- |

**Verification:** employee 5% + employer 5% = 10% total. Confirmed.

- Floor: statutory minimum wage. Cap: pensionable earnings above EUR 24,000/year are not subject to contributions [BQK].
- Only the **mandatory employee 5%** is PIT-deductible. Voluntary supplementary contributions (up to 15% each, max 30% combined including the mandatory portion) are **not** PIT-deductible above the mandatory rate [PwC Other taxes].
- Self-employed individuals are also obliged to pay pension contributions [ATK; payroll guides].
- Kosovo has **no separate general social-security or state health-insurance payroll tax** beyond the mandatory pension contribution **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm no health-insurance contribution introduced for 2026]**.

### 5.7 Rental Income

Where rental is an **economic activity**, rental income is taxed at **10% of gross rent per quarter** [PwC Corporate other taxes]. Otherwise classified as rental income under PIT (3%/9% gross-income or real-income treatment per classification). **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact rental withholding/quarterly rate and classification.]**

### 5.8 Charitable Donations

Charitable donations/sponsorships are deductible up to **10% of taxable income** (an additional 10% may be possible under other laws), for real/accrual-basis taxpayers only [PwC Deductions].

Inheritances/gifts to spouse, children, or parents are exempt. For other recipients, amounts over **EUR 5,000** are taxed at PIT rates (0-10%). There is **no net wealth tax** [PwC Other taxes].

### 5.10 VAT Interaction

| Scenario | PIT Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT collected on sales (registered, standard 18%) | NOT income -- exclude from business receipts |
| Input VAT recovered (registered) | NOT an expense -- exclude (real-income method) |
| Non-registered (below EUR 30,000 turnover) | VAT paid on purchases is part of the gross cost |

VAT: standard rate 18%, reduced rate 8%; mandatory registration above EUR 30,000 annual turnover (importers/exporters always) [PwC; Grant Thornton].

### 5.11 Filing, Advance Payments, Deadlines

| Item | Detail | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| Annual return (form PD) | Due 31 March of the following year; calendar tax year | PwC Tax administration |
