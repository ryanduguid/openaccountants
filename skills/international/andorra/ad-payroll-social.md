## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (IRPF)

Employers must register as a **retenidor** (withholding agent) with the DTF and withhold IRPF monthly from employees' gross wages as a payment on account of the employee's final annual IRPF liability. The DTF operates an automatic regularisation system: employees with only employment income generally do not need to file a full annual return if withholding has been correctly applied. *(Source: Govern d'Andorra IRPF FAQs; Rivermate guide)*

### 2.1 Statutory IRPF Rate Structure (Annual General Base)

- **Statutory rate structure overview** — The statutory structure has a 0% band up to €24,000 and a 10% marginal rate above €40,000. A bonification (tax relief) of up to €800 reduces the effective rate on the €24,001--€40,000 slice to approximately 5%.  _(Llei 5/2014; e-tramits.ad IRPF portal)_

**Statutory IRPF Rate Table**  _(Llei 5/2014; Assessors Associats)_

| Annual Taxable Income | Marginal Rate | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| €0 -- €24,000 | 0% | General personal minimum exemption |
| €24,001 -- €40,000 | ~5% effective | 10% statutory rate with bonification up to €800 reducing effective rate |
| Above €40,000 | 10% | *(Source: Llei 5/2014; Assessors Associats)* |

**Important:** The 5% effective rate is not a literal bracket -- it results from a bonification mechanism. The statutory marginal rate is 10% throughout the taxable base; the bonification creates the stepped effective rate in practice.

### 2.2 Employer Withholding Rate Table (Retencions)

- **Withholding rate maximum cap** — The actual withholding rates applied by employers to annual gross salary are graduated and significantly lower than the marginal statutory rates. The maximum withholding rate is 7%, even though the statutory marginal rate reaches 10%; the gap is reconciled at the annual IRPF filing.  _(Assessors Associats; Andorra Difusió report on 7% maximum withholding cap)_

**Employer Withholding Rate Table**  _(Assessors Associats; Andorra Difusió report on 7% maximum withholding cap)_

| Annual Gross Salary | Withholding Rate |
| --- | --- |
| €0 -- €27,000 | 0% |
| €27,001 -- €30,000 | 0.5% |
| €30,001 -- €40,000 | 1% |
| €40,001 -- €50,000 | 2% |
| €50,001 -- €60,000 | 3% |
| €60,001 -- €70,000 | 4% |
| €70,001 -- €80,000 | 4.5% |
| €80,001 -- €90,000 | 5% |
| €90,001 -- €100,000 | 5.5% |
| €100,001 -- €120,000 | 6% |
| €120,001 -- €150,000 | 6.5% |
| Above €150,000 | 7% (maximum) |

- **Monthly withholding computation** — Monthly withholding = (Annual gross salary × Withholding rate) ÷ 12  _(Assessors Associats)_

The DTF determines the applicable withholding percentage for each employee taking into account that employee's personal deductions (children, ascendants, mortgage relief). The table above represents the standard rates before personal deduction adjustments. Employees may request a higher withholding rate via Form 317.

### 2.3 IRPF Deductions Affecting Tax Base

**IRPF Deductions Table**  _(aaa.ad 2025 tax return guide; Bloomberg Tax IRPF 2025 filing announcement)_

| Supplemental for dependent child in higher education | €300 additional |
| Per qualifying ascendant (>65 yrs, living with taxpayer, income <€12,000) or descendant <25 | €750 |
| Primary residence mortgage: 50% of annual mortgage payments, capped | €5,000/taxpayer/year |

## Section 4 -- CASS Social Security Contributions

### 4.1 Governing Framework

- **CASS governing framework** — CASS (Caixa Andorrana de Seguretat Social) is the public social security body established under Llei 17/2008. The 2025 reference average global salary was set at €2,560.99/month by Decret 16/2025 (29 January 2025).  _(CASS official site; Elysium Consulting 2025 CASS guide)_

### 4.2 Contribution Rates -- Standard Salaried Employees (2025)

**Standard Contribution Rates Table**  _(CASS official page cass.ad/cotitzacions-recarrecs-sancions; Elysium Consulting)_

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| General Branch (health, maternity/paternity, temporary disability, death/orphan benefits) | 3.0% | 7.0% | 10.0% |
| Retirement Branch (retirement, widow/widower, survivor pensions) | 3.5% | 8.5% | 12.0% |
| **TOTAL** | **6.5%** | **15.5%** | **22.0%** |

| Retirement Branch | Not applicable | Not applicable | -- |
| **TOTAL** | **3.0%** | **7.0%** | **10.0%** |

### 4.3 Occupational Accident Coverage

- **Occupational accident coverage** — There is no separate employer occupational risk premium. Occupational accidents and diseases are covered within the General Branch. The standard 15.5% employer contribution subsumes this coverage.  _(Elysium Consulting CASS 2025 guide)_

### 4.4 Contribution Base

- **Included in contribution base** — Regular salary, supplements, bonuses, benefits-in-kind (housing, meals, company car), indemnities.
- **Excluded from contribution base** — Tips, company liberalities, meal/travel expense reimbursements, employer contributions to supplementary (occupational) pension plans.
- **CASS contribution ceiling (self-employed, 2025)** — €3,520.36/month (137.5% of the average monthly salary)  _(CASS official pages; Elysium Consulting)_

**Ceiling (plafó):** A formal government-set contribution ceiling exists under Llei 17/2008. The exact 2025 ceiling for salaried employees is **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm: contact CASS directly or check latest BOPA decree]**. For self-employed workers the 2025 ceiling is €3,520.36/month (137.5% of the average monthly salary). *(Source: CASS official pages; Elysium Consulting)*

**Floor:** No explicit contribution floor for salaried workers confirmed in public sources. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm with CASS]**

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults Table**

| Parameter | Conservative Default | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| IRPF withholding rate | Per withholding table based on annual gross salary; 0% if annual gross ≤€27,000 | Decret 596/2023; Assessors Associats |
| Employee CASS | 6.5% of gross salary | CASS official; Llei 17/2008 |
| Employer CASS | 15.5% of gross salary | CASS official; Llei 17/2008 |
| CASS contribution ceiling (salaried) | [RESEARCH GAP -- apply contributions on full gross until ceiling confirmed with CASS] |  |
| Tax residency status | Resident (apply IRPF rates) | Only override if non-residency is confirmed |
| Personal deductions | None (standard: no adjustments) | Deductions require employee declaration |
| Pay frequency | Monthly | Standard Andorran practice |
| Currency | EUR | Only currency used in Andorra |

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs

Before computing Andorra payroll, you MUST have:

1. **Employee tax residency status** -- resident (IRPF) or non-resident (IRNR)
2. **Annual gross salary** -- to determine correct withholding rate band
3. **Monthly gross salary** -- for computation of monthly amounts
4. **CASS registration status** -- confirm both employer and employee are registered
5. **Personal deduction declarations** -- children, ascendants, mortgage if applicable (affects DTF-determined withholding rate)
6. **Pension-drawing status** -- if employee is already receiving a retirement pension, different CASS rates apply
7. **Employment start date** -- for pro-rating partial months

### Refusal Catalogue

- **Unknown residency status** — Cannot determine whether IRPF or IRNR applies
- **Salary in non-EUR currency** — Andorra uses EUR exclusively; flag if any other currency is mentioned
- **Double-taxation treaty claim** — Treaty benefit cannot be applied without knowing employee's country of tax residence and the specific treaty provisions -- direct to qualified adviser
- **CASS ceiling uncertainty** — If salary may exceed the (unconfirmed) CASS ceiling, output must be flagged as potentially overstated and marked [RESEARCH GAP]
- **Benefits-in-kind valuation** — Housing, vehicles, and meal benefits require valuation -- do not guess
- **Termination payments** — Indemnification amounts under Andorran labour law require legal advice before payroll treatment can be determined

## Section 8 -- Transaction and Payment Pattern Library

This section enables recognition and classification of Andorra-specific payroll entries on bank statements and in accounting records.

### 8.1 Employee Bank Statement Patterns (Salary Credits)

**Employee Bank Statement Patterns Table**

| Pattern Observed | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| NOMINA, SALARI, SUELDO | Net salary payment (credit to employee) |
| PAGAMENT NOMINA [employer name] | Net salary payment |
| TRANSFERENCIA NOMINA | Net salary payment |
| BONUS, PRIMA, GRATIFICACIÓ | Discretionary bonus or one-off payment |
| LIQUIDACIÓ, INDEMNITZACIÓ | Termination payment -- requires separate tax/CASS analysis |
| PAGA EXTRA | Extra salary payment (if contractual 13th/14th month exists) |
| DIETES, DESPLAÇAMENT | Per diems / travel reimbursement -- generally not subject to CASS/IRPF if genuine expense reimbursement |

### 8.2 Employer Bank Statement Patterns (Payroll Debits)

**Employer Bank Statement Patterns Table**

| Pattern Observed | Classification |
| --- | --- |
| CASS-0031, COTITZACIO CASS | Monthly CASS contribution payment (employer + employee shares) |
| CASS [employer number] | CASS remittance |
| DTF IRPF, RETENCIO IRPF, TRIBUTS | IRPF withholding remittance to DTF |
| DTF IRNR, RETENCIO IRNR | IRNR withholding remittance (non-resident employees) |
| PAGAMENT NOMINES, TRANSFERENCIES NOMINA | Bulk salary disbursement to employees |
| SEGURETAT SOCIAL, COTITZACIONS | Social security contributions (CASS) |

### 8.3 CASS-0031 Form Classification

- **CASS-0031 form** — The CASS-0031 form ("Full de declaració de cotitzacions i retencions IRPF/IRNR") is a combined monthly declaration covering both CASS contributions and IRPF/IRNR withholdings. A single monthly payment/declaration to CASS covers both obligations for most employers.  _(CASS-0031 form page cass.ad/tramits/cass-0031)_

### 9.1 CASS Monthly Declaration (CASS-0031)

**CASS Monthly Declaration Table**  _(CASS official CASS-0031 page; CASS contributions page)_

| Item | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Form | CASS-0031 "Full de declaració de cotitzacions i retencions IRPF/IRNR" |
| Frequency | Monthly |
| Deadline | 1st--15th of the month following the salary payment period |
| Content | Employer CASS (15.5%), employee CASS (6.5%), IRPF/IRNR withholdings |
| Who pays | Employer remits both shares (deducts employee 6.5% from wages, adds employer 15.5%) |
| Portal | cass.ad |

### 9.2 IRPF Withholding Forms (Filed with DTF)

**IRPF Withholding Forms Table**  _(e-tramits.ad IRPF forms page; Govern.ad forms)_

| Form | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Form 310 | Self-assessment of withholdings on employment income NOT subject to CASS (e.g., some border-worker income) |
| Form 312 | Self-assessment of withholdings on employment income subject to CASS obligations |
| Form 312-A | Additional or late withholding self-assessments |
| Form 315 | Communication of withholding data to individual employee |
| Form 316 | Notification of changes in withholding amount |
| Form 317 | Employee request for higher withholding percentage |
| Form 311 | Annual withholding summary (non-CASS employment income) |
| Form 311-A | Annex to Form 311 |
| Form 340 | Self-assessment of withholdings on investment/movable capital income |
| Form 341 | Annual summary of capital income withholdings |

Because CASS-0031 already captures the monthly IRPF remittance for most salaried employees (combined CASS + IRPF declaration), Forms 310/312 may apply primarily for out-of-CASS situations. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the exact interaction between CASS-0031 and the separate DTF forms for a typical Andorran employer]**

### 9.3 IRPF Withholding Payment Frequency and Deadlines

## Section 12 -- Tier 1 Rules (Always Apply)

These rules have no exceptions in standard Andorran payroll. Violating any of them constitutes a processing error.

- **Register with CASS before first hire** — Employers must obtain a CASS employer number before the employee's first working day. New hires must be individually registered within 5 days of hire.  _(Llei 17/2008)_
- **Register as retenidor with DTF before paying wages** — The DTF registration as withholding agent is mandatory before any employment income is paid.  _(Llei 5/2014)_
- **Always deduct employee CASS at 6.5%** — For standard employees, 6.5% of gross salary is deducted from employee wages and remitted to CASS with the employer's 15.5% share via CASS-0031. Exception: employees drawing a retirement pension pay 3.0% (general branch only).
- **Always add employer CASS at 15.5%** — Employer must contribute 15.5% of the employee's gross salary. This is an employer cost over and above the gross salary. Exception: employees drawing a retirement pension -- employer pays 7.0% only.
- **File CASS-0031 monthly by the 15th** — The combined CASS contribution and IRPF/IRNR withholding declaration must be submitted to CASS by the 15th of the month following the salary period. Late payment triggers surcharges starting at 5%.
- **Never pay below the minimum wage** — For 2025: €8.35/hour or €1,447.33/month for a standard 40-hour week.  _(Decret 4/2025)_
- **Apply IRPF or IRNR -- never both** — Resident employees are subject to IRPF withholding (per the graduated table). Non-resident employees are subject to IRNR at 10% flat. Determine residency status before computing any withholding.
- **Maximum IRPF withholding rate is 7%** — Even for very high earners, the employer withholding rate is capped at 7% (per Andorra Difusió / Assessors Associats). The gap between withheld and final statutory liability is settled via the annual IRPF return.  _(Andorra Difusió / Assessors Associats)_
- **All amounts in EUR** — Andorra has no domestic currency; all payroll must be computed and paid in EUR.

## Section 13 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

These items involve judgement, incomplete research data, or complexity that requires a qualified Andorran adviser to resolve before finalising payroll.

**Tier 2 Catalogue Table**

| Situation | Issue | Action Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Employee claims personal deductions (children, ascendants, mortgage) | Deductions affect DTF-determined withholding rate; standard table above does not reflect these | Obtain signed employee declaration; submit deduction data to DTF to get adjusted withholding rate |
| Salary exceeds possible CASS ceiling | Exact 2025 CASS contribution ceiling for salaried employees not confirmed in any reviewed public source | Contact CASS directly or check latest BOPA decree before computing on salaries that may be near the ceiling |
| Double-taxation treaty relief claim | Employee is resident in Spain, France, Portugal, Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Malta, Cyprus, Hungary, San Marino, or UAE | Review specific treaty provisions; do not apply treaty relief without written professional advice |
| Benefits-in-kind (housing, vehicle, meals) | Must be included in CASS contribution base; IRPF valuation rules apply | Obtain market-value assessment; apply per DTF/CASS guidance on benefit valuation |
| Termination/indemnification payments | May be partially or fully exempt from IRPF; CASS treatment depends on nature of payment | Consult Andorran labour and tax adviser before processing |
| Self-employed / mixed-employment status | IRPF applies to employment income; economic activity income has separate rules | Do not commingle in payroll computation; separate income streams require separate IRPF declarations |
| CASS contribution floor for salaried workers | Floor not confirmed in public sources reviewed | Verify with CASS |
| Annual IRPF employer summary deadline | Secondary sources cite "end of February/March" -- exact date not confirmed | Verify exact deadline with DTF before processing year-end reconciliation |
| IRPF penalty schedule | Specific penalty amounts/percentages not published in reviewed sources | Consult DTF or Llei 5/2014 sanction provisions directly |
| CASS-0031 vs. separate DTF forms interaction | Precise workflow for simultaneous CASS and DTF filing needs local practitioner confirmation | Confirm with DTF and a local assessor fiscal before first payroll run |

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you are asked to process Andorra payroll and any of the following conditions apply, stop and request clarification before computing:

1. **Residency status unknown:** Ask whether the employee is an Andorran tax resident. IRPF rates and IRNR rates differ substantially.

2. **Salary figures missing:** Both monthly gross and annual gross are needed to identify the correct IRPF withholding rate band.

3. **CASS registration not confirmed:** Ask whether the employer is registered with CASS and whether the employee has been individually registered. If not, payroll cannot legally begin.

4. **Pension-drawing status unknown:** If the employee is of retirement age, ask whether they are already drawing a CASS pension, as this halves the CASS rate.

5. **Treaty claim indicated:** If the employee mentions being resident in Spain, France, or any of the other treaty countries, pause and direct to a qualified adviser before applying any exemption.

6. **Benefit-in-kind components:** If housing, vehicle, or meals are part of the package, flag that these must be valued and included in the CASS base before net pay can be computed.

**Default response when blocked:**
> "I need [missing item] before I can compute an accurate Andorra payroll. Andorra's IRPF withholding rates vary significantly by salary band and residency status, and CASS registration must be confirmed before the first payroll run. Please provide [specific item] or consult a qualified Andorran assessor fiscal."

## Section 18 -- Test Suite

All computations below were verified arithmetically before inclusion. Run these to validate any implementation of this skill.

**Test 1:** Employee, annual gross €20,000, resident, no deductions.
- Annual gross €20,000 < €27,000 → Withholding rate 0%
- Monthly gross: 20,000 ÷ 12 = €1,666.67
- Monthly IRPF: €0.00
- Employee CASS: 1,666.67 × 6.5% = €108.33
- Net pay: 1,666.67 − 0.00 − 108.33 = **€1,558.34**
- Employer CASS: 1,666.67 × 15.5% = €258.33
- Total employer cost: 1,666.67 + 258.33 = **€1,925.00**

- Monthly IRPF: (60,000 × 3%) ÷ 12 = 1,800 ÷ 12 = **€150.00**
- Employee CASS: 5,000.00 × 6.5% = **€325.00**
- Net pay: 5,000.00 − 150.00 − 325.00 = **€4,525.00**
- Employer CASS: 5,000.00 × 15.5% = **€775.00**
- Total employer cost: 5,000.00 + 775.00 = **€5,775.00**

- IRNR (10% flat): 4,000.00 × 10% = **€400.00**
- Employee CASS: 4,000.00 × 6.5% = **€260.00**
- Net pay: 4,000.00 − 400.00 − 260.00 = **€3,340.00**
- Employer CASS: 4,000.00 × 15.5% = **€620.00**
- Total employer cost: 4,000.00 + 620.00 = **€4,620.00**
- Reconciliation: 3,340.00 + 400.00 + 260.00 = 4,000.00 ✓

- Annual gross €18,000 < €27,000 → IRPF withholding rate 0%
- Employee CASS (general branch only, 3.0%): 1,500.00 × 3.0% = **€45.00**
- Net pay: 1,500.00 − 0.00 − 45.00 = **€1,455.00**
- Employer CASS (general branch only, 7.0%): 1,500.00 × 7.0% = **€105.00**
- Total employer cost: 1,500.00 + 105.00 = **€1,605.00**

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Residency determination required** — NEVER process Andorra payroll without confirming the employee's tax residency status (resident → IRPF; non-resident → IRNR; never apply both)  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Employer CASS mandatory** — NEVER omit employer CASS (15.5%) -- it is a mandatory employer cost above and beyond gross salary  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Employee CASS mandatory** — NEVER omit employee CASS (6.5%) deduction from net pay  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **IRPF withholding cap** — NEVER apply IRPF withholding rate above 7% even if the statutory marginal rate is 10% -- the cap is 7% at source; balance settles at annual filing  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Personal deductions require signed declaration** — NEVER assume an employee's personal deductions without a signed declaration -- use the standard withholding table and flag that deductions may adjust the rate  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Registration confirmation before payroll** — NEVER commence payroll before CASS employer registration and DTF retenidor registration are confirmed  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **CASS-0031 deadline** — NEVER miss the CASS-0031 monthly deadline (15th of following month) -- late surcharges begin at 5%  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Minimum wage compliance** — NEVER pay below the statutory minimum wage: €8.35/hour or €1,447.33/month (2025, Decret 4/2025)  _(PROHIBITIONS; Decret 4/2025)_
- **Treaty relief requires opinion** — NEVER apply treaty relief without a written professional opinion confirming eligibility and the specific treaty provisions  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **CASS ceiling research gap flag** — NEVER compute CASS contributions on a high-salary employee without flagging the unconfirmed CASS contribution ceiling (RESEARCH GAP -- Section 4.4)  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
- **Computations not definitive** — NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a qualified Andorran assessor fiscal for review  _(PROHIBITIONS)_
