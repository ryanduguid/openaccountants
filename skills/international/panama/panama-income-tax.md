### Income Tax Rate Brackets (tax year 2025)

Progressive, applied to Panamanian-source taxable income (PwC, taxes-on-personal-income — reviewed 18 Jan 2026):

| Taxable Income (USD) | Tax on this band | Cumulative Tax at Top of Band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 11,000 | 0% | USD 0 |
| 11,001 – 50,000 | 15% on excess over 11,000 | USD 5,850 |
| Over 50,000 | USD 5,850 fixed + 25% on excess over 50,000 | — |

**Arithmetic check.** Top of the 15% band: (50,000 − 11,000) × 15% = 39,000 × 15% = USD 5,850. The "Over 50,000" row therefore carries a fixed base of USD 5,850 plus 25% on the excess.

**Territorial rule.** Citizens, residents, and non-residents are taxed **only on Panama-source income**. Non-residents' Panama-source income is generally subject to **withholding by the payer** (PwC, taxes-on-personal-income).

### Personal Deductions / Allowances (tax year 2025)

| Deduction | Cap | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal exemption (married individual) | USD 800 | PwC, deductions |
| Per-dependent deduction (USD 250) | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** secondary sources cite "$800 basic + $250 per dependent" but PwC authoritative page does not confirm the $250 figure | Unconfirmed |
| Mortgage interest (primary home in Panama or home improvements) | up to USD 15,000/year | PwC, deductions |
| Retirement / pension fund contributions | up to USD 15,000 | PwC, deductions |
| Education expenses | up to USD 3,600 per student (since Jan 2019) | PwC, deductions |
| Medical expenses incurred in Panama | deductible, documented; no cap stated | PwC, deductions |
| Charitable donations (approved local educational/charitable institutions + non-profit dues) | max USD 50,000/year | PwC, deductions |
| Unreimbursed employment expenses (moving, travel, entertainment) | NOT deductible | PwC, deductions |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Source of income unknown (Panama vs foreign) | STOP — territorial rule means foreign-source income is exempt; confirm source before including |
| Resident vs non-resident unknown | Treat as STOP — non-residents are subject to withholding, not self-assessment |
| Unknown marital status | Apply no personal exemption (the USD 800 exemption is married-only per PwC) |
| Unknown dependent count | 0 dependents (the $250/dependent figure is unconfirmed anyway) |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Deduction lacks documentation | Not deductible |
| Whether worker is employee or independent | STOP — determines CSS treatment (9.75% employee vs 9.36% IVM independent) |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text; confirmation of residency status (resident/non-resident); confirmation of whether income is Panama-source; and worker classification (employee vs self-employed/independent).

**Recommended** — all invoices/receipts (facturas) issued and received, CSS payment records, prior-year declaración jurada de rentas or DGI assessment, RUC (Registro Único de Contribuyente) number, marital status and dependent count.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account, mortgage interest certificate, pension contribution certificates, education and medical receipts, estimated-tax instalment confirmations, employer payroll records (planilla).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This return was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify Panama-source classification and that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-PA-1 — Source of income unclear.** "Panama taxes on a strictly territorial basis. Income from foreign sources is not taxable. This skill cannot proceed until the Panama-source vs foreign-source split is confirmed for each income stream. Escalate to a licensed accountant if the source is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. services partly performed abroad)."

**R-PA-2 — Non-resident self-assessment.** "Non-residents' Panama-source income is generally taxed by withholding at the payer, not by self-assessed return. This skill covers resident individual returns. Escalate to a licensed accountant for non-resident withholding analysis."

**R-PA-3 — Companies, partnerships, foundations.** "This skill covers natural persons (individuals and self-employed) only. Corporations (sociedades anónimas), partnerships, and private-interest foundations file separate corporate returns. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-PA-4 — Capital gains / real-estate transfers.** "Gains on disposal of real estate and securities are taxed under separate regimes (transfer tax / advance ISR on real estate). Out of scope. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-PA-5 — Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding DGI arrears or risk of suspension of the Aviso de Operación. Penalties can be automatically generated from USD 500 upward [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the DGI primary penalty schedule]. Do not advise. Escalate to a licensed accountant immediately."

**R-PA-6 — Special regimes (SEM, City of Knowledge, Colón Free Zone, Panama-Pacífico).** "These regimes have bespoke income tax and social-security treatment. Out of scope. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Panamanian statements are usually in Spanish. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules. **Always confirm Panama-source before treating any credit as taxable income.**

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Créditos)

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Client Payment (Panama-source professional fee)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; TRANSFERENCIA ACH ; CORPORACIÓN ISTMO S.A. ; HONORARIOS FACTURA 0042 ; +3,500.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Professional fee from a Panamanian company for services performed in Panama. Panama-source business income. No VAT-style gross-up applies to ISR base (Panama's consumption tax is ITBMS, handled separately). Full USD 3,500 is taxable income.

**Classification:** Taxable income = USD 3,500.

### Example 2 — Software Subscription (Deductible business expense)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2025 ; CARGO TARJETA ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD ABRIL ; -52.99 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Recurring SaaS subscription used to produce business income. Ordinary and necessary business expense, fully deductible for a self-employed taxpayer.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense = USD 52.99.

### Example 3 — Client Entertainment (Blocked)

**Input line:**
`22/04/2025 ; COMPRA TARJETA ; RESTAURANTE MARKET ; CENA CLIENTE ; -120.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Entertainment. Unreimbursed entertainment is not deductible per PwC deductions guidance. No partial deduction.

**Classification:** NOT deductible. Remove entirely.

### Example 4 — Employee CSS + Educational Insurance Deduction (payroll)

**Input:** Monthly gross salary USD 2,000, employee, current (from April 2025) rates.

**Reasoning:**
- Employee CSS: 2,000 × 9.75% = USD 195.00 (PwC, other-taxes)
- Educational insurance (employee): 2,000 × 1.25% = USD 25.00 (PwC, other-taxes; FMM)
- Total employee statutory withholding = 195.00 + 25.00 = **USD 220.00**
- No salary ceiling applies (PwC, other-taxes)

**Classification:** Employee statutory deductions = USD 220.00/month. (ISR withholding computed separately on the progressive table.)

### Example 5 — Self-Employed Annual ISR (mid-range, Panama-source)

**Input:** Resident self-employed, Panama-source net taxable income USD 40,000 (after allowable business expenses), no confirmed personal deductions.

**Reasoning:**
- Falls in the 11,001–50,000 band.
- Tax = (40,000 − 11,000) × 15% = 29,000 × 15% = **USD 4,350.00**

**Classification:** ISR due = USD 4,350.00.

### Example 6 — Higher-Income Self-Employed (top bracket)

**Input:** Resident self-employed, Panama-source net taxable income USD 75,000.

**Reasoning:**
- Falls in the "Over 50,000" band.
- Tax = 5,850 fixed + (75,000 − 50,000) × 25% = 5,850 + 25,000 × 25% = 5,850 + 6,250 = **USD 12,100.00**

**Classification:** ISR due = USD 12,100.00.

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Territorial Source Rule

**Basis:** PwC, taxes-on-personal-income.

Only Panamanian-source income is taxable, for residents and non-residents alike. Income from services performed, or assets located, outside Panama is **not taxable** regardless of where it is received or banked. Classify the source of every income stream before computing tax. When source is genuinely ambiguous (e.g. cross-border services), invoke R-PA-1.

### 5.2 Progressive ISR Computation (natural persons)

**Basis:** PwC, taxes-on-personal-income (reviewed 18 Jan 2026).

| Taxable Income (USD) | Computation |
|---|---|
| 0 – 11,000 | USD 0 |
| 11,001 – 50,000 | (income − 11,000) × 15% |
| Over 50,000 | 5,850 + (income − 50,000) × 25% |

No local/municipal income tax; no individual alternate minimum tax.

### 5.3 Exempt Income

**Basis:** PwC, taxes-on-personal-income.

- Interest on Panamanian government securities.
- Interest on Panamanian bank savings accounts and time deposits.
- Foreign-source income (territorial rule).

### 5.4 Personal Deductions

**Basis:** PwC, deductions. See Section 1 table. Key caps: personal exemption USD 800 (married); mortgage interest USD 15,000; pension USD 15,000; education USD 3,600/student; charitable donations USD 50,000; medical (no cap stated). All require documentation. The USD 250/dependent figure is **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

### 5.5 Social Security (CSS) + Educational Insurance — Law 462 of 18 March 2025

**Basis:** PwC, other-taxes; Fábrega Molino (FMM); Morgan & Morgan.

**Employees (current, from April 2025 payroll):**

| Component | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CSS (employee) | 9.75% of gross salary | PwC, other-taxes; FMM |
| Educational insurance (employee) | 1.25% of salary | PwC, other-taxes; FMM |
| **Total employee** | **11.00%** | sum: 9.75 + 1.25 = 11.00 |

**Employers (phased increase under Law 462):**

| Component | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CSS (employer) — from 1 Apr 2025 | 13.25% | PwC, other-taxes; Morgan & Morgan |
| CSS (employer) — from 1 Mar 2027 | 14.25% | Morgan & Morgan |
| CSS (employer) — from 1 Mar 2029 | 15.25% | Morgan & Morgan |
| Educational insurance (employer) | 1.50% of salary | PwC, other-taxes |
| **Total employer (current, from Apr 2025)** | **14.75%** | sum: 13.25 + 1.50 = 14.75 |

**Combined headline (current, from April 2025):**

| Party | CSS | Educational insurance | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 9.75% | 1.25% | 11.00% |
| Employer | 13.25% | 1.50% | 14.75% |
| **Combined** | **23.00%** | **2.75%** | **25.75%** |

**Arithmetic check.** Employee column: 9.75 + 1.25 = 11.00. Employer column: 13.25 + 1.50 = 14.75. Combined CSS: 9.75 + 13.25 = 23.00. Combined education: 1.25 + 1.50 = 2.75. Combined total: 11.00 + 14.75 = 25.75 (= 23.00 + 2.75). All reconcile.

**Salary ceiling/floor:** CSS and educational insurance apply with **no maximum taxable limit** (no ceiling) and no floor for employees (PwC, other-taxes).

### 5.6 Self-Employed / Independent Workers (NEW under Law 462)

**Basis:** Morgan & Morgan; Pension Policy International.

| Component | Rate | Status |
|---|---|---|
| IVM (Disability, Old Age, Death) | 9.36% of taxable income | Mandatory |
| Health & maternity program | additional 8.5% of declared contributory income | Voluntary (opt-in); if opted in, declared base ≥ USD 800/month |

- Independent/self-employed workers must now register with CSS for the first time.
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the income threshold (if any) below which independents are exempt from the mandatory 9.36% IVM contribution; verify against CSS / Law 462 primary text.

### 5.7 Retirement Age (unchanged by Law 462)

**Basis:** FMM. Women: 57. Men: 62. Subject to future actuarial review.

### 5.8 Filing, Estimated Tax, and Withholding

**Basis:** PwC, tax-administration; Casattis.

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Tax year | Calendar year |
| Filing deadline (individuals) | 15 March following the tax year (FY2025 due 15 March 2026) |
| Extension | One-month extension on request before the deadline |
| Filing platform | e-Tax 2.0 (DGI online portal) |
| Estimated tax instalments | Three equal instalments: 30 June, 30 September, 31 December |
| Who must file | All taxpayers **except** employees with a single salary source where the employer withholds. Must file if claiming non-business expenses, or receiving representation allowances / salary in kind |
| Non-residents | Panama-source income subject to withholding by the payer |
| Form code | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact DGI individual return form code (commonly the "Declaración Jurada de Rentas" for personas naturales; PwC does not give a form number) |

### 5.9 Non-Deductible Expenses (summary)

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Entertainment (unreimbursed) | Blocked (PwC, deductions) |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax (ISR) itself | Tax on income |
| Unreimbursed moving/travel (employees) | Blocked (PwC, deductions) |

## Section 9 — Onboarding Fallback

If the client provides a bank statement but cannot answer onboarding questions immediately:

1. Classify all transactions using the pattern library (Section 3).
2. Mark all source-ambiguous credits and all Tier 2 items as "PENDING — reviewer must confirm".
3. Apply conservative defaults (Section 1) — including 0% personal deductions where undocumented and excluding foreign-source income only where confirmed.
4. Generate the working paper (Section 7) with clear flags.
5. Present the following questions to the client:

```
ONBOARDING QUESTIONS — PANAMA INCOME TAX
1. Are you a Panama tax resident or non-resident?
2. For each income stream: were the services performed (or assets located) in Panama, or abroad?
3. Worker type: employee (on a planilla) or self-employed/independent?
4. Marital status (single/married) and number of dependents?
5. Do you have deductible: mortgage interest, pension contributions, education,
   medical (in Panama), or charitable donations? Amounts and receipts?
6. Do you operate a business? If so, do you have a RUC and Aviso de Operación?
7. CSS: how much was contributed in the year? (employee 9.75% / independent IVM 9.36%)
8. Did you make estimated tax instalments (Jun/Sep/Dec)? Amounts?
9. Was any ISR withheld at source?
10. Did you receive a décimo tercer mes (13th-month bonus)?
```

### 10.1 Penalties (less authoritative — law-firm sourced)

- Late/non-filing fines can be automatically generated from **USD 500 (B/. 500.00)** upward, with risk of tax audit or suspension of the Aviso de Operación (Limitless Legal).
- Companies with an active Aviso de Operación but zero income must still file a zero-income return or face automatic fines (Limitless Legal).
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** no DGI primary-source penalty schedule (late-payment interest rate, surcharge %) was located; verify against the Código Fiscal / DGI.

### 10.2 Minimum Wage

- Panama sets minimum wage **by hourly rate**, differentiated across **59 rates covering 74 economic activities**, by region (Region 1 / Region 2), sector, and company size. There is **no single national monthly figure** (Galindo Arias & López; MITRADEL).
- Current (2026–2027 period): **Executive Decree No. 13 of 31 Dec 2025**, published 6 Jan 2026, **effective 16 January 2026**. Example cited: ~USD 320.00/month for some Region 2 categories (Lovill; Galindo Arias & López).
- **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact applicable cell must be read per activity/region/company-size from Decree No. 13/2025 (Gaceta Oficial). No single number applies.

### 10.3 Registration

- Taxpayers register via the **RUC (Registro Único de Contribuyente)**; DGI ran mandatory RUC/TIN update campaigns through 2025. Businesses need an **Aviso de Operación** (KPMG; FMM — general, not re-verified to a primary source in this pass).

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Mid-range self-employed ISR.**
Input: Resident self-employed, Panama-source taxable income USD 40,000, no confirmed personal deductions.
Expected: 40,000 in the 11,001–50,000 band. ISR = (40,000 − 11,000) × 15% = 29,000 × 15% = **USD 4,350.00**.

**Test 2 — Top-bracket self-employed ISR.**
Input: Resident self-employed, Panama-source taxable income USD 75,000.
Expected: ISR = 5,850 + (75,000 − 50,000) × 25% = 5,850 + 6,250 = **USD 12,100.00**.

**Test 3 — Zero-tax band.**
Input: Resident, Panama-source taxable income USD 11,000.
Expected: ISR = **USD 0.00** (top of the 0% band).

**Test 4 — Lower 15% band.**
Input: Resident, Panama-source taxable income USD 25,000.
Expected: ISR = (25,000 − 11,000) × 15% = 14,000 × 15% = **USD 2,100.00**.

**Test 5 — Employee payroll deductions.**
Input: Employee, monthly gross salary USD 2,000 (current rates from April 2025).
Expected: Employee CSS = 2,000 × 9.75% = 195.00; educational insurance = 2,000 × 1.25% = 25.00; total employee statutory = **USD 220.00**. No salary ceiling.

**Test 6 — Employer cost (combined).**
Input: Same USD 2,000 salary, employer side (from April 2025).
Expected: Employer CSS = 2,000 × 13.25% = 265.00; employer educational insurance = 2,000 × 1.50% = 30.00; total employer statutory = **USD 295.00** (14.75% of 2,000).

**Test 7 — Exempt interest excluded.**
Input: USD 1,200 interest credited from a Panamanian bank time deposit.
Expected: EXCLUDE — exempt income (PwC, taxes-on-personal-income). Not in taxable income.

**Test 8 — Foreign-source excluded.**
Input: USD 5,000 received for consulting work performed entirely abroad for a foreign client.
Expected: EXCLUDE — foreign-source income is not taxable under the territorial rule. Confirm source with reviewer (R-PA-1).

**Test 9 — Independent IVM contribution.**
Input: Self-employed independent, taxable income base USD 30,000/year, did not opt into health & maternity.
Expected: Mandatory IVM = 30,000 × 9.36% = **USD 2,808.00**. No 8.5% health/maternity (not opted in). [Confirm any exemption threshold — RESEARCH GAP.]

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER tax foreign-source income — Panama is strictly territorial.
- NEVER include exempt interest (Panamanian bank savings/time deposits, government securities) in taxable income.
- NEVER compute ISR for a non-resident as a self-assessed return — non-residents are taxed by withholding (R-PA-2).
- NEVER claim a personal deduction above its statutory cap (mortgage 15,000; pension 15,000; education 3,600/student; donations 50,000).
- NEVER claim the USD 250/dependent deduction as fact — it is unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER allow entertainment, fines, ISR itself, or drawings as deductions.
- NEVER apply a salary ceiling to CSS or educational insurance — there is none.
- NEVER confuse the employee CSS rate (9.75%) with the independent IVM rate (9.36%).
- NEVER state a penalty schedule or a minimum-wage figure as confirmed — both carry RESEARCH GAP markers.
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pass the bracket computation to the deterministic engine.
