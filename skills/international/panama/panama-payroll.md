## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (ISR on salaries)

The employer withholds **ISR** monthly from "wages, salaries, and other remuneration for personal services." Panama taxes only **Panamanian-source** income (territorial system). The withholding is computed by **projecting/annualising** monthly income — multiply the monthly salary by **13** (12 months + the décimo/XIII month) to estimate annual income, apply the bracket table to the annual figure, then deduct proportionally each month (one-twelfth of the annual liability). Source: PwC *Panama — Individual — Tax administration*; method consistency across secondary payroll guides.

### ISR Brackets (annual net taxable income, B/. = USD)

Source: DGI *Tarifa* page (https://dgi.mef.gob.pa/DInforme/Tarifa) and PwC *Taxes on personal income* (tax year 2026, last reviewed 18 Jan 2026).

| Annual net taxable income (B/.) | Marginal rate | Tax on the band (B/.) | Cumulative tax at top of band (B/.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 to 11,000 | 0% (exento) | 0 | 0 |
| over 11,000 to 50,000 | 15% | 5,850 | 5,850 |
| over 50,000 | 25% | (open) | (open) |

Cumulative-tax check: 15% × (50,000 − 11,000) = 15% × 39,000 = **5,850** at B/.50,000. Tax above that point = 5,850 + 25% × (annual income − 50,000). ✔

- **No local / municipal income taxes** on salaries. (PwC)
- The first **B/.11,000** of annual income is exempt — this 0% band IS the tax-free allowance.

### Computation Method (employer withholding)

1. Take the employee's **monthly gross remuneration** and project annual income = monthly × **13** (12 + décimo). (PwC / secondary payroll guides)
2. Apply the annual ISR bracket schedule to the projected annual figure.
3. Divide the resulting annual ISR by **12** to obtain the monthly amount to withhold.
4. Withheld ISR is remitted to DGI **monthly, by the 15th of the following month**. `[RESEARCH GAP — the 15th-of-following-month remittance date is from secondary payroll sources (neeyamo, playroll), not a primary DGI page — reviewer to confirm]`

> Note: the décimo is included in the **annualisation factor (×13)** for projecting the ISR base, but the décimo payment itself has special SS treatment (Section 8) and its own ISR treatment where the worker's income level is taxable.

### Section 2.1 -- Individual filing (context)

- Tax year = **calendar year**. An employee with a **single salary source already withheld by the employer is generally exempt from filing**. Others file by **15 March** of the following year; estimated tax (for filers) is due in 3 installments — **30 June, 30 September, 31 December**. (PwC *Tax administration*)
- The employer provides each employee an annual **Form 03 (Comprobante de Ingresos)** and files an annual employer information return (**planilla 03**) of salaries/withholdings, due **31 March** of the following year. (PwC *Tax administration*)

### Section 2.2 -- Key personal deductions (relevant only if the employee files)

These reduce the taxable base on an employee's own return; they are not normally applied in routine employer monthly withholding. Source: PwC *Panama — Individual — Deductions*.

| Deduction | Limit (B/.) |
|---|---|
| Married-couple personal exemption | 800 |
| Mortgage interest (Panama home) | up to 15,000/yr |
| Retirement contributions | up to 15,000 |
| Education expenses (since Jan 2019) | up to 3,600 per student |
| Charitable donations | up to 50,000/yr |
| Medical expenses (incurred in Panama, documented) | deductible |

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (CSS, from 1 Apr 2025)

Employee contributions are withheld from gross salary and remitted to CSS via SIPE. Rates below are **current**, effective **1 April 2025** under **Ley No. 462 de 18 marzo 2025**. Source: PwC *Other taxes*; Fabrega Molino *Panama Social Security Reform 2025*.

| Contribution | Employee rate | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Social security (Seguro Social, CSS) | 9.75% | **none** |
| Educational insurance (Seguro Educativo) | 1.25% | **none** |
| **TOTAL employee deduction** | **11.00%** | **none** |

Sum check: 9.75 + 1.25 = **11.00%**. ✔

- **No wage ceiling / cap** on CSS or educational insurance — "no maximum limit on the taxable amount" (PwC).
- The internal split of the 9.75% between health (Enfermedad y Maternidad) and pension (IVM) was **not** obtainable from a primary CSS page. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the health/pension split of the 9.75% employee rate]`

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions (CSS, from 1 Apr 2025)

Employer contributions are paid on top of gross salary and remitted via SIPE. Source: PwC *Other taxes*; Fabrega Molino on Law 462.

| Contribution | Employer rate | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Social security (Seguro Social, CSS) | 13.25% (from 1 Apr 2025) | **none** |
| Educational insurance (Seguro Educativo) | 1.50% | **none** |
| **Subtotal (CSS + educational)** | **14.75%** | **none** |
| Professional risk (Riesgos Profesionales) | 0.33% – 6.25% (by industry risk class) | n/a |

Sum check (CSS + educational): 13.25 + 1.50 = **14.75%**. ✔ The riesgos-profesionales rate is **additional** to the 14.75% and varies by occupational risk class.

> `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm: the riesgos-profesionales 0.33%–6.25% band is from a single secondary guide (allaboutpanamacity); the exact rate-by-industry-class table could not be confirmed on an official CSS page. Obtain the company-specific rate from CSS before relying on it.]`

### Section 4.1 -- Employer CSS rate phase-in (Law 462)

The **employer** CSS rate rises on a statutory schedule under Law 462 (the educational-insurance and employee rates do **not** change on this schedule). Source: Fabrega Molino; MEF reform summary.

| Period | Employer CSS rate | Employer subtotal (CSS + 1.50% educational) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Apr 2025 – 28 Feb 2027 | 13.25% | 14.75% |
| from 1 Mar 2027 | 14.25% | 15.75% |

The minimum wage is set by **Executive Decree No. 13 of 31 Dec 2025**, published 6 Jan 2026 (Gaceta Oficial No. 30438), **effective 16 January 2026** (replacing Decree No. 01 of 10 Jan 2024). Rates are set **per hour**, differentiated by **economic activity, occupation, company size, and region** — **59 rates across 74 activities**. Source: EY *Panamá — salario mínimo 2026*; MITRADEL press release.

**Two regions:**
- **Region 1** — Panama City, San Miguelito, Colón, David, Santiago, Chitré, Penonomé, Aguadulce, La Chorrera, Arraiján, Boquete, Bugaba, Changuinola + listed districts in Herrera, Los Santos, Tierras Altas.

## Section 8 -- Statutory Pay Items

### Section 8.1 -- Décimo Tercer Mes (13th-Month Bonus) -- Mandatory

Legal basis: **Cabinet Decree No. 221 of 18 Nov 1971**, regulated by Decree No. 19 of 7 Sept 1973. Source: allaboutpanamacity; PKF Panamá / Laboremia (secondary).

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Amount | 1 day's salary per 11 days worked in the preceding 4-month period (≈ one month's salary per year total) |
| Payment schedule | 3 installments: **15 April, 15 August, 15 December** |
| Social-security treatment | SS deducted at a **reduced 7.25%** (vs the regular 9.75%) `[RESEARCH GAP — the 7.25% décimo SS rate is widely cited in secondary sources but could not be pulled from a primary CSS page — reviewer to confirm]` |
| ISR treatment | ISR withholding applies to the décimo where the worker's annual income level is taxable |
| Garnishment | Cannot be garnished |

---

## Section 9 -- Conservative Defaults

When inputs are ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag for the reviewer:

1. **ISR base is GROSS Panamanian-source salary, projected ×13.** Project annual income = monthly × 13, apply brackets, divide by 12. Do not pre-deduct CSS from the ISR base unless the reviewer confirms a net-of-CSS treatment. (PwC)
2. **Employee deduction = 11.00%** (CSS 9.75% + educational 1.25%), **no ceiling**, on every pay period. (PwC / Fabrega Molino)
3. **Employer subtotal = 14.75%** (CSS 13.25% + educational 1.50%) for periods up to 28 Feb 2027; switch to 15.75% from 1 Mar 2027, 16.75% from 1 Mar 2029. (Law 462)
4. **Riesgos profesionales is a SEPARATE employer cost** (0.33%–6.25% by class) on top of the 14.75% subtotal — never fold it in. Default to the lowest band only as an illustrative placeholder and flag. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
5. **Minimum wage is per activity/size/region.** Never assume a single national floor — use the MITRADEL Decree 13 annex cell matching the role. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
6. **Décimo SS at 7.25%, not 9.75%,** and ISR on the décimo only where the worker is taxable. (secondary) `[RESEARCH GAP]`
7. **USD = balboa 1:1** — present figures in B/.; USD amounts are numerically identical.

## Section 10 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Employee gross monthly remuneration (B/.) | Base for both ISR (×13 projection) and CSS |
| Pay-period date | Determines employer CSS rate (13.25% vs 14.25% from 1 Mar 2027) |
| Single vs multiple income sources | Determines whether monthly withholding is final (filing exemption) |
| Whether the remuneration is Panamanian-source | Territorial system — foreign-source salary is not taxed |
| Occupational activity, company size, region | Minimum-wage compliance check |
| Company occupational risk class | Riesgos-profesionales rate (0.33%–6.25%) |
| Employer CSS registration status + new-hire registration | Compliance / SIPE filing obligation |

### Refusal Catalogue — DO NOT proceed (refuse and request the missing item) if:

- Gross monthly remuneration is not provided or is below the applicable minimum-wage cell (flag a minimum-wage breach).
- It is unclear whether the salary is **Panamanian-source** (territorial system — refuse to tax foreign-source income without confirmation).
- The employer is not registered with CSS — payroll cannot be lawfully run via SIPE.
- A net-pay target is given and you are asked to "gross up" without confirming the ISR base (gross vs net of CSS) — flag the RESEARCH GAP.
- A décimo is requested with the regular 9.75% SS rate instead of the reduced 7.25% — flag for confirmation.
- The pay period falls on/after a phase-in boundary (1 Mar 2027 / 1 Mar 2029) without clarification of which employer CSS rate applies.

## Section 12 -- Worked Examples

All examples use current rates: ISR brackets 0 / 15 / 25% (edges 11,000 / 50,000); ISR base = monthly × 13 projected annual, ÷ 12 monthly; employee CSS+educational 11.00%; employer subtotal 14.75% (CSS 13.25% + educational 1.50%). Riesgos profesionales shown illustratively at the low end and flagged. Figures recomputed end-to-end (B/. = USD).

### Example A -- Below ISR threshold

- Gross monthly: B/.800. Single Panamanian-source salary.
- Projected annual = 800 × 13 = 10,400 ≤ 11,000 → annual ISR **B/.0** → monthly ISR **B/.0**.
- Employee CSS + educational: 800 × 11.00% = **B/.88.00**.
- **Net pay = 800 − 0 − 88.00 = B/.712.00.**
- Employer cost: 800 × 14.75% = B/.118.00 (+ riesgos profesionales by class, e.g. ~B/.2.64 at 0.33%).
- Bank line: `DEPOSITO SALARIO XYZ SA B/.712.00`.

### Example B -- Mid-band, single source

- Gross monthly: B/.1,500.
- Projected annual = 1,500 × 13 = 19,500. Annual ISR = 15% × (19,500 − 11,000) = 15% × 8,500 = 1,275 → monthly ISR = 1,275 ÷ 12 = **B/.106.25**.
- Employee CSS + educational: 1,500 × 11.00% = **B/.165.00**.
- **Net pay = 1,500 − 106.25 − 165.00 = B/.1,228.75.**
- Employer cost: 1,500 × 14.75% = B/.221.25 (+ riesgos profesionales).

### Example C -- Top of 15% projection band

- Gross monthly: B/.3,000.
- Projected annual = 3,000 × 13 = 39,000. Annual ISR = 15% × (39,000 − 11,000) = 15% × 28,000 = 4,200 → monthly ISR = 4,200 ÷ 12 = **B/.350.00**.
- Employee CSS + educational: 3,000 × 11.00% = **B/.330.00**.
- **Net pay = 3,000 − 350.00 − 330.00 = B/.2,320.00.**
- Employer cost: 3,000 × 14.75% = B/.442.50 (+ riesgos profesionales).

### Example D -- Into the 25% band

- Gross monthly: B/.5,000.
- Projected annual = 5,000 × 13 = 65,000. Annual ISR = 5,850 + 25% × (65,000 − 50,000) = 5,850 + 25% × 15,000 = 5,850 + 3,750 = 9,600 → monthly ISR = 9,600 ÷ 12 = **B/.800.00**.
- Employee CSS + educational: 5,000 × 11.00% = **B/.550.00**.
- **Net pay = 5,000 − 800.00 − 550.00 = B/.3,650.00.**
- Employer cost: 5,000 × 14.75% = B/.737.50 (+ riesgos profesionales).

### Example E -- High earner, top band

- Gross monthly: B/.10,000.
- Projected annual = 10,000 × 13 = 130,000. Annual ISR = 5,850 + 25% × (130,000 − 50,000) = 5,850 + 25% × 80,000 = 5,850 + 20,000 = 25,850 → monthly ISR = 25,850 ÷ 12 = **B/.2,154.17** (rounded).
- Employee CSS + educational: 10,000 × 11.00% = **B/.1,100.00**.
- **Net pay = 10,000 − 2,154.17 − 1,100.00 = B/.6,745.83.**
- Employer cost: 10,000 × 14.75% = B/.1,475.00 (+ riesgos profesionales).

### Example F -- Décimo Tercer Mes installment

- Employee earns B/.3,000/month, full year. Annual décimo ≈ one month's salary = **B/.3,000**, paid in three installments (15 Apr / 15 Aug / 15 Dec).
- SS deducted at the reduced **7.25%**: 3,000 × 7.25% = B/.217.50. `[RESEARCH GAP — 7.25% rate from secondary sources]`
- Net décimo before ISR = 3,000 − 217.50 = **B/.2,782.50** (ISR additionally applies where the worker's income level is taxable).
- Bank line: `DECIMO TERCER MES B/.2,782.50` (split across three installments in practice).

## Section 13 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply automatically)

1. Project ISR base = monthly gross (Panamanian-source) × **13**; apply annual brackets 0% / 15% / 25% with edges B/.11,000 / B/.50,000; divide annual ISR by 12 for the monthly amount. (DGI *Tarifa* / PwC)
2. Cumulative ISR at B/.50,000 = **B/.5,850**; above B/.50,000, ISR = 5,850 + 25% × (annual − 50,000).
3. ISR withheld monthly is the employee's **final** tax if there is a single salary source — no annual return required.
4. Withhold employee **CSS + educational = 11.00%** of gross (9.75% + 1.25%); **no ceiling**. (PwC / Fabrega Molino)
5. Compute employer **CSS + educational = 14.75%** of gross (13.25% + 1.50%) for periods up to 28 Feb 2027; **15.75%** from 1 Mar 2027; **16.75%** from 1 Mar 2029. (Law 462)
6. Add the **separate** riesgos-profesionales employer cost (0.33%–6.25% by class) — never fold it into the CSS subtotal. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
7. Décimo = ≈ one month's salary, paid in 3 installments (15 Apr / 15 Aug / 15 Dec); SS at the reduced **7.25%**; ISR where taxable; cannot be garnished. `[RESEARCH GAP on 7.25%]`
8. Remit ISR to DGI **monthly by the 15th** of the following month. `[RESEARCH GAP on date]`
9. File the CSS planilla via **SIPE before the 21st** of the month; pay within the following month; register each new hire with CSS within ~**5 working days** of hire. `[RESEARCH GAP — SIPE timing from secondary sources]`
10. Issue each employee **Form 03 (Comprobante de Ingresos)** and file the annual employer return (**planilla 03**) by **31 March** of the following year. (PwC)

---

## Section 14 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items require a Panamanian accountant's judgement and are flagged rather than auto-computed:

1. **ISR base (gross vs net of CSS).** Conservative default is gross-Panamanian-source projected ×13; confirm no pre-deduction of CSS applies. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`
2. **Riesgos-profesionales rate.** 0.33%–6.25% by occupational class; the exact rate table by industry is from a single secondary source and must be confirmed with CSS. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
3. **Health/pension split of the 9.75% employee rate.** Not obtainable from a primary CSS page. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
4. **Décimo SS rate (7.25%).** Widely cited but not pulled from a primary CSS page. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
5. **Late-payment penalty / surcharge formulas (CSS and DGI).** Exact percentages not found on an authoritative page. `[RESEARCH GAP]`
6. **Minimum-wage cell.** The precise per-activity/size/region rate from the Decree 13 annex (59 rates). `[RESEARCH GAP]`
7. **Territoriality edge cases.** Whether a specific component of remuneration is Panamanian-source (e.g. work partly performed abroad).
8. **Personal-return deductions.** Mortgage / education / retirement / donation deductions affect the employee's own return, not routine employer withholding.

## Section 17 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you cannot identify the correct figures for a specific employee or period:

1. Confirm the **pay-period date** to select the employer CSS rate (13.25% to 28 Feb 2027; 14.25% from 1 Mar 2027).
2. Confirm the salary is **Panamanian-source** (territorial system) before applying ISR.
3. Confirm **single vs multiple income sources** to decide if monthly withholding is final.
4. If the employer's **CSS registration** status is unknown, treat the engagement as blocked until registration is confirmed.
5. If the **riesgos-profesionales risk class** is unknown, use the 0.33% low band only as an illustrative placeholder and flag it as `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`.
6. If the **ISR base treatment** is contested, default to gross-Panamanian-source projected ×13 and flag for the Panamanian accountant.
7. Always present output as **estimated** and route to a Contador Público Autorizado for sign-off.

Source: PwC *Tax administration* (planilla 03, Form 03); SIPE timing and registration windows from secondary payroll providers (neeyamo, papayaglobal).

### Penalties

| Penalty | Detail |
|---|---|
| Late CSS payment | Surcharges + interest assessed by CSS `[RESEARCH GAP — exact formula not on a primary page]` |

### Test Suite (recompute and assert — figures verified end-to-end)

1. **Gross B/.800 →** projected annual 10,400 ≤ 11,000; ISR B/.0; employee CSS B/.88.00; **net B/.712.00**.
2. **Gross B/.1,500 →** projected annual 19,500; annual ISR B/.1,275; monthly ISR B/.106.25; CSS B/.165.00; **net B/.1,228.75**.
3. **Gross B/.3,000 →** projected annual 39,000; annual ISR B/.4,200; monthly ISR B/.350.00; CSS B/.330.00; **net B/.2,320.00**.
4. **Gross B/.5,000 →** projected annual 65,000; annual ISR B/.9,600; monthly ISR B/.800.00; CSS B/.550.00; **net B/.3,650.00**.
5. **Gross B/.10,000 →** projected annual 130,000; annual ISR B/.25,850; monthly ISR B/.2,154.17; CSS B/.1,100.00; **net B/.6,745.83**.
6. **Cumulative-ISR assertion:** annual ISR at B/.50,000 = 15% × (50,000 − 11,000) = **B/.5,850**.
7. **Employee-deduction assertion:** 9.75% + 1.25% = **11.00%**, no ceiling.
8. **Employer-subtotal assertion:** 13.25% + 1.50% = **14.75%** (to 28 Feb 2027); 14.25% + 1.50% = 15.75% (from 1 Mar 2027).
9. **Employer-cost assertion:** gross B/.3,000 → employer CSS+educational 14.75% = **B/.442.50** (+ riesgos profesionales by class).
10. **Décimo assertion:** B/.3,000 décimo → SS 7.25% = B/.217.50; net before ISR = **B/.2,782.50**; paid 15 Apr / 15 Aug / 15 Dec. `[RESEARCH GAP on 7.25%]`

## Section 20 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (ISR + CSS) | **This skill (panama-payroll.md)** |
| ITBMS (VAT) returns | panama-itbms.md |
| Corporate income tax | panama-corporate-tax.md (if available) |
| Bookkeeping | panama-bookkeeping.md (if available) |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages, employer CSS + educational, and riesgos profesionales are expenses; employee CSS + educational and ISR withheld are liabilities until remitted to CSS/DGI.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** Single-source monthly ISR withholding is final; multi-source employees must file by 15 March of the following year.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER run payroll for an employer that is not registered with CSS — SIPE filing requires registration.
- NEVER tax foreign-source salary — Panama is territorial; only Panamanian-source income is taxed.
- NEVER fold the riesgos-profesionales cost into the 14.75% CSS subtotal — it is a separate employer policy (0.33%–6.25% by class).
- NEVER apply a wage ceiling to CSS or educational insurance — there is no maximum contributory base.
- NEVER withhold the regular 9.75% SS on the décimo — it uses the reduced 7.25% rate (flag the `[RESEARCH GAP]`).
- NEVER omit the ×13 annualisation when projecting the ISR base.
- NEVER assume a single national minimum wage — use the MITRADEL Decree 13 cell for activity/size/region.
- NEVER use the outdated "12.25%" retroactive employer figure — the current rate is 13.25%.
- NEVER use 2027/2029 employer CSS rates for periods before their phase-in dates, or current rates after.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Panamanian Contador Público Autorizado.
