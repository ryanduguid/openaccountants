# Bolivia Tax Optimization

## Bolivia Tax Optimization Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Sources: Servicio de Impuestos Nacionales (SIN/Impuestos.gob.bo), PwC Bolivia. Figures must agree with `bolivia-income-tax.md` / `bolivia-social-contributions.md`. NOT yet signed off by a Bolivian tax adviser. Aggressive positions are never advised; every suggestion must be reviewed.**

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Plurinational State of Bolivia |
| Currency | BOB (boliviano, Bs) |
| Headline levers | Régimen Tributario Simplificado (RTS) for tiny traders; otherwise the general regime |
| General regime | IUE 25% (corporate); IVA 13%; IT 3%; RC-IVA 13% (complementary on individuals) |
| Anti-avoidance | RTS activity/capital limits; substance |

> **Bolivia's small-trader lever is the RTS** — a fixed bimonthly fee based on **capital**, not income, for retail/food/artisan activity. It is very narrow; most service businesses fall under the general regime (IUE 25%).

## Section 2 -- Régimen Tributario Simplificado (RTS)

**Régimen Tributario Simplificado (RTS)**

| Feature | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Who | Natural persons in **retail commerce, food sales (vivanderos), artisans** only |
| Capital limit | Bs 60,000 (capital ≤ Bs 12,000 with sales < Bs 184,000 → no registration needed) |
| Tax | A **fixed bimonthly fee (Bs 47–200)** by category (assigned on declared capital); no invoices issued |

The RTS is a flat, predictable micro-fee — but excludes most professional/service activity. (SIN; impuestos.gob.bo)

## Section 3 -- General Regime (most businesses)

**General Regime rates**

| Tax | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| IUE (corporate income tax) | 25% |
| IVA (VAT) | 13% |
| IT (transactions tax) | 3% |
| RC-IVA (complementary, individuals) | 13% — offsettable with VAT on personal purchase invoices |

**Optimisation under the general regime is mostly about (a) collecting VAT-bearing purchase invoices to offset RC-IVA/IVA, and (b) genuine deductible expenses against IUE.** **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm any SME incentives and the dividend treatment.]**

## Section 4 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **RTS eligibility narrowness** — RTS eligibility is narrow (activity + capital limits) — don't place service/professional activity there. AUDIT FLASH POINT.
- **Genuine VAT invoices only** — Keep genuine VAT purchase invoices to offset RC-IVA — but never use fake invoices (a known enforcement focus).
- **Substance requirement** — Substance for any structure.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **RTS misuse for service/professional activity** — NEVER present the RTS for service/professional activity (retail/food/artisan only).
- **Fabricated invoices** — NEVER use fabricated purchase invoices to offset RC-IVA/IVA.
- **Rate consistency** — NEVER contradict the rates in `bolivia-income-tax.md` / `bolivia-social-contributions.md`.
- **Research gap disclosure** — NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Bolivian tax adviser.
