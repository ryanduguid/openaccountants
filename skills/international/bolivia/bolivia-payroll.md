# Bolivia Payroll Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 (research-verified).** The RC-IVA 13% flat rate, the employee Aporte Laboral (12.71%: 10% vejez + 1.71% riesgo comun + 0.50% comision Gestora + 0.50% aporte solidario), the 60-SMN pension cap, the Aporte Nacional Solidario brackets (1.15% / 5.74% / 11.48% above Bs 13,000 / Bs 25,000 / Bs 35,000) and the employer Aporte Patronal (17.21% general / 19.51% mining) are taken from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Bolivia) and corroborated by Bolivian payroll/advisory guides (Planifica, Bolivia Impuestos, TopTrabajos). The flat 13% RC-IVA and the agente-de-retencion mechanism rest on Ley N° 843 (Arts. 19-36) and DS 21531; the ANS brackets and the 3.5% Aporte Patronal Solidario rest on Ley N° 1582 (1 Oct 2024). The 2025 SMN (Bs 2,750) is from DS 5383 (1 May 2025); the 2026 SMN (Bs 3,300) is from DS 5516 (Jan 2026). **Several official SIN/SIAT and MEFP pages repeatedly failed TLS verification or returned 403 in the research environment, so secondary (Big-4 / Bolivian advisory) sources were relied upon and must be re-verified against the authority before publication.** Figures carry **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** markers where the primary authority figure could not be pinned to a single fixed published value (notably the exact DS 5383 presumed-VAT-credit change, the aguinaldo RC-IVA treatment, and whether the ANS is deductible from the RC-IVA base). Confidence: **medium**.

The RC-IVA base is computed on **total ganado less the deductible employee pension contributions less 2 SMN less VAT credits** (Section 2).

---

## Section 2 -- Personal Income Tax Withholding (RC-IVA, the agente-de-retencion mechanism)

Bolivia **does** have a personal income tax for salaried workers: the **Regimen Complementario al IVA (RC-IVA)**, a **flat 13%** levied on individuals' income (Ley N° 843, Arts. 19-36). For **dependent employees** the employer is the **agente de retencion** — it computes and withholds RC-IVA monthly, files a consolidated planilla tributaria, and remits via **Form 608**. There is **no joint filing**; married couples file separately. (Sources: Ley 843; DS 21531; PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries.)

### RC-IVA Computation Method (dependent employees, monthly)

1. Start from **total ganado** (gross monthly earnings).
2. Subtract the **deductible employee pension contributions (Aporte Laboral, 12.71%)** — Section 3.
3. Subtract the **non-taxable minimum = 2 SMN/month** (Bs 5,500 in 2025; Bs 6,600 in 2026).
4. Apply **13%** to the remaining base → **gross RC-IVA**.
5. Offset against the gross RC-IVA the employee's **VAT credit**: (a) the **presumed VAT-credit allowance**, plus (b) **13% of the VAT on invoices (facturas)** the employee submits via **Form 110**.
6. The **net** of step 5 (if positive) is the RC-IVA **withheld**; if the credit exceeds the gross RC-IVA, no RC-IVA is withheld and the surplus credit carries forward as a saldo a favor del dependiente.

**Non-taxable minimum (paso 3):** 2 SMN/month = **Bs 5,500 in 2025** (2 x Bs 2,750) and **Bs 6,600 in 2026** (2 x Bs 3,300). (Ley 843; DS 5383; DS 5516.)

**Presumed VAT credit (paso 5a):** historically the presumed credit equalled **13% of 2 SMN**, which together with the 2-SMN minimum made the effective RC-IVA exemption roughly **4 SMN of gross salary**. **DS 5383 (1 May 2025) reportedly reduced the presumed-credit reference from 2 SMN to 1 SMN**, lowering the threshold so workers earning above ~Bs 9,400/month may owe RC-IVA unless they submit enough invoices. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact wording of DS 5383 on the presumed VAT-credit allowance against the decree itself; multiple advisory sources report the 2-SMN→1-SMN reduction but it was not confirmed from the Gaceta Oficial.]** (Sources: advisory summaries — Rigoberto Paredes; Bolivia Impuestos.)

> **Conservative default:** until DS 5383 is confirmed, use the **higher** RC-IVA liability (presumed credit = 13% of **1 SMN**) for affected mid-earners and flag for the reviewer.

### Flat rate

| Tax | Type | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| RC-IVA (personal income tax) | Flat | **13%** | Total ganado − employee pension contributions (12.71%) − 2 SMN minimum − VAT credits (presumed + submitted facturas). (Ley 843, Arts. 19-36.) |

There is no progressive scale: RC-IVA is a single 13% rate. The exemption is delivered through the 2-SMN minimum and the VAT-credit offset, **not** a 0% band, so for most low/mid earners the effective RC-IVA is **nil** once the minimum and presumed credit are applied. (PwC; Ley 843.)

### Direct / independent RC-IVA taxpayers

Non-dependent persons (e.g. directors' fees, rental income, salaried individuals paid by a foreign employer) are **contribuyentes directos** and self-declare RC-IVA on **Form 610** rather than being withheld through payroll. Route these out of the dependent-payroll flow (R-BO-P-2). (SIAT; SIN.)

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (Aporte Laboral)

The employee bears the **pension-side** contributions (collected by the **Gestora Publica**) plus, for higher earners, the **Aporte Nacional Solidario**. Health (CNS) is **employer-only** (Section 4). All are computed on **total ganado** (gross). (Sources: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries; Planifica; TopTrabajos; Ley 065; Ley 1582.)

### Employee Contribution Rates (2025)

| Contribution (Spanish) | Rate | Base | Destination / Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aporte de Vejez (old-age pension) | 10.00% | Total ganado (capped at 60 SMN) | Individual pension account — Gestora Publica (PwC; Ley 065) |
| Prima de Riesgo Comun (disability/death) | 1.71% | Total ganado (capped at 60 SMN) | Gestora Publica (PwC) |
| Comision de administracion (Gestora) | 0.50% | Total ganado | Gestora Publica admin fee (PwC; Planifica) |
| Aporte Solidario del Asegurado | 0.50% | Total ganado | Fondo Solidario / Pension Solidaria de Vejez (PwC; Planifica) |
| **TOTAL employee pension-side (Aporte Laboral)** | **12.71%** | Total ganado | = 10.00 + 1.71 + 0.50 + 0.50; **deductible from the RC-IVA base** (PwC) |

Arithmetic check: 10.00 + 1.71 + 0.50 + 0.50 = **12.71%**. ✓

### Aporte Nacional Solidario (ANS) -- employee, post-Ley 1582 (effective 1 Oct 2024)

The ANS applies **only** to **total ganado above Bs 13,000/month**, with **cumulative marginal** rates (the rates stack on each successive slice). Pre-Ley 1582 the rates were 1% / 5% / 10%; Ley 1582 raised them. (Sources: Ley N° 1582; MEFP; Bolivia Impuestos.)

| Slice of total ganado | Marginal rate applied to the slice | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Portion from Bs 13,000.01 to Bs 25,000 | **1.15%** | Ley 1582; MEFP |
| Portion from Bs 25,000.01 to Bs 35,000 | **1.15% + 5.74% = 6.89%** | Ley 1582; MEFP |
| Portion above Bs 35,000 | **1.15% + 5.74% + 11.48% = 18.37%** | Ley 1582; MEFP |

> **Computation:** the three rates are **additive on each band** (the standard Bolivian ANS method). Example for Bs 30,000: (25,000 − 13,000) x 1.15% + (30,000 − 25,000) x 6.89% = 138.00 + 344.50 = **Bs 482.50**. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the precise marginal-vs-stacked computation with a worked example against the MEFP/SIN; the data describes the rates as cumulative marginal across Bs 13,000 / 25,000 / 35,000.]**

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the ANS is deductible from the RC-IVA base.]** The 12.71% Aporte Laboral is confirmed deductible (PwC); the worked examples below treat the ANS as a further deductible employee social contribution but flag it for the reviewer.

### Pension contribution ceiling (tope)

Pension (vejez and riesgo comun) contributions are levied up to a cap of **60 SMN per month** = **Bs 165,000 in 2025** (60 x Bs 2,750) and **Bs 198,000 in 2026** (60 x Bs 3,300). PwC cites the cap as ~USD 28,450. (Sources: PwC; Ley 065.) **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the 0.50% comision, the 0.50% aporte solidario and the ANS are also subject to the 60-SMN cap or computed on uncapped total ganado.]**

---

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions (Aporte Patronal)

The employer pays the **short-term health** contribution (CNS), the **work-accident** branch, the **housing** fund and the **Aporte Patronal Solidario** — all employer-only, all on **total ganado**. The employer does **not** pay RC-IVA (it only withholds it) and does **not** pay the employee pension branches. (Sources: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Corporate, Other taxes; Planifica; Ley 1582.)

### Employer Contribution Rates (2025)

| Contribution (Spanish) | Rate | Base | Destination / Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Caja Nacional de Salud (CNS) — short-term health | 10.00% | Total ganado | CNS (or chosen Caja) (PwC; Planifica) |
| Riesgo Profesional (work-accident) | 1.71% | Total ganado | Gestora Publica (PwC) |
| Aporte Patronal Pro-Vivienda (FONVIS / housing) | 2.00% | Total ganado | Housing fund (PwC; Planifica) |
| Aporte Patronal Solidario (APS) | 3.50% | Total ganado | Raised from 3.00% to 3.50% by Ley 1582 (eff. 1 Oct 2024) (Ley 1582; PwC) |
| **TOTAL employer social (Aporte Patronal) — general** | **17.21%** | Total ganado | = 10.00 + 1.71 + 2.00 + 3.50 (PwC) |
| **TOTAL employer social (Aporte Patronal) — mining** | **19.51%** | Total ganado | General 17.21% + ~2.30% mining (PwC) |

Arithmetic check (general): 10.00 + 1.71 + 2.00 + 3.50 = **17.21%**. ✓ Mining: 17.21 + 2.30 = **19.51%**. ✓

> The employer total moved from **16.71%** (3.00% APS) to **17.21%** (3.50% APS) under Ley 1582. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact effective date for payroll application of the 3.5% APS; some Bolivian payroll guides still quote 16.71%. 17.21% reflects the current 3.5% APS and is the figure used here.]**

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage (SMN), Statutory Bonuses and Reference Items

### Salario Minimo Nacional (SMN) -- full-time monthly

| Year | SMN/month | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2025 | **Bs 2,750** | DS 5383 (1 May 2025; +10% vs Bs 2,500; basic-salary haber increase 5%, retroactive to 1 Jan 2025) (DS 5383 / Lexivox) |
| 2026 | **Bs 3,300** | DS 5516 (published 13 Jan 2026; +20%, retroactive to 1 Jan 2026) (DS 5516; secondary sources) |

The SMN drives **both** the RC-IVA non-taxable minimum (2 SMN) and the pension cap (60 SMN), so figures **must** be updated annually with each salary decree. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2026 SMN Bs 3,300 against the Gaceta Oficial; it is reported consistently by multiple secondary sources.]**

### Statutory Bonuses and Benefits

| Item (Spanish) | Detail | RC-IVA treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Aguinaldo (Christmas bonus) | Mandatory 13th-month salary (1 monthly salary), payable by ~20 December (Ministerio de Trabajo) | **[RESEARCH GAP — conflicting sources.]** PwC: all bonuses **except** the Christmas bonus are taxed (implying the aguinaldo de Navidad is RC-IVA-exempt per DS 21531); some Bolivian sources list the aguinaldo as taxable. **Reconcile before finalizing.** |
| Segundo Aguinaldo ("Esfuerzo por Bolivia", DS 1802) | Second 13th-month payment, **only** mandatory if national GDP growth exceeds **4.5%** | Not RC-IVA taxed (DS 1802) |
| Indemnizacion (severance) | 1 month salary per year of service (pro-rata after 3 months) | **RC-IVA-exempt** (DS 21531) |
| Desahucio (unjustified-dismissal compensation) | 3 months salary | **RC-IVA-exempt** (DS 21531) |
| Prima anual | 1 month salary when the company has profits; employees with 3+ months service | **Taxable** for RC-IVA (Deel; advisory) |
| Vacaciones (annual leave) | 15 working days (1-5 yrs service), 20 (5-10 yrs), 30 (10+ yrs), paid 100% | Paid leave (Deel; Ministerio de Trabajo) |
| Working hours / overtime | Max 8h/day, 48h/week (daytime); overtime surcharge **100%**; max 2 extra hours/day | Labor rule (Ley General del Trabajo; Deel) |

---

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is ambiguous, apply the conservative default and flag for the reviewer rather than guessing.

| Ambiguity | Conservative Default |
|---|---|
| RC-IVA base | Treat RC-IVA as **13%** of (total ganado − 12.71% employee pension contributions − 2 SMN minimum − VAT credits). If invoice (factura) data is unavailable, assume **no VAT credit beyond the presumed allowance**, which maximizes the withholding. |
| DS 5383 presumed-credit change | Until the exact DS 5383 text is confirmed, conservatively assume the **higher** RC-IVA liability (presumed credit reduced to **1 SMN**, i.e. 13% x 1 SMN) for affected earners and flag for accountant review. Trigger R-BO-P-7. |
| Employer social cost | Use **17.21%** of total ganado for general employers (**19.51%** for mining). Add aguinaldo, an indemnizacion provision, and pro-vivienda when budgeting fully-loaded cost. |
| Aporte Nacional Solidario | Apply **only** if monthly total ganado exceeds **Bs 13,000**; compute **cumulatively** across the 1.15% / 6.89% / 18.37% effective bands (additive 1.15% + 5.74% + 11.48%). |
| ANS deductibility | Treat the ANS as a deductible employee social contribution for the RC-IVA base, but **flag** — confirm with the reviewer (R-BO-P-8). |
| Pension cap | Apply the **60-SMN** cap (Bs 165,000/month in 2025; Bs 198,000 in 2026) to vejez and riesgo comun; flag whether comision/aporte solidario/ANS are also capped. |
| SMN / year | Use **Bs 2,750** for 2025 pay periods and **Bs 3,300** for 2026 pay periods; never mix. The SMN drives the 2-SMN minimum and the 60-SMN cap. |
| Aguinaldo RC-IVA | Treat the **Christmas aguinaldo** as RC-IVA-exempt (PwC view) but **flag** the conflicting Bolivian-source view; treat indemnizacion and desahucio as RC-IVA-exempt (DS 21531). |
| Currency | All amounts in **BOB (Bs)**. Do not convert to USD in computations. |

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — for each employee: **total ganado** (gross monthly earnings), pay period, the employer's **NIT** (Numero de Identificacion Tributaria), and the year (for the SMN). Whether the worker is a **dependent** employee (vs contribuyente directo).

**Recommended** — the employee's **Form 110 invoice (factura) total** for the month (to compute the VAT credit), the **last digit of the employer's NIT** (for the Form 608 due date), whether the employer is **mining** (19.51% vs 17.21%), date of hire (for aguinaldo/indemnizacion pro-rata), and any bonuses/prima.

**Ideal** — the full **planilla tributaria** and **planilla de aportes** (Gestora/CNS), prior Form 608 filings, prior-month cumulative RC-IVA saldos a favor del dependiente, and the employee's pension/CNS registration.

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All figures use the **2025** parameter set unless stated: **SMN Bs 2,750**; 2-SMN RC-IVA minimum **Bs 5,500**; 60-SMN pension cap **Bs 165,000/month**; presumed VAT credit conservatively **13% x 1 SMN = Bs 357.50** (DS 5383 conservative default). RC-IVA shown assumes the employee submits **no facturas** via Form 110 (the conservative, maximum-withholding case). Employer on-cost uses **17.21%** (general). All amounts in BOB (Bs). Withholding is **illustrative** — a Bolivian reviewer must confirm the DS 5383 presumed-credit and the aguinaldo/ANS treatment.

### Example 1 — Minimum-wage employee (Bs 2,750/month, 2025)

**Bank statement line (employer debit):**
`30/06/2025 ; PLANILLA SUELDOS - J. MAMANI ; DEBITO ; Sueldo junio ; -2.400,47 ; Bs`

**Reasoning:**
Total ganado Bs 2,750. Employee pension (Aporte Laboral) 12.71% x 2,750 = **Bs 349.53**. RC-IVA base = 2,750 − 349.53 − 5,500 (2 SMN) = **negative** → RC-IVA = **Bs 0**. ANS: 2,750 < 13,000 → **Bs 0**. Net = 2,750 − 349.53 = **Bs 2,400.47**.

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total ganado | -- | -- | 2,750.00 |
| Employee Aporte Laboral | 2,750.00 | 12.71% | 349.53 |
| RC-IVA (base ≤ 0) | -- | 13% | 0.00 |
| ANS (below Bs 13,000) | -- | -- | 0.00 |
| **Net pay** | -- | -- | **2,400.47** |
| Employer Aporte Patronal | 2,750.00 | 17.21% | 473.28 |

### Example 2 — Low earner, RC-IVA still nil (Bs 8,000/month, 2025, no facturas)

**Bank statement line (employee credit):**
`30/06/2025 ; EMPLEADOR SRL TRANSFERENCIA ; CREDITO ; Sueldo junio ; +6.983,20 ; Bs`

**Reasoning:**
Total ganado Bs 8,000. Aporte Laboral 12.71% x 8,000 = **Bs 1,016.80**. RC-IVA base = 8,000 − 1,016.80 − 5,500 = **Bs 1,483.20**; gross RC-IVA = 13% x 1,483.20 = **Bs 192.82**. Presumed VAT credit (Bs 357.50) **exceeds** the gross RC-IVA → RC-IVA withheld = **Bs 0**; surplus credit Bs 164.68 carries forward. ANS: 8,000 < 13,000 → Bs 0. Net = 8,000 − 1,016.80 = **Bs 6,983.20**.

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total ganado | -- | -- | 8,000.00 |
| Employee Aporte Laboral | 8,000.00 | 12.71% | 1,016.80 |
| RC-IVA base | -- | -- | 1,483.20 |
| Gross RC-IVA | 1,483.20 | 13% | 192.82 |
| Less presumed VAT credit | -- | -- | (357.50) |
| RC-IVA withheld (floored at 0) | -- | -- | 0.00 |
| **Net pay** | -- | -- | **6,983.20** |

### Example 3 — Mid earner, RC-IVA now due (Bs 12,000/month, 2025, no facturas)

**Bank statement line (employer debit, RC-IVA remittance):**
`16/07/2025 ; IMPUESTOS NACIONALES RC-IVA F608 ; DEBITO ; Retencion junio ; -289,22 ; Bs`

**Reasoning:**
Total ganado Bs 12,000. Aporte Laboral 12.71% x 12,000 = **Bs 1,525.20**. RC-IVA base = 12,000 − 1,525.20 − 5,500 = **Bs 4,974.80**; gross RC-IVA = 13% x 4,974.80 = **Bs 646.72**. Presumed VAT credit Bs 357.50 → RC-IVA withheld = 646.72 − 357.50 = **Bs 289.22** (employee submits no facturas; submitting facturas worth ≥ Bs 2,224 of VAT-inclusive purchases would extinguish it). ANS: 12,000 < 13,000 → Bs 0. Net = 12,000 − 1,525.20 − 289.22 = **Bs 10,185.58**.

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total ganado | -- | -- | 12,000.00 |
| Employee Aporte Laboral | 12,000.00 | 12.71% | 1,525.20 |
| RC-IVA base | -- | -- | 4,974.80 |
| Gross RC-IVA | 4,974.80 | 13% | 646.72 |
| Less presumed VAT credit | -- | -- | (357.50) |
| RC-IVA withheld | -- | -- | 289.22 |
| **Net pay** | -- | -- | **10,185.58** |
| Employer Aporte Patronal | 12,000.00 | 17.21% | 2,065.20 |

> Under the **historical** presumed credit (13% x 2 SMN = Bs 715.00) the gross RC-IVA Bs 646.72 would have been fully covered → Bs 0 withheld. This example shows why the DS 5383 change (R-BO-P-7) matters for mid-earners.

### Example 4 — High earner, ANS applies (Bs 30,000/month, 2025, no facturas)

**Bank statement line (employer debit, Gestora):**
`05/07/2025 ; GESTORA PUBLICA APORTE LABORAL ; DEBITO ; Aportes junio ; -4.295,50 ; Bs`

**Reasoning:**
Total ganado Bs 30,000 (below the 60-SMN cap Bs 165,000, so no cap effect). Aporte Laboral 12.71% x 30,000 = **Bs 3,813.00**. ANS (cumulative marginal): slice 13,000–25,000 = 12,000 x 1.15% = **138.00**; slice 25,000–30,000 = 5,000 x 6.89% = **344.50**; ANS = **Bs 482.50**. Total employee social = 3,813.00 + 482.50 = **Bs 4,295.50**. RC-IVA base = 30,000 − 4,295.50 − 5,500 = **Bs 20,204.50**; gross RC-IVA = 13% x 20,204.50 = **Bs 2,626.59**; less presumed credit Bs 357.50 → RC-IVA withheld = **Bs 2,269.09**. Net = 30,000 − 4,295.50 − 2,269.09 = **Bs 23,435.41**.

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total ganado | -- | -- | 30,000.00 |
| Employee Aporte Laboral | 30,000.00 | 12.71% | 3,813.00 |
| ANS (13k–25k @ 1.15% + 25k–30k @ 6.89%) | -- | marginal | 482.50 |
| RC-IVA base (after social + 2 SMN) | -- | -- | 20,204.50 |
| Gross RC-IVA | 20,204.50 | 13% | 2,626.59 |
| Less presumed VAT credit | -- | -- | (357.50) |
| RC-IVA withheld | -- | -- | 2,269.09 |
| **Net pay** | -- | -- | **23,435.41** |
| Employer Aporte Patronal | 30,000.00 | 17.21% | 5,163.00 |

> **[RESEARCH GAP]** This example treats the ANS as deductible from the RC-IVA base (R-BO-P-8). If the ANS is **not** deductible, the RC-IVA base would be 30,000 − 3,813.00 − 5,500 = 20,687.00 and gross RC-IVA = Bs 2,689.31 (withheld 2,331.81). Reviewer to confirm.

### Example 5 — Pension cap binds (Bs 200,000/month, 2025)

**Reasoning:**
Total ganado Bs 200,000 exceeds the 60-SMN pension cap **Bs 165,000** (60 x Bs 2,750). The capped pension branches (vejez 10% + riesgo comun 1.71% = 11.71%) apply to **Bs 165,000**, not Bs 200,000. The comision (0.50%), aporte solidario (0.50%) and ANS may be on uncapped total ganado **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm which branches the 60-SMN cap covers, R-BO-P-8]**.

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vejez + riesgo comun (capped) | 165,000.00 | 11.71% | 19,321.50 |
| Comision + aporte solidario (cap status to confirm) | 200,000.00 | 1.00% | 2,000.00 |
| **Pension-side subtotal (illustrative)** | -- | -- | **21,321.50** |

### Example 6 — Employer Aporte Patronal remittance (Bs 12,000 employee, general)

**Bank statement line (employer debit):**
`05/07/2025 ; GESTORA + CNS APORTE PATRONAL ; DEBITO ; Aportes junio ; -2.065,20 ; Bs`

**Reasoning:**
Employer Aporte Patronal = 17.21% x total ganado. For Example 3 (Bs 12,000): CNS 10% = Bs 1,200.00; riesgo profesional 1.71% = Bs 205.20; pro-vivienda 2% = Bs 240.00; APS 3.5% = Bs 420.00. Total = 1,200.00 + 205.20 + 240.00 + 420.00 = **Bs 2,065.20** (= 17.21% x 12,000). This is an **employer expense**, separate from the employee Aporte Laboral and the RC-IVA withheld. (A **mining** employer would pay 19.51% = Bs 2,341.20.)

| Component | Base | Rate | Amount (Bs) |
|---|---|---|---|
| CNS (health) | 12,000.00 | 10.00% | 1,200.00 |
| Riesgo profesional | 12,000.00 | 1.71% | 205.20 |
| Pro-vivienda (housing) | 12,000.00 | 2.00% | 240.00 |
| Aporte Patronal Solidario | 12,000.00 | 3.50% | 420.00 |
| **Total employer (general)** | -- | **17.21%** | **2,065.20** |

## Section 10 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic)

1. **RC-IVA is Bolivia's personal income tax**, levied at a **flat 13%** on individuals' income including salaried/dependent workers (Ley N° 843, Arts. 19+). There is no progressive scale.
2. For **dependent employees** the employer is the **agente de retencion**: it deducts the employee pension contributions (**12.71%**), subtracts a **non-taxable minimum of 2 SMN**, applies **13%**, then offsets the **presumed VAT credit plus 13% of the VAT on submitted facturas (Form 110)**. (Ley 843; DS 21531; PwC.)
3. **Non-taxable minimum = 2 SMN/month** = **Bs 5,500 in 2025** and **Bs 6,600 in 2026**; historically the presumed VAT credit (13% of 2 SMN) made the effective exemption ~4 SMN of gross salary. (Ley 843; DS 5383; DS 5516.)
4. **DS 5383 (1 May 2025)** reportedly reduced the presumed-VAT-credit reference from **2 SMN to 1 SMN**, raising RC-IVA liability for mid-earners (above ~Bs 9,400/month) unless they submit invoices. **[RESEARCH GAP — verify exact wording.]** (Advisory: Rigoberto Paredes; Bolivia Impuestos.)
5. **Employee pension-side contribution (Aporte Laboral) = 12.71%** of total ganado: 10% vejez + 1.71% riesgo comun + 0.50% comision Gestora + 0.50% aporte solidario; **capped at 60 SMN** and **deductible** from the RC-IVA base. (PwC; Ley 065; Planifica.)
6. **Employer social charges (Aporte Patronal) = 17.21%** of total ganado for general employers (**19.51% mining**): 10% CNS health + 1.71% riesgo profesional + 2% pro-vivienda + 3.5% Aporte Patronal Solidario. (PwC; Ley 1582.)
7. The **Aporte Patronal Solidario rose from 3.0% to 3.5%** under Ley 1582 (eff. 1 Oct 2024); the employer total moved from 16.71% to 17.21%. (Ley 1582; PwC.)
8. **Aporte Nacional Solidario (ANS)** applies **only to total ganado above Bs 13,000/month**, cumulative marginal: **1.15%** (over Bs 13,000) **+ 5.74%** (over Bs 25,000) **+ 11.48%** (over Bs 35,000); pre-Ley 1582 the rates were 1% / 5% / 10%. (Ley 1582; MEFP.)
9. **Pension cap = 60 SMN/month** = Bs 165,000 in 2025 (Bs 198,000 in 2026) on vejez and riesgo comun. (PwC; Ley 065.)
10. **SMN:** Bs 2,750/month for 2025 (DS 5383, +10%); Bs 3,300/month for 2026 (DS 5516, +20%, retroactive to 1 Jan 2026). The SMN drives both the 2-SMN minimum and the 60-SMN cap. (DS 5383; DS 5516.)
11. **RC-IVA monthly remittance:** employers file **Form 608 v.4** by the due date set by the **last digit of the NIT** (NIT ending 0 → day 13, 1 → 14, … 9 → day 22 of the following month); weekend/holiday deadlines roll to the next business day. (SIN Calendario Tributario 2025.)
12. **Employees claim VAT credits via Form 110** (now through the "Mis Facturas" app under RND 102000000025 / RND 1020-25), submitted monthly to the employer; direct/independent RC-IVA taxpayers use **Form 610**. (SIAT.)
13. **Christmas aguinaldo** (1 month salary, payable by ~20 December) is mandatory; the **segundo aguinaldo** (DS 1802) is only mandatory when **GDP growth > 4.5%**. **Indemnizacion** (1 month/year) and **desahucio** (3 months) are **RC-IVA-exempt** (DS 21531); the aguinaldo's RC-IVA treatment is unsettled across sources. **[RESEARCH GAP.]** (PwC; DS 21531; DS 1802; Deel.)
14. **Penalty for omision de pago is 60% of the unpaid tax** (in UFV), reducible to **80% off** (pay within 20 days of the Vista de Cargo) or **60% off** (before appealing the Resolucion Determinativa); tax debt is **indexed to UFV plus interest** from the due date. (Ley 2492; RND 102200000016.)
15. **Pension/health contributions are computed on total ganado (gross)**; all amounts are in **bolivianos (BOB)**.

## Section 11 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement)

Items requiring professional judgement; apply the default and flag the question.

### 11.1 RC-IVA presumed VAT credit (DS 5383)
*Default:* conservative — presumed credit = 13% x **1 SMN** (higher liability). *Question:* "Does DS 5383 (1 May 2025) reduce the presumed VAT-credit reference from 2 SMN to 1 SMN?" — R-BO-P-7. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

### 11.2 Submitted facturas (Form 110)
*Default:* assume **no facturas** (maximum withholding). *Question:* "What is the employee's monthly Form 110 invoice total? 13% of it offsets the RC-IVA."

### 11.3 Aguinaldo RC-IVA treatment
*Default:* treat the **Christmas aguinaldo** as RC-IVA-exempt (PwC) but flag. *Question:* "Is the aguinaldo de Navidad RC-IVA-exempt (PwC/DS 21531) or taxable (some Bolivian sources)?" — R-BO-P-6. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

### 11.4 ANS deductibility and computation
*Default:* treat the ANS as deductible from the RC-IVA base; compute cumulatively. *Question:* "Is the ANS deductible from the RC-IVA base, and is the marginal computation stacked (1.15% / 6.89% / 18.37%)?" — R-BO-P-8. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

### 11.5 Pension cap scope
*Default:* apply the 60-SMN cap to vejez and riesgo comun. *Question:* "Do the 0.50% comision, 0.50% aporte solidario and the ANS also sit under the 60-SMN cap, or on uncapped total ganado?" **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

## Section 13 -- Bolivia Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

**CSV conventions.** Bolivian banks (Banco Mercantil Santa Cruz, Banco Nacional de Bolivia / BNB, Banco Union, Banco BISA, Banco de Credito BCP) typically use semicolon or comma delimiters and DD/MM/YYYY dates. **BOB (Bs)** only; amounts often use the **comma as decimal separator and period as thousands separator** (e.g. `2.400,47`). Narratives are in Spanish.

**Language variants (treat as English equivalent):**

| Spanish | English |
|---|---|
| Sueldo / Salario / Haber / Remuneracion | Salary |
| Total ganado | Gross earnings (the contribution/RC-IVA base) |
| Planilla de sueldos / Nomina | Payroll run |
| Planilla tributaria | Consolidated tax/contribution declaration |
| RC-IVA / Regimen Complementario al IVA | Personal income tax (withholding) |
| Retencion | Withholding |
| Aporte Laboral | Employee pension-side contribution (12.71%) |
| Aporte Patronal | Employer social charges (17.21% / 19.51%) |
| Gestora Publica / AFP | Long-term (pension) collector |
| Caja Nacional de Salud / CNS | Short-term health collector |
| Riesgo comun / Riesgo profesional | Common-risk / work-accident branch |
| Aporte Solidario / Aporte Nacional Solidario | Solidarity contribution(s) |
| Aguinaldo / Segundo aguinaldo | Christmas / second 13th-month bonus |
| Indemnizacion / Desahucio / Finiquito | Severance / dismissal compensation / final settlement |
| Factura | Tax invoice (claimed via Form 110) |
| Horas extras | Overtime |

**Authority counterparties.** "SIN" / "Impuestos Nacionales" / "SIAT" = the tax authority (RC-IVA, Forms 608/610/110). "Gestora" / "Gestora Publica" / "AFP" = the long-term pension collector (vejez, riesgo comun, comision, solidario, ANS, riesgo profesional). "CNS" / "Caja Nacional de Salud" = the short-term health collector (employer 10%).

**Identifier.** "NIT" (Numero de Identificacion Tributaria) — the employer's tax ID; its **last digit** sets the Form 608 monthly due date.

---

## Section 14 -- Onboarding Fallback

### 14.1 Worker type
*Inference:* employment contract = dependent employee. *Fallback:* "Is this a dependent employee on payroll or a contribuyente directo (Form 610)?" If direct → R-BO-P-2.

### 14.2 Total ganado
*Fallback:* "What is the monthly total ganado (gross), and any bonuses / prima / aguinaldo this period?" If missing → R-BO-P-1.

### 14.3 Year / SMN
*Inference:* current calendar year. *Fallback:* "Which year's pay period? SMN = Bs 2,750 (2025) or Bs 3,300 (2026); it drives the 2-SMN RC-IVA minimum and the 60-SMN cap."

### 14.4 Form 110 facturas
*Fallback:* "Has the employee submitted Form 110 invoices (facturas) this month? 13% of the invoice VAT offsets the RC-IVA; if none, the conservative (maximum) withholding applies."

### 14.5 Employer sector and NIT
*Fallback:* "Is the employer in the mining sector (19.51%) or general (17.21%)? What is the last digit of the NIT (it sets the Form 608 due date)?"

### 14.6 Termination / aguinaldo
*Fallback:* "Is this a termination (indemnizacion/desahucio/finiquito) or an aguinaldo computation? These have special RC-IVA treatment." → R-BO-P-5 / R-BO-P-6.

### 14.7 DS 5383 / ANS
*Fallback:* "For mid/high earners, confirm the DS 5383 presumed-credit basis (R-BO-P-7) and whether the ANS applies (total ganado > Bs 13,000) and is deductible (R-BO-P-8)."

## Section 15 -- Filing Obligations and Penalties

### Forms and Deadlines

| Form | Purpose | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| **Form 608 (RC-IVA Agentes de Retencion) v.4** | Employer's monthly consolidated RC-IVA withholding declaration; filed only when there is tax withheld and/or balances in favor of dependents | **Monthly**, by the due date per **last digit of the employer's NIT** (NIT ending 0 → day 13, 1 → 14, … 9 → day 22 of the following month) (SIN Calendario Tributario 2025) |
| **Form 110 (RC-IVA dependientes)** | Employee's submission of invoices/facturas to claim the 13% VAT credit; generated via the "Mis Facturas" app in SIAT (RND 102000000025 / RND 1020-25) | Submitted **monthly to the employer** (agente de retencion) per current regulation (SIAT) |
| **Form 610 (RC-IVA Contribuyente Directo) v.4** | RC-IVA declaration for direct/independent taxpayers (directors' fees, rental income, foreign-employer salaried individuals) | Quarterly / monthly per regulation, by NIT last-digit calendar (SIAT) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact frequency]** |
| **Planilla de Aportes (Gestora Publica)** | Monthly pension/social contribution declaration and payment to the Gestora Publica | **Monthly** (typically by the last day of the following month) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current Gestora calendar]** |
| **CNS planilla** | Monthly health contribution declaration and payment to the Caja Nacional de Salud (or chosen Caja) | **Monthly** — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current CNS deadline]** |

### Penalties and Interest

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Omision de pago** | Fine of **60% of the unpaid tax (omitido)**, maintained in UFV value. Reducible: **80% reduction** if paid within 20 days of the Vista de Cargo; **60% reduction** if paid before appealing the Resolucion Determinativa. (Ley 2492; RND 102200000016.) |
| **Mantenimiento de valor + intereses** | Tax debt is updated to **UFV** (inflation-indexed) **plus interest** from the original due date until payment. (Ley 2492.) |
| **Incumplimiento de deberes formales (IDF)** | Fixed fines (in UFV) for late/missing declarations and formal-duty breaches per RND 10-0012-04 (and successors); amounts differ for individuals vs companies. **[RESEARCH GAP — IDF fixed-fine amounts vary by RND and taxpayer type and were not enumerated.]** (RND 10-0012-04; SIN sanciones table.) |
| **Aguinaldo non-payment** | **Labor (not tax) penalty:** failure to pay the aguinaldo by the deadline obliges the employer to pay **double (doble aguinaldo)**. (Ministerio de Trabajo instructivo.) |

## Section 16 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (RC-IVA withholding + social contributions) | **This skill (bolivia-payroll.md)** |
| Direct/independent RC-IVA (Form 610) | Bolivia direct-RC-IVA / income-tax skill |
| Bolivia VAT (IVA) | bolivia-iva.md |
| Employer corporate tax (IUE) | Bolivia corporate-tax skill |
| Cross-border / expat / treaty | cross-border skill |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and the employer Aporte Patronal (CNS, riesgo profesional, pro-vivienda, APS) are **expenses**; the RC-IVA withheld and the employee Aporte Laboral / ANS are **liabilities** until remitted to the SIN / Gestora / CNS.
- **Payroll → RC-IVA (direct):** Non-dependent income (directors' fees, rentals, foreign-paid salary) is self-declared on Form 610, not withheld through payroll.
- **Payroll → VAT (IVA):** The employee's Form 110 facturas feed the 13% RC-IVA VAT credit; this is the personal mirror of the company's IVA system.

### Known Gaps

1. **DS 5383 presumed VAT credit:** multiple advisory sources say it reduced the presumed-credit reference from 2 SMN to 1 SMN, increasing liability, but this was **not confirmed from the decree itself**. The conservative (1-SMN) figure is used. (R-BO-P-7.)
2. **Employer total 17.21% (PwC) vs 16.71% (some Bolivian guides):** the difference is the Aporte Patronal Solidario at 3.5% (post-Ley 1582) vs 3.0% (pre-1582). 17.21% (3.5% APS) is used; confirm the effective date for payroll application.
3. **Aguinaldo RC-IVA treatment:** PwC states all bonuses except the Christmas bonus are taxable, while some Bolivian sources list the aguinaldo as taxable and only indemnizacion/desahucio/quinquenio as exempt (DS 21531). Reconcile before finalizing. (R-BO-P-6.)
4. **Pension cap scope:** PwC cites 60 SMN (~USD 28,450); whether the 0.50% comision, 0.50% aporte solidario and the ANS sit under the cap or on uncapped total ganado is unconfirmed. The Gestora monthly payment deadline was not confirmed from the Gestora Publica site.
5. **ANS computation:** the brackets are applied cumulatively/marginally across Bs 13,000 / 25,000 / 35,000 per the MEFP description; the precise marginal-vs-stacked computation and **ANS deductibility from the RC-IVA base** need a worked example confirmed with the authority. (R-BO-P-8.)
6. **2026 SMN Bs 3,300 (DS 5516):** reported by multiple secondary sources and consistent, but confirm against the Gaceta Oficial.
7. **IDF fixed-fine amounts** vary by RND and taxpayer type and were not enumerated in detail.
8. **Official-source access:** several SIN/SIAT and MEFP pages repeatedly failed TLS certificate verification or returned 403 in the research environment; many figures rest on secondary (Big-4 / Bolivian advisory) sources and should be re-verified directly against the authority before publication. Data primarily reflects **tax year 2025** with the **2026 SMN** noted.

### Test Suite

A correct implementation should pass each of these checks (2025 parameter set: SMN Bs 2,750; 2-SMN minimum Bs 5,500; 60-SMN cap Bs 165,000; presumed credit conservatively 13% x 1 SMN = Bs 357.50; no facturas unless stated):

1. **RC-IVA flat rate:** RC-IVA is a single **13%** flat rate (no progressive brackets).
2. **Employee Aporte Laboral:** 10.00 + 1.71 + 0.50 + 0.50 = **12.71%** of total ganado; deductible from the RC-IVA base.
3. **Employer Aporte Patronal (general):** 10.00 + 1.71 + 2.00 + 3.50 = **17.21%**; mining = **19.51%**.
4. **APS step-up:** the Aporte Patronal Solidario is **3.5%** (post-Ley 1582), making the employer total 17.21% (was 16.71% at 3.0%).
5. **Minimum-wage nil RC-IVA (Ex.1):** total ganado Bs 2,750 → Aporte Laboral Bs 349.53; RC-IVA base 2,750 − 349.53 − 5,500 < 0 → RC-IVA **Bs 0**; net **Bs 2,400.47**.
6. **Low earner nil RC-IVA (Ex.2):** Bs 8,000 → base 1,483.20 → gross RC-IVA Bs 192.82 < presumed credit Bs 357.50 → RC-IVA **Bs 0**; net **Bs 6,983.20**.
7. **Mid earner RC-IVA due (Ex.3):** Bs 12,000 → base 4,974.80 → gross RC-IVA Bs 646.72 − Bs 357.50 = **Bs 289.22** withheld; net **Bs 10,185.58**.
8. **ANS threshold:** total ganado ≤ Bs 13,000 → ANS **Bs 0**.
9. **ANS cumulative (Ex.4):** Bs 30,000 → (25,000−13,000) x 1.15% + (30,000−25,000) x 6.89% = 138.00 + 344.50 = **Bs 482.50**.
10. **High earner net (Ex.4):** Bs 30,000 → employee social 4,295.50, RC-IVA withheld 2,269.09 → net **Bs 23,435.41** (ANS treated as deductible — flag R-BO-P-8).
11. **Pension cap (Ex.5):** Bs 200,000 → vejez + riesgo comun (11.71%) on capped Bs 165,000 = **Bs 19,321.50**, not on Bs 200,000.
12. **Employer remittance (Ex.6):** Bs 12,000 → 17.21% = CNS 1,200.00 + riesgo 205.20 + vivienda 240.00 + APS 420.00 = **Bs 2,065.20**.
13. **Form 608 due date:** filed monthly by the **last digit of the NIT** (0 → day 13 … 9 → day 22 of the following month).
14. **Form 110 / 610:** employees claim VAT credits via Form 110 ("Mis Facturas"); contribuyentes directos use Form 610.
15. **Exempt termination:** indemnizacion (1 month/year) and desahucio (3 months) are **RC-IVA-exempt** (DS 21531) — flag R-BO-P-5, do not run through monthly withholding.
16. **Omision de pago penalty:** **60%** of the unpaid tax (in UFV), reducible to 80% off (within 20 days of the Vista de Cargo) or 60% off (before appealing).
17. **DS 5383 sensitivity:** under the historical 2-SMN presumed credit (Bs 715.00), Example 3's Bs 646.72 gross RC-IVA would be fully covered → Bs 0; under the conservative 1-SMN credit it is Bs 289.22. Flag R-BO-P-7.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER treat Bolivia as having **no personal income tax** — RC-IVA is a flat 13% personal income tax withheld from salaries (Ley 843); the exemption is delivered through the 2-SMN minimum and VAT credits, not a 0% band.
- NEVER compute RC-IVA without first deducting the employee Aporte Laboral (**12.71%**) and the **2-SMN** non-taxable minimum (Bs 5,500 in 2025; Bs 6,600 in 2026) from total ganado.
- NEVER omit the **presumed VAT credit** and the Form 110 factura credit when computing RC-IVA withheld — for most low/mid earners these reduce RC-IVA to nil.
- NEVER use the historical 2-SMN presumed credit for mid-earners without confirming DS 5383 — use the conservative 1-SMN figure and flag R-BO-P-7. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**
- NEVER apply the **Aporte Nacional Solidario** below Bs 13,000/month, and never apply it as a flat rate — it is cumulative marginal (1.15% / 6.89% / 18.37% effective bands).
- NEVER charge the employer RC-IVA — the employer is only the **agente de retencion**; RC-IVA is the employee's tax.
- NEVER charge the **employer** the employee pension branches (vejez, comision, aporte solidario, ANS) — these are employee-only.
- NEVER use **16.71%** for general employer charges — the current total is **17.21%** (3.5% APS, post-Ley 1582); mining is 19.51%.
- NEVER compute capped pension branches above the **60-SMN** cap (Bs 165,000/month in 2025; Bs 198,000 in 2026).
- NEVER mix SMN years — use **Bs 2,750** for 2025 and **Bs 3,300** for 2026; the SMN drives both the 2-SMN minimum and the 60-SMN cap.
- NEVER run a termination (indemnizacion / desahucio / finiquito) through standard monthly RC-IVA withholding — these are RC-IVA-exempt (DS 21531); flag R-BO-P-5.
- NEVER run a contribuyente directo (Form 610) through dependent payroll — flag R-BO-P-2.
- NEVER miss the **Form 608** deadline (per NIT last digit, days 13-22 of the following month) — omision de pago carries a 60% (UFV-indexed) penalty plus interest.
- NEVER fail to pay the aguinaldo by its deadline — the labor penalty is **double aguinaldo**.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Bolivian reviewer (contador / auditor).
