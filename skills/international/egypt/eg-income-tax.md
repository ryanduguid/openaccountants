# Egypt Personal Income Tax (ضريبة الدخل) Skill v1.0

This skill covers Egyptian personal income tax (ضريبة الدخل على الأشخاص الطبيعيين)
for **resident individuals**, **sole proprietors (منشأة فردية)**, and
**professionals / non-commercial activity (مهن حرة)**. The AI must reply in the
user's language (English or Arabic / Egyptian Arabic) and may use the native tax
terms shown throughout.

> **Currency note:** all figures are in Egyptian Pounds (EGP / ج.م).
> **YMYL — verify before relying.** Egyptian brackets and exemptions changed in
> 2024 and 2025. Where this skill says "verify current value," re-confirm against
> the Egyptian Tax Authority (ETA — eta.gov.eg), PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries
> (taxsummaries.pwc.com/egypt) or a Big-4 alert before filing.

## Section 1 — Quick reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Egypt (جمهورية مصر العربية) |
| Tax | Personal Income Tax (ضريبة الدخل على الأشخاص الطبيعيين) |
| Currency | EGP (Egyptian Pound — ج.م) |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 January – 31 December) for individuals |
| Legislation | Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005 (as amended) — including the 2024 bracket reset and Laws No. 5, 6 and 7 of 2025 |

### Progressive tax brackets — tax year 2026

Rates apply to **annual taxable income after deducting the personal exemption**
and allowable deductions. Tax is computed band-by-band (marginal), subject to the
high-earner bracket-elimination rule below.

| Band (taxable income, EGP) | Rate | Native |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 40,000 | 0% | معفى |
| 40,001 – 55,000 | 10% | |
| 55,001 – 70,000 | 15% | |
| 70,001 – 200,000 | 20% | |
| 200,001 – 400,000 | 22.5% | |
| 400,001 – 1,200,000 | 25% | |
| Over 1,200,000 | 27.5% | الشريحة العليا |

**High-earner bracket-elimination rule (مهم):** Egypt does **not** grant the lower
bands to high earners. As total annual taxable income rises past defined
thresholds, the 0% band (and then successively higher bands) is withdrawn, so the
highest earners are taxed across the upper bands only. The 0% first band is
available only to residents whose annual income does **not exceed EGP 1,200,000**.
*The exact step thresholds at which each lower band is removed must be verified
against the current ETA schedule before filing.* When the precise schedule is
unknown, compute the straightforward marginal result AND flag that the
bracket-elimination adjustment may increase tax — defer the final number to a
qualified Egyptian accountant.

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether an expense is deductible | Treat as **non-deductible** until documentary support (e-invoice/receipt) is confirmed |
| Unknown whether high-earner bracket-elimination applies | Compute marginal tax AND warn it may be higher; do not finalise |
| Unknown personal exemption for the year | Use EGP 20,000 and label "verify current value" |
| Unknown residency | Treat as **non-resident** (Egyptian-source income only) until residency confirmed |
| Unknown whether SME regime is better | Compute normal regime; cross-ref `eg-sme-tax` for comparison |
| Mixed personal/business expense | Disallow the personal portion |

## Section 2 — Required inputs & refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

1. **Residency status.** Resident if present in Egypt > 183 days in a 12-month
   period, or Egypt is the centre of vital/commercial interests, or an Egyptian
   working abroad whose income is paid by an Egyptian treasury. Residents are
   taxed on worldwide income for activities managed/realised in Egypt; non-residents
   on Egyptian-source income only.
2. **Activity category:** employment (مرتبات وأجور), commercial & industrial
   activity (نشاط تجاري وصناعي), or non-commercial / professional activity
   (مهن غير تجارية). Each has its own income-determination rules but feeds the
   same progressive scale.
3. **Gross receipts / revenue** for the tax year, with supporting documents.
4. **Business expenses** with e-invoices / receipts (electronic invoicing is the
   ETA standard).
5. **Insurance & pension contributions** (for the capped deduction).
6. **Withholding tax already suffered** (advance payments / WHT certificates) to
   credit against the final liability.
7. **Tax year** and whether the SME alternative regime has been elected.

### Refusal catalogue (R-EG-n)

- **R-EG-1** — Do not produce a final filing figure without the residency status confirmed.
- **R-EG-2** — Do not deduct an expense lacking documentary support (e-invoice/receipt). Disallow it.
- **R-EG-3** — Do not finalise tax for income > EGP 1,200,000, or where bracket-elimination may apply, without a qualified Egyptian accountant confirming the band schedule.
- **R-EG-4** — Refuse to advise on tax evasion, under-declaration of receipts, or fictitious expenses.
- **R-EG-5** — Do not apply the simplified SME (turnover-based) regime here; route to `eg-sme-tax` and confirm eligibility (turnover ≤ EGP 20m and election made).
- **R-EG-6** — Do not advise on corporate income tax (companies) — this skill is individuals only.
- **R-EG-7** — Do not give a binding figure where the current-year bracket/exemption values cannot be verified; provide the formula and flag "verify current value."
- **R-EG-8** — Do not net foreign tax credits or apply tax treaties without explicit treaty confirmation; flag for professional review.

## Section 4 — Worked examples

> All figures illustrative; verify the live bracket/exemption schedule before filing.

### Example 1 — Freelance developer, low income

Net professional profit EGP 90,000. Personal exemption EGP 20,000 → taxable
EGP 70,000.
- 0–40,000 @ 0% = 0
- 40,000–55,000 @ 10% = 1,500
- 55,000–70,000 @ 15% = 2,250
- **Tax = EGP 3,750.**

### Example 2 — Sole proprietor shop (commercial activity)

Gross receipts EGP 600,000; documented deductible expenses EGP 250,000 → net
profit EGP 350,000. Exemption EGP 20,000 → taxable EGP 330,000.
- 0–40,000 @ 0% = 0
- 40,000–55,000 @ 10% = 1,500
- 55,000–70,000 @ 15% = 2,250
- 70,000–200,000 @ 20% = 26,000
- 200,000–330,000 @ 22.5% = 29,250
- **Tax = EGP 59,000.**

### Example 3 — Professional with capped insurance deduction

Net profit EGP 250,000; life/health/pension premiums EGP 18,000. Deduction
capped at the lower of 15% of net revenue or EGP 10,000 → deduct EGP 10,000.
Personal exemption EGP 20,000. Taxable = 250,000 − 10,000 − 20,000 = EGP 220,000.
- 0–40,000 @ 0% = 0
- 40,000–55,000 @ 10% = 1,500
- 55,000–70,000 @ 15% = 2,250
- 70,000–200,000 @ 20% = 26,000
- 200,000–220,000 @ 22.5% = 4,500
- **Tax = EGP 34,250.**

### Example 4 — High earner (top band + elimination flag)

Net taxable income EGP 1,500,000.
- Marginal computation: 0 + 1,500 + 2,250 + 26,000 + 45,000 (200k–400k @22.5%) +
  200,000 (400k–1.2m @25%) + 82,500 (300k @27.5%) = **EGP 357,250 marginal.**
- **⚠ Flag (R-EG-3):** income exceeds EGP 1,200,000, so the 0% band (and possibly
  lower bands) is **eliminated**, raising the actual tax above the marginal figure.
  Defer the final number to a qualified Egyptian accountant and verify the current
  band-elimination schedule.

### Example 5 — Normal vs SME comparison

Trading turnover EGP 4,000,000; net profit after expenses EGP 700,000.
- Normal regime (progressive on net profit) — compute and flag the high-earner
  elimination rule.
- SME regime (Law No. 6 of 2025): turnover ≤ EGP 20m → tax ≈ **1% of turnover**
  (EGP 3m–10m band) = EGP 40,000, subject to eligibility and election.
- Present both; route the SME path to `eg-sme-tax`. The taxpayer may benefit
  materially from the SME regime here — recommend professional confirmation.

### Example 6 — Non-resident, Egyptian-source fee

Non-resident consultant earns EGP 100,000 of Egyptian-source professional fees.
Taxed on Egyptian-source income only; personal exemption generally available to
residents — **verify exemption availability for non-residents** and check WHT/
treaty position (R-EG-8). Flag for professional review.

## Section 5 — Tier 1 rules (law refs) + Tier 2

### Tier 1 — settled rules with citations

- **T1-1** Tax base is **annual net profit** for both commercial/industrial and
  non-commercial (professional) activity (Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005, as amended).
- **T1-2** Progressive scale 0% / 10% / 15% / 20% / 22.5% / 25% / 27.5%, top band
  over EGP 1,200,000 (current schedule per ETA / PwC, TY2026). *Verify current value.*
- **T1-3** Annual personal exemption EGP 20,000 (raised from EGP 15,000 effective
  21 Feb 2024). *Verify current value.*
- **T1-4** 0% first band available only to residents with annual income ≤ EGP 1,200,000;
  high-earner bracket-elimination applies above that — *verify the step schedule.*
- **T1-5** Insurance/pension premiums + private fund contributions deductible up to
  the **lower of 15% of net revenue or EGP 10,000**.
- **T1-6** Deductible expenses must be connected to the activity and supported by
  electronic invoices/receipts; personal expenses, fines, and income tax itself
  are non-deductible.
- **T1-7** Business losses carry forward up to **5 years** (restrictions on >50%
  ownership/activity change).
- **T1-8** Annual return filing deadline **31 March** following the tax year for
  individuals.
- **T1-9** Simplified turnover-based SME regime for businesses with annual turnover
  ≤ EGP 20m introduced by **Law No. 6 of 2025** (rates ~0.4%–1.5% of turnover by
  band) — handled in `eg-sme-tax`.
- **T1-10** 2025 procedural package (Laws No. 5 & 7 of 2025): settlement/amnesty
  windows and a cap that delay interest/additional tax cannot exceed 100% of
  principal tax — relevant to penalties, not the base computation.

### Tier 2 — judgement / ambiguity (resolve conservatively, flag for reviewer)

- **T2-1** Allocating mixed personal/business expenses — disallow personal share.
- **T2-2** Depreciation rates and asset categories — apply law schedules; flag if uncertain.
- **T2-3** Treatment of foreign-source income for residents and treaty relief — flag (R-EG-8).
- **T2-4** Whether a receipt is a trading receipt vs capital/loan — default to caution.
- **T2-5** Exact high-earner band-elimination thresholds — *verify; do not finalise.*

## Section 6 — Excel working paper template

Recommended columns for the income tax working paper (ورقة عمل ضريبة الدخل):

| Col | Header (EN) | Header (AR) |
|---|---|---|
| A | Date | التاريخ |
| B | Description | البيان |
| C | Counterparty | الطرف الآخر |
| D | Category (income/expense/non-deductible/exclusion) | التصنيف |

| F | Document ref (e-invoice no.) | رقم الفاتورة الإلكترونية |
| G | Deductible? (Y/N) | قابل للخصم؟ |
| H | Note / disallowance reason | ملاحظات |

**Summary block:**

```
Gross receipts (إجمالي الإيرادات)            = SUM(income)
Less deductible expenses (المصروفات)         = SUM(deductible)
Net profit (صافي الربح)                      = receipts − expenses
Less insurance/pension (capped)              = MIN(15% net revenue, 10,000)
Less personal exemption (الإعفاء الشخصي)     = 20,000   [verify]
Taxable income (الوعاء الضريبي)              = net profit − deductions
Tax (band-by-band)                           = progressive calc
  ⚠ apply high-earner band-elimination if income > 1,200,000
Less WHT / advance payments                  = credits
Tax payable / refundable (المستحق)           = tax − credits
```

Build the progressive calc as a stepped formula per band; keep each band on its
own row so a reviewer can audit it.

## Section 7 — Bank Statement Reading Guide

Egyptian statements (كشف حساب) appear in Arabic, English, or both. Common formats:

- **National Bank of Egypt — البنك الأهلي المصري (NBE):** Arabic-first; debit =
  مدين, credit = دائن. Look for مبيعات / تحصيل (income) and سحب / مدفوعات (payments).
- **Banque Misr — بنك مصر:** bilingual; transfers labelled تحويل (transfer),
  إيداع (deposit), سحب (withdrawal).
- **Commercial International Bank — CIB (البنك التجاري الدولي):** often
  English-first with Arabic memo lines; POS/merchant settlements show as
  "POS Settlement" or تسوية نقاط بيع → business income.

### Key Arabic banking terms

| Arabic | English |
|---|---|
| كشف حساب | bank statement |
| رصيد | balance |
| مدين | debit |
| دائن | credit |
| إيداع | deposit |
| سحب | withdrawal |
| تحويل | transfer |
| تحصيل | collection / receipt |
| مرتجع | refund / return |
| رسوم بنكية | bank charges (deductible business expense) |
| فائدة دائنة | interest earned (investment income — exclude from business profit) |
| نقاط البيع | point of sale (POS) |

Reconcile statement receipts to declared revenue; unexplained deposits should be
queried, not assumed taxable or non-taxable (apply R-EG-1/R-EG-2 discipline).

## Section 8 — Onboarding fallback, references & test suite

### Onboarding fallback

If required inputs are missing, ask (in the user's language): residency status,
activity category, the tax year, gross receipts, documented expenses, insurance/
pension contributions, and any WHT suffered. Do not guess — apply conservative
defaults and flag.
