# Egypt Record-Keeping & Bookkeeping (مسك الدفاتر والسجلات) Skill v1.0

This skill explains the books, records, and **mandatory digital systems** an
Egyptian self-employed person, sole proprietor (منشأة فردية), or professional
(صاحب مهنة حرة) must maintain. Egypt has moved aggressively to a fully digital
tax ecosystem: the **e-invoicing system (منظومة الفاتورة الإلكترونية)** for
B2B/B2G, and the **e-receipt system (منظومة الإيصال الإلكتروني)** for B2C. Being
inside these systems is now a precondition for deducting input VAT and for
deducting costs. Reply to the user in their own language (English or Arabic).

## Section 1 — Quick reference & conservative defaults

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Egypt (جمهورية مصر العربية) |
| Scope | Self-employed individuals, sole proprietors (منشأة فردية), and professionals (مهن حرة). Not large corporates, banks, or regulated sectors. |
| Currency | EGP (Egyptian Pound — ج.م) |
| Mandatory digital systems | (1) e-invoicing — منظومة الفاتورة الإلكترونية (B2B/B2G); (2) e-receipt — منظومة الإيصال الإلكتروني (B2C) |
| Authority | Egyptian Tax Authority — ETA (مصلحة الضرائب المصرية) |
| Portal | eta.gov.eg (e-invoicing: invoicing.eta.gov.eg; e-receipt: e-receipt portal under ETA) |
| Legal backbone | Unified Tax Procedures Law No. 206 of 2020; Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005; VAT Law No. 67 of 2016; SME Law No. 6 of 2025 |
| Item coding | GS1 (GTIN) **or** EGS (Egyptian Goods & Services) codes mapped to GPC |
| Digital signature | Required for e-invoices (HSM / USB token / approved cloud signing) |
| Record retention | **5 years** (per Unified Tax Procedures Law) — *verify current value; some advisers cite 7 years* |
| Quality tier | **Research-verified — pending sign-off by an Egyptian accountant (محاسب قانوني)** |
| Skill version | 1.0 |

### Conservative defaults

When a fact is uncertain, the AI must take the **safer, more compliant** path
and tell the user it is doing so:

- **Assume the taxpayer is in scope.** The B2C e-receipt mandate and the
  e-invoicing mandate have rolled out in waves and the registration threshold
  was lowered (reported as EGP 500,000 → EGP 250,000 of annual revenue for late
  2025 / 2026). If turnover is near or above the threshold, assume the taxpayer
  **must** join. *Verify the exact threshold and the taxpayer's specific phase
  on eta.gov.eg.*
- **Assume an undocumented expense is non-deductible.** From the relevant phase
  onward, costs and input VAT not supported by a valid e-invoice / e-receipt are
  treated as **not deductible**.
- **Default retention is 5 years; if in doubt keep records longer** (7 years is a
  safe over-retention buffer some advisers recommend).
- **Never invent a deadline, threshold, rate, or phase date.** If you cannot
  confirm it, say "verify current value on eta.gov.eg or with an Egyptian
  accountant."

## Section 2 — The e-invoicing system (منظومة الفاتورة الإلكترونية)

The e-invoicing system handles **B2B and B2G** transactions. A registered seller
must generate a structured electronic invoice, sign it digitally, and submit it
to the ETA for **clearance/validation** before it is a legally valid invoice.

### 2.1 Who must register

E-invoicing rolled out in waves from 2020 and is now mandatory for essentially
all VAT-registered businesses and professionals doing B2B/B2G work. Reporting in
late 2025 indicates the small-business exemption threshold was lowered (cited as
EGP 500,000 → **EGP 250,000** annual revenue), with newly-in-scope taxpayers
required to register by an early-2026 deadline (cited as **31 March 2026**).
*Verify the threshold and the taxpayer's exact registration deadline on
eta.gov.eg — these figures changed recently.*

### 2.2 Registration steps (high level)

1. **Create the ETA digital profile** — register the business/professional on
   the ETA e-invoicing portal and set up authorised representatives.
2. **Obtain a digital signature (التوقيع الإلكتروني).** Egypt recognises
   electronic signatures with the same legal weight as handwritten ones (Unified
   Tax Procedures Law No. 206/2020; Digital Signature Law No. 15/2004). Get an
   AES certificate from an ETA-approved provider (e.g., Egypt Trust, Misr for
   Central Clearing). Form factors:
   - **USB token** — manual signing, suitable for very low invoice volume.
   - **HSM (Hardware Security Module) or approved cloud signing** — for automated
     / higher-volume issuance from an ERP.
3. **Code your items.** Every good or service must carry a code before it can be
   invoiced — see 2.3.
4. **Connect.** Low-volume issuers (commonly cited as **under ~200 invoices**)
   can issue directly on the ETA portal; higher volumes integrate an ERP via the
   ETA API. *Verify the current portal-vs-API threshold.*

### 2.3 Item coding — GS1 (GTIN) or EGS

Each item must be uniquely coded using one of two ETA-recognised schemes:

- **GS1 / GTIN** — register product data on MyGS1; barcodes propagate to the ETA
  platform (commonly cited as within ~24 hours).
- **EGS (Egyptian Goods & Services code)** — for items without a GS1 code; the
  internal code is linked to the **GPC (Global Product Classification)** category
  and submitted to the ETA for **review and approval** before use. Approval is
  not instant, so code your catalogue early.

### 2.4 Format & submission

- Invoices are submitted to the ETA in the **ETA structured format (JSON or XML)**
  conforming to the ETA schema.
- B2B/B2G invoices follow a **clearance model**: the invoice must be validated by
  the ETA (effectively real-time / same-day) — an unvalidated invoice is not a
  valid tax invoice.
- The buyer's **Tax Registration Number (TRN)** (or UIN for foreign entities)
  must be present and valid; an invalid TRN can block the buyer's VAT deduction.

### 2.5 Consequences of non-compliance

- **No input-VAT deduction and no cost deductibility.** Invoices not issued
  through the e-invoicing system are **not accepted for VAT input credit, VAT
  refunds, or income-tax cost deduction.** This is the single most important
  point for a self-employed client: an expense without a compliant e-invoice
  effectively costs more.
- **Penalties** under the Unified Tax Procedures Law for failure to issue/submit
  electronic documents, plus reported escalating/tiered penalties for repeated
  late submission (introduced for 2026). *Verify current penalty amounts.*
- **Loss of access to the SME simplified regime** — ETA has stated that
  e-invoice/e-receipt compliance is required to benefit from the simplified tax
  system (Law No. 6 of 2025). See Section 4.5.

---

## Section 3 — The e-receipt system (منظومة الإيصال الإلكتروني)

The e-receipt system handles **B2C** sales to final consumers (retail, services
to individuals). The seller issues the customer a receipt at the point of sale
and transmits the receipt data to the ETA.

### 3.1 Rollout status (2025 → 2026)

The e-receipt mandate has expanded in phases by ETA decision:
- Earlier 2025 phases brought specified groups in on **1 July 2025** (Decision
  123/2025) and **15 July 2025** (Decision 225/2025).
- **Decision No. 281 of 2025** extended the mandate to retail/consumer
  transactions, with a wave from **15 September 2025**, and (as reported) lowered
  the in-scope revenue threshold and tightened penalties for 2026.

By 2026 the system is described as fully operational, with enforcement focused on
bringing each remaining group into its assigned phase. **A taxpayer must check
the ETA website to confirm which phase applies to them.** *Verify the exact
phase, threshold, and date for the specific taxpayer.*

### 3.2 How it works

- **Integrate the POS / cash register or ERP** with the ETA central e-receipt
  system; receipts are transmitted with the seller's data and item codes.
- **Submission timing:** sources commonly cite real-time or **within ~24 hours**
  of issuance; one source cites a 72-hour window. *Verify the current permitted
  window on eta.gov.eg — do not promise a specific window to the client without
  confirming.*
- **QR code** must appear on the printed receipt linking to the validated
  e-receipt for consumer verification.
- The same **item coding (GS1 / EGS)** and **digital identity** requirements
  apply as for e-invoicing.

### 3.3 e-invoice vs e-receipt — which applies

| Sale | System | Model |
|---|---|---|
| To a business or government (B2B / B2G) | e-invoice (الفاتورة الإلكترونية) | Pre-clearance / validation, structured JSON/XML, buyer TRN required |
| To a final consumer (B2C) | e-receipt (الإيصال الإلكتروني) | Transmit receipt data to ETA (real-time / short window), QR code on receipt |

A self-employed person who serves **both** business clients and individual
consumers will typically need **both** systems.

## Section 4 — Books & records required

### 4.1 The general obligation to keep regular accounts

Under the Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005 and the Unified Tax Procedures Law
No. 206 of 2020, a taxpayer carrying on a commercial, industrial, or
professional activity must keep **regular, accurate accounts and records** that
allow the ETA to determine taxable profit. Keeping regular accounts is also what
lets the taxpayer be taxed on **actual net profit** (revenue minus deductible
costs) rather than on an estimated/deemed basis.

### 4.2 Core books and records (typical self-employed / sole proprietor set)

- **Cash / bank book** — receipts and payments (دفتر الصندوق/البنك).
- **Sales / revenue register** — every e-invoice and e-receipt issued.
- **Purchases / expenses register** — every supplier e-invoice received.
- **Fixed-asset register** — assets and depreciation, supporting capital
  allowances.
- **Inventory records** — where the activity holds stock.
- **Wages / payroll records** — if the taxpayer has employees.
- **Supporting documents** — contracts, bank statements, supplier e-invoices,
  customer e-receipts, import documents.

For **professionals (مهن حرة)** (e.g., doctors, lawyers, engineers, consultants,
freelance developers), keep a fee/revenue register and an expense register that
tie to issued e-invoices/e-receipts and to bank deposits.

### 4.3 Link to deductibility

Costs and input VAT are deductible **only if** supported by valid documentation
that, from the relevant mandate phase, means a **compliant e-invoice / e-receipt**
inside the ETA systems. Cash expenses with no compliant document should be
treated as non-deductible by default.

### 4.4 Retention period

Keep books, records, and supporting documents (including the electronic
documents and their ETA validation data) for **5 years** under the Unified Tax
Procedures Law. *Verify current value — some Egyptian advisers cite 7 years and
some periods run from the year-end / filing date; when unsure, retain longer.*
Electronic documents should be kept in their electronic form (XML/JSON plus the
ETA validation and any human-readable PDF).

### 4.5 Simplified-regime taxpayers (SME Law No. 6 of 2025)

Businesses and professionals with annual turnover **not exceeding EGP 20 million**
may opt into the simplified regime under Law No. 6 of 2025 (effective 1 March
2025). Under that regime:

- Tax is charged on a **turnover-banded** basis (reported bands, *verify*):
  ~0.4% under EGP 500k; ~0.5% EGP 500k–2m; ~0.75% EGP 2m–3m; ~1% EGP 3m–10m;
  ~1.5% EGP 10m–20m.
- Taxpayers are **not required to keep the full complex books** of the Unified
  Tax Procedures Law — a **simplified records system** and stand-alone simplified
  forms apply (annual income/payroll return; **quarterly** VAT returns).
- **But** e-invoicing / e-receipt compliance is still required — ETA has stated
  the simplified-regime benefits depend on being inside the digital systems.
- The election is **locked in for 5 years** (cannot be withdrawn early).

Even simplified-regime taxpayers should keep revenue records, expense records,
bank statements, and all e-invoices/e-receipts for the **5-year** retention
period.

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Freelance software developer, B2B clients only

A Cairo developer invoices three Egyptian companies. **System:** e-invoicing
(B2B). Steps: register the digital profile on the ETA portal → obtain a USB-token
digital signature (low volume) → create EGS codes for "software development
services" linked to GPC → issue each invoice in ETA JSON/XML with the client's
valid TRN → submit for clearance. Keep all issued e-invoices and supplier
e-invoices for **5 years**. Without these, the developer cannot deduct input VAT
on their laptop/software purchases.

### Example 2 — Beauty salon selling to individuals

A salon serves walk-in consumers. **System:** e-receipt (B2C). Personal-care
centres were brought into the e-receipt mandate during the 2025 phases. Integrate
the POS with the ETA e-receipt system, code services with EGS, transmit each
receipt within the permitted window, and print a **QR code** on the receipt.
*Confirm the salon's exact phase date on eta.gov.eg.*

### Example 3 — Consultant serving both companies and individuals

A consultant advises corporate clients (B2B) and also coaches private
individuals (B2C). They need **both** systems: e-invoices for the company
engagements and e-receipts for the individual sessions, sharing the same digital
identity and item codes.

### Example 4 — Small trader under the SME simplified regime

A retailer with EGP 4 million annual turnover opts into Law No. 6 of 2025
(turnover band ~1%). They keep a **simplified records system** rather than full
double-entry books and file **quarterly** VAT and an annual return — **but** must
still issue e-receipts (B2C) and any B2B e-invoices, and retain those documents
for **5 years**. Missing e-receipt compliance can disqualify them from the
simplified-regime benefits.

## Section 6 — Tier 2 escalation, references & checklist

### Tier 2 — escalate / refuse and route to a human

Hand off to a qualified Egyptian accountant (محاسب قانوني) or tax adviser when:

- The taxpayer is **not** a self-employed individual / sole proprietor /
  professional (companies, partnerships, banks, regulated sectors).
- There is a dispute, audit, assessment, or penalty notice from the ETA.
- The taxpayer needs the **exact** phase date / threshold / penalty figure — these
  change by ETA decision and must be confirmed on eta.gov.eg.
- ERP-to-ETA technical integration, HSM setup, or bulk EGS catalogue coding.
- Cross-border / non-resident, withholding tax, or transfer-pricing issues.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** state a registration threshold, phase date, submission window,
  penalty amount, or retention period as settled fact without flagging it for
  verification — these have changed recently (e.g., threshold reportedly lowered
  to EGP 250,000; e-receipt window cited as both 24h and 72h; retention cited as
  both 5 and 7 years).
- **Do NOT** advise a client to deduct input VAT or costs that are **not**
  supported by a compliant e-invoice / e-receipt.
- **Do NOT** tell a taxpayer they are exempt from e-invoicing / e-receipt — direct
  them to confirm their phase on eta.gov.eg.
- **Do NOT** invent EGS/GS1 item codes; codes must be registered and (for EGS)
  ETA-approved.
- **Do NOT** advise corporates, partnerships, banks, or regulated entities — this
  skill is scoped to self-employed individuals, sole proprietors, and professionals.
- **Do NOT** provide a digital-signature certificate, set up an HSM, or perform
  ETA portal registration on the user's behalf — guide them to ETA-approved providers.
- **Do NOT** present this output as filed advice — it requires human sign-off.

## Disclaimer

This skill is **research-verified** against public Egyptian Tax Authority
material and reputable secondary sources (PwC, KPMG, EY, Grant Thornton, GS1
Egypt) as of **May 2026**, but it has **not yet been signed off by a qualified
Egyptian accountant (محاسب قانوني)**. Egypt's e-invoicing and e-receipt rules,
thresholds, phase dates, penalties, and retention periods change frequently by
ETA decision. Treat every figure marked "verify" as provisional and confirm it
on **eta.gov.eg** or with a licensed Egyptian tax professional before relying on
it. This is general information, not tax advice, and must be reviewed by a
qualified human before filing or acting. Part of **openaccountants.com** — an
