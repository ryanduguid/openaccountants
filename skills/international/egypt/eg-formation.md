# Egypt — Business Formation & Registration for the Self-Employed

This skill walks a self-employed person in Egypt through **getting legally set up**:
obtaining a **tax card** (البطاقة الضريبية) and opening a **tax file** (ملف ضريبي)
with the **Egyptian Tax Authority — ETA** (مصلحة الضرائب المصرية), entering the
**commercial register** (السجل التجاري) where required, joining a **professional
syndicate** (نقابة) for regulated professions, choosing a tax regime at the point
of registration, registering for **VAT** and **e-invoicing**, registering for
**social insurance** (التأمينات الاجتماعية), and — if it makes sense — forming a
**limited liability company** (شركة ذات مسؤولية محدودة) through **GAFI** (الهيئة
العامة للاستثمار).

> Respond in the user's language. If the user writes in Arabic, reply in Arabic
> and keep the native legal terms (e.g. البطاقة الضريبية = tax card, السجل التجاري
> = commercial register, منشأة فردية = sole proprietorship / individual
> establishment, نقابة = professional syndicate, الهيئة العامة للاستثمار = GAFI).

### Conservative defaults

- **Default to registering, not waiting.** Operating without a tax card / tax file
  is non-compliant. If income is at or near any threshold, assume registration is
  required and confirm with ETA.
- **Default to the lower VAT threshold.** Treat **EGP 250,000** (effective 2026) as
  the trigger to register for VAT and e-invoicing, and flag "verify current value"
  — do not assume the old EGP 500,000 figure still applies.
- **Default to "syndicate first" for regulated professions.** Lawyers, doctors,
  engineers, accountants and similar professions generally **cannot practise
  lawfully** without syndicate (نقابة) membership — treat it as a prerequisite, not
  optional.
- **Default to sole proprietorship (منشأة فردية) for a solo freelancer** unless
  there is a specific reason for an LLC (see Section 5). Do not recommend an LLC by
  default.
- **Never present a fee, threshold, rate, or procedure as final** without an
  Egyptian accountant's sign-off and a same-day check against ETA / GAFI portals.
  Fees and thresholds change frequently by decree.

---

## 2. Sole-proprietor registration step-by-step

A self-employed individual in Egypt typically operates as a **منشأة فردية**
(individual establishment / sole proprietorship) or simply as a registered
individual taxpayer / professional. There is **no separate legal entity** — the
individual and the business are the same person, with unlimited personal liability.

### Step 1 — National ID and eligibility

- Egyptian nationals: a valid **national ID** (الرقم القومي), age **21+** and legal
  capacity. The national ID number is the backbone of the tax and registration
  records.
- Foreign nationals: valid **passport**, **residence permit**, and sometimes
  **activity-specific approvals** — escalate; foreigners are out of the simple
  default path. **Verify current procedure.**

### Step 2 — Proof of place of activity

- A **lease/rental contract** (عقد إيجار) or ownership document for the business
  address. Many activities require a registered address even for home-based work.
  **Verify** whether the specific activity permits a residential address.

### Step 3 — Open a tax file and obtain the tax card (البطاقة الضريبية)

- Register with the **ETA** to open a **tax file** (ملف ضريبي) at the competent tax
  office (المأمورية) for the business address, or via the ETA e-services portal
  (**eservice.incometax.gov.eg** / **eta.gov.eg**). **Verify** which steps can be
  done fully online vs in person.
- Typical documents: national ID copy, proof of address (lease), and a description
  of the activity. **Verify the current document checklist** with the local tax
  office.
- ETA issues the **tax card (البطاقة الضريبية)** — the tax identification document
  carrying the **Tax ID Number (TIN)**. This is mandatory and is required to invoice
  clients, contract with companies/government, and register for VAT.

### Step 4 — Commercial register (السجل التجاري) — for commercial/industrial activity

- The **commercial register** is required for **commercial and industrial
  activities** (e.g. trading, retail, manufacturing, most goods-based businesses).
- **Pure liberal/professional activities (المهن الحرة)** — e.g. a lawyer, doctor,
  engineer, accountant practising their profession — are generally **registered via
  their syndicate** and may **not** require a commercial register entry. **Verify
  per activity** — the line between "commercial" and "professional" determines which
  register applies.
- Commercial register entry for a sole proprietorship is administered via the
  commercial registry office / GAFI. Fees reported as nominal (e.g. an entry fee in
  the low tens of EGP, a small annual subscription scaled to declared capital, a
  name-reservation fee, and a certificate fee) — **all amounts must be verified**,
  as they change and vary by office.

### Step 5 — Professional syndicate (نقابة) — for regulated professions

- For **regulated professions**, syndicate membership is a **legal precondition to
  practise**:
  - **Lawyers** → Bar Association (نقابة المحامين).
  - **Doctors / dentists / pharmacists** → respective medical syndicates.
  - **Engineers** → Engineers Syndicate (نقابة المهندسين) — regulated under Law No.
    66 of 1974.
  - **Accountants / auditors** → Syndicate of Commercial Professions / registration
    with the Ministry of Finance accountants & auditors register and the relevant
    society (e.g. ESAA). **Verify the exact body and registration path** for public
    accounting practice.
- Membership usually requires the relevant degree, fees, and sometimes training.
  **Verify** current requirements and fees with the specific syndicate.

### Step 6 — Choose the tax regime (see Section 3) and register for VAT / e-invoicing / social insurance (see Section 4)

- At or around the time of opening the tax file, decide between the **simplified
  turnover-based regime (Law No. 6 of 2025)** and the **general system**, then
  complete VAT, e-invoicing, and social insurance registrations as applicable.

> **Order of operations (typical):** national ID → proof of address → ETA tax file
> + tax card → (commercial register **or** syndicate, per activity) → regime choice
> → VAT / e-invoicing if over threshold → social insurance. **Verify the exact
> sequence**, as some offices require the commercial register or syndicate card
> before issuing the tax card for certain activities.

---

## 3. Choosing the regime at registration (simplified vs general)

At registration the taxpayer is, in effect, choosing how their income tax will be
computed. The **integrated simplified regime under Law No. 6 of 2025** taxes a flat
**percentage of turnover** (رقم الأعمال), while the **general system** (Income Tax
Law No. 91 of 2005) taxes **net profit** under progressive brackets.

> Full simplified-regime mechanics, band rates, eligibility, exclusions, and the
> 5-year lock-in live in **`eg-sme-tax`**. Use this section only for the
> **registration-time decision**.

### Decision table

| Factor | Lean **Simplified** (Law 6/2025) | Lean **General** (Law 91/2005) |
|---|---|---|
| Annual turnover | ≤ **EGP 20,000,000** (eligibility cap) | Any; required if over the cap |
| Profit margin | **High margin** — turnover tax (0.4%–1.5% of turnover) beats profit tax | **Thin margin / loss-making** — % of turnover can exceed tax on small/zero profit |
| Bookkeeping appetite | Wants **simpler** filing & quarterly VAT | Can maintain **full accounts** and substantiate expenses |
| Deductible expenses | Few real, documentable expenses | **Large documentable expenses** that lower net profit |
| Stability | Comfortable with a **5-year commitment** | Wants flexibility year to year |
| Activity status | Eligible activity (not excluded/regulated-out) | Excluded from the simplified regime |

**Rule of thumb:** a low-cost solo freelancer with a high margin usually pays **less
under the simplified turnover regime**; a low-margin reseller or a business with
heavy documentable costs may pay **less under the general system**. **Model both**
and get accountant sign-off before electing — the simplified regime is a **5-year
lock-in** and enrolment is **not automatic** (a request to ETA must be submitted and
accepted). See `eg-sme-tax`.

---

## 4. VAT, e-invoicing and social insurance registration

These are **separate** from income tax and from the tax card — registering for a tax
file does **not** by itself register a person for VAT, e-invoicing, or social
insurance.

### 4.1 VAT registration (VAT Law No. 67 of 2016)

- **Standard VAT rate: 14%** (special/table rates apply to some goods/services —
  out of scope here; see VAT skill).
- **Registration threshold:** historically **EGP 500,000** of annual taxable
  turnover. Under **Resolution No. 281 of 2025**, the threshold is reported to be
  **lowered to EGP 250,000 effective 1 January 2026**, with a registration deadline
  reported as **31 March 2026** for those who exceeded EGP 250,000 in 2025.
  **⚠ Verify the current value and deadline with ETA before relying on it.**
- The threshold is measured on **gross revenue (turnover), not profit**.
- Register via the ETA portal once turnover crosses (or is expected to cross) the
  threshold. Voluntary registration below the threshold may be possible — **verify**.
- Within the simplified regime, **VAT returns are filed quarterly** (vs monthly in
  the general system). See `eg-sme-tax`.

### 4.2 E-invoicing / e-receipt registration (ETA portal)

- Egypt operates a mandatory **electronic invoicing** (الفاتورة الإلكترونية) and
  **electronic receipt** (الإيصال الإلكتروني) system on the ETA platform.
- **Resolution No. 281 of 2025** is reported to **expand e-invoicing/e-receipt
  obligations to smaller businesses** in step with the lowered EGP 250,000 threshold,
  with **B2C e-receipt** obligations expanding through 2025–2026. **Verify the exact
  phase-in dates and who is in scope.**
- Registration requires an **ETA portal account** and (typically) a **digital
  signature / e-seal** and onboarding of an invoicing solution. **Verify the current
  technical onboarding steps.**
- **Penalties for non-registration/non-compliance are significant** — sources cite
  fixed fines plus daily penalties and, ultimately, loss of the ability to issue
  valid invoices. **Verify current penalty figures with ETA.**

### 4.3 Social insurance registration (التأمينات الاجتماعية — Law No. 148 of 2019)

- Law **No. 148 of 2019** extended social insurance to the **self-employed**
  (أصحاب الأعمال / المهن الحرة), sole-proprietor owners, freelancers of specified
  trades, craftsmen, merchants, and others.
- Register with the **National Organisation for Social Insurance (NOSI / الهيئة
  القومية للتأمينات الاجتماعية)**.
- Self-employed contributions are commonly cited at **~21% of a chosen contribution
  (reference) wage**, selected from a statutory reference table, between a minimum and
  maximum contribution wage that is **uplifted annually**. **Verify the current rate,
  the reference-wage table, and the min/max caps** — these change each January.
- This is separate from income tax and VAT and is **not** covered by the simplified
  turnover tax. See `eg-social-insurance` for the detailed computation.

## 5. Sole proprietor vs LLC comparison

Most solo freelancers should **default to a sole proprietorship (منشأة فردية)**. An
**LLC (شركة ذات مسؤولية محدودة)** formed through **GAFI** adds cost and compliance
but provides limited liability and a separate legal personality.

| Factor | Sole proprietor (منشأة فردية) | LLC (ش.ذ.م.م) via GAFI |
|---|---|---|
| Legal personality | None — same as the individual | Separate legal entity |
| Liability | **Unlimited personal** liability | **Limited** to capital contributed |
| Owners | One individual | One+ (single-member LLC is possible — **verify**) |
| Set-up authority | ETA + commercial register / syndicate | **GAFI** (الهيئة العامة للاستثمار) |
| Minimum capital | N/A | **No statutory minimum** reported (verify) |
| Set-up cost | Low (nominal register fees) | Higher — GAFI incorporation fees, notarisation, bank account, lawyer/accountant |
| Compliance | Lighter; can use simplified regime | Heavier; audited accounts, corporate filings |
| Income tax | Personal income tax (general) or simplified turnover regime | Corporate income tax (the SME turnover regime may apply if eligible — **verify**) |
| Best for | Solo freelancers, professionals, small traders | Businesses wanting liability protection, partners/investors, larger contracts, scaling |

### When an LLC makes sense

- You want **limited liability** (e.g. higher-risk contracts, debt exposure).
- You have or plan **partners or outside investors**.
- **Clients/tenders require** a company rather than an individual.
- You are **scaling** beyond a one-person practice.

### Forming an LLC via GAFI (overview only)

1. Create an account on the **GAFI e-portal** and **reserve a company name**.
2. Submit the incorporation application with the **articles of association**, founders'
   IDs/passports, and required approvals; pay incorporation fees.
3. Obtain the **commercial register** entry and the company **tax card / tax file**
   from ETA.
4. Register for **VAT/e-invoicing** (if applicable) and **social insurance** for the
   company and any employees.

> Incorporation fees are reported in the **low hundreds of USD** range depending on
> entity type, plus professional fees. **Verify all current GAFI fees, capital rules,
> and the document checklist** — these change. Forming an LLC should be done with a
> credentialed Egyptian lawyer/accountant.

## 6. Worked examples

> All figures illustrative. Verify current thresholds, fees, rates, and procedures
> before relying on any output.

### Example 1 — Freelance graphic designer, EGP 180,000/year, solo

- **Path:** Register an individual tax file + obtain the **tax card** at ETA. Likely
  **no commercial register** (a service/professional activity) — **verify**. No
  syndicate (unregulated profession).
- **VAT:** Turnover **below** the EGP 250,000 (2026) threshold → **no mandatory VAT
  registration** yet. Watch the threshold; e-invoicing may still be encouraged —
  **verify scope**.
- **Income tax:** Eligible for the **simplified turnover regime**; high margin → likely
  cheapest. Compare with general system. See `eg-sme-tax`.
- **Social insurance:** Should register with **NOSI** as self-employed at a chosen
  reference wage — **verify rate/bands**.

### Example 2 — Software developer/contractor, EGP 900,000/year, one big client

- **Path:** Tax file + **tax card**. Service activity — check commercial register vs
  professional treatment. No syndicate.
- **VAT:** **Above** EGP 250,000 → **must register for VAT (14%)** and for
  **e-invoicing** on the ETA portal; verify the 31 Mar 2026 deadline if 2025 turnover
  exceeded the threshold.
- **Income tax:** Eligible for simplified regime (≤ EGP 20m). **Flag client
  concentration** — single-client dependence can raise exclusion/abuse questions in
  the simplified regime; escalate to `eg-sme-tax`.
- **Social insurance:** Register with NOSI; choose reference wage.

### Example 3 — Licensed engineer starting a consultancy

- **Path:** **Engineers Syndicate (نقابة المهندسين) membership is a precondition to
  practise** (Law No. 66 of 1974). Then ETA tax file + **tax card**. Professional
  activity → likely registered via syndicate rather than the commercial register —
  **verify**.
- **VAT / e-invoicing / social insurance:** as per thresholds in Section 4.
- **Regime:** Compare simplified vs general; engineering services are typically high
  margin. Confirm the activity is **not excluded** from the simplified regime.

### Example 4 — Two founders launching a product company, expecting investment

- **Path:** Form an **LLC (ش.ذ.م.م) via GAFI** — limited liability, room for
  partners/investors, credibility for contracts. Reserve name → articles of
  association → incorporation → company tax card + commercial register → VAT /
  e-invoicing / social insurance.
- **Why not sole proprietorship:** multiple owners and outside capital make a sole
  proprietorship unsuitable. Use a credentialed lawyer/accountant for incorporation.

---

## 7. Tier 2, Reference, and checklist

### Tier 2 — escalate to a credentialed Egyptian accountant/lawyer when

- The activity may sit on the **commercial vs professional** line (which register/
  syndicate applies).
- A **regulated profession** is involved (syndicate licensing nuances).
- The taxpayer is a **foreign national** or has cross-border / free-zone / SEZ
  considerations.
- Turnover is near the **VAT threshold** or the **EGP 20m** simplified-regime cap.
- The taxpayer is **choosing between sole proprietorship and an LLC**, or forming an
  LLC at all.
- There is **single-client concentration** or business **fragmentation** (simplified-
  regime exclusion risk — see `eg-sme-tax`).
- **Prior-year non-registration**, back taxes, or penalty exposure exists.

### Reference (verify each before relying on it)

- **Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005** (as amended) — general system.
- **Law No. 6 of 2025** — integrated simplified turnover-based regime (≤ EGP 20m);
  see `eg-sme-tax`.
- **Law No. 152 of 2020** — MSME Development Law (size definitions/incentives).
- **VAT Law No. 67 of 2016** (as amended) — 14% rate; registration threshold
  (historically EGP 500,000; **EGP 250,000 from 1 Jan 2026 per Resolution No. 281 of
  2025 — verify**).
- **Resolution No. 281 of 2025** — lowered VAT/e-invoicing threshold and expanded
  e-receipt obligations — **verify scope, dates, and penalties**.
- **Law No. 148 of 2019** — social insurance (incl. self-employed); see
  `eg-social-insurance`.
- **GAFI** (gafi.gov.eg) — LLC incorporation, name reservation, fees, document lists.
- **ETA** (eta.gov.eg; eservice.incometax.gov.eg) — tax file, tax card, VAT,
  e-invoicing portals.
- Professional commentary used for this skill: EY, WTS, Andersen Egypt, Deel, and
  Egyptian law-firm alerts (2025–2026).

### Registration checklist (verify each item before filing)

- [ ] National ID (or passport + residence permit for foreigners).
- [ ] Proof of business address (lease/ownership) — confirm activity allows it.
- [ ] **ETA tax file opened** + **tax card (البطاقة الضريبية)** issued.
- [ ] **Commercial register** entry (commercial/industrial activity) **or** confirm
      professional/syndicate path applies.
- [ ] **Syndicate (نقابة) membership** secured (regulated professions).
- [ ] **Regime chosen** — simplified (Law 6/2025) vs general — modelled and signed off.
- [ ] **VAT registration** done if over the (verified) threshold.
- [ ] **E-invoicing / e-receipt** onboarding done if in scope.
- [ ] **Social insurance (NOSI)** registration done; reference wage chosen.
- [ ] **(LLC only)** GAFI incorporation, articles of association, name reservation,
      company tax card, bank account.

### Deregistration / closing down

- To stop activity, **notify the ETA** and **close the tax file**, settle any
  outstanding income tax / VAT and file final returns, **cancel the commercial
  register** entry and/or syndicate membership, and **stop social insurance
  contributions** with NOSI. For an LLC, follow the **GAFI liquidation/strike-off**
  procedure. Deregistering for VAT requires meeting ETA conditions. **Verify the
  current step-by-step deregistration procedure and any clearance requirements** —
  closing badly leaves dormant liabilities and penalties.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** tell anyone they can operate without a **tax card / tax file** — that is
  non-compliant.
- **Do NOT** state the **VAT threshold** as EGP 500,000 without flagging the
  **EGP 250,000 (from 1 Jan 2026)** change and "verify current value" — do not present
  either figure as settled without an ETA check.
- **Do NOT** quote any **fee, threshold, rate, penalty, or deadline** (commercial
  register fees, GAFI incorporation fees, social-insurance rate/bands, e-invoicing
  penalties) as final without same-day verification — flag with "verify current
  value/procedure".
- **Do NOT** tell a member of a **regulated profession** they can practise without
  the relevant **syndicate (نقابة)** membership.
- **Do NOT** assume an activity is "professional" vs "commercial" (and thus which
  register applies) — verify per activity.
- **Do NOT** recommend an **LLC by default**; recommend a sole proprietorship for a
  solo freelancer unless there is a clear reason (Section 5).
- **Do NOT** advise **splitting/fragmenting** a business to stay under a threshold
  (abuse risk).
- **Do NOT** treat **foreign-national** registration as the simple default path —
  escalate.
- **Do NOT** present any registration plan as final without **sign-off from a
  qualified Egyptian accountant/lawyer**.
