# Egypt Social Insurance (التأمينات الاجتماعية) Skill v1.0

Social insurance in Egypt is governed by the **Social Insurance and Pensions Law
No. 148 of 2019** (قانون التأمينات الاجتماعية والمعاشات رقم ١٤٨ لسنة ٢٠١٩),
effective 1 January 2020. It is administered by the **National Organization for
Social Insurance — NOSI** (الهيئة القومية للتأمين الاجتماعي), under the Ministry
of Finance / Ministry of Social Solidarity (وزارة التضامن الاجتماعي).

This skill covers contribution computation for three distinct payer types:
1. **Employees** (العاملون بأجر) — the employee share withheld from salary.
2. **Employers** (أصحاب الأعمال) — the employer share paid on staff salaries.
3. **Self-employed / business owners** (المؤمن عليهم من أصحاب الأعمال والمهن الحرة)
   — the comprehensive scheme under which a sole proprietor insures themselves.

> Reply to the user **in their language**. Use English prose with native Arabic
> terms where useful. All amounts are in Egyptian Pounds (EGP / ج.م).

| Combined employee + employer | **29.75%** of the insurance wage |
| **Self-employed / business owner** | **21%** of a self-chosen contribution wage (from NOSI reference table) |

| Skill version | 1.0 |

### What each scheme covers

The single combined contribution funds the integrated branches under Law 148/2019:
old-age, disability and death pensions (الشيخوخة والعجز والوفاة), work injury
(إصابة العمل), sickness (المرض), and unemployment (البطالة), plus an end-of-service
component. The self-employed comprehensive scheme provides pension coverage on the
chosen contribution wage; some risk branches (e.g. unemployment) apply only to
salaried employees.

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown insurance wage for an employee | use the **employee's gross fixed wage**, then cap to the min/max band |
| Wage below the 2026 minimum | contribute on **EGP 2,700** (the minimum), not the actual lower figure |
| Wage above the 2026 maximum | cap the insurance wage at **EGP 16,700** |
| Self-employed contribution wage not chosen | default to the **minimum** wage tier until the client elects a higher one |
| Unsure whether a person is "employer" or "employee" | if their name is in the commercial register → treat as **employer/business owner** |
| Any rate or cap older than the current January | **re-verify against NOSI** before computing |

## Section 2 — Who contributes and how

Egypt's social insurance system separates the obligation by the payer's legal
relationship to the work. Get this classification right *before* computing — it
determines the rate and who remits.

### A. The employee (العامل بأجر)

- An employee pays **11%** of their insurance wage. The employer **withholds**
  this from salary and remits it together with the employer share.
- The employee does **not** register or pay directly — registration and remittance
  are the employer's duty.
- Cross-reference **eg-payroll** for how the 11% interacts with income tax (ضريبة
  كسب العمل) withholding on the same salary.

### B. The employer (صاحب العمل) — paying for staff

- An employer pays **18.75%** of each employee's insurance wage, **on top of** the
  employee's 11%.
- The employer registers the establishment and every employee with NOSI, submits
  the salary forms (Form 1 / Form 2 / Form 6 — Estimارات النموذج), and remits the
  **combined 29.75%** monthly.
- A separate small deduction (e.g. the Martyrs and Victims Fund, ~0.05% of gross)
  may apply at payroll — handle this in **eg-payroll**, not here.
- See **eg-payroll** for the full employer remittance workflow.

### C. The self-employed business owner (صاحب العمل / المهن الحرة) — paying for themselves

A sole proprietor, freelancer, professional, craftsman, merchant or farmer is
**self-insured** (يؤمّن على نفسه): there is no employer, so they pay the **whole**
contribution themselves.

- The comprehensive scheme rate is **21%** of a **contribution wage they choose**
  from a NOSI reference table, between the statutory minimum and maximum.
- They register **directly** with NOSI as an insured business owner.
- Because they choose the contribution wage, the monthly cost ranges from
  21% of the minimum (EGP 2,700) up to 21% of the maximum (EGP 16,700).
- **Irregular / informal-economy workers** (العمالة غير المنتظمة) may pay a reduced
  share of the lowest contribution wage, with the remainder subsidised — *verify
  the current subsidised split and eligibility with NOSI before relying on it.*

### Quick comparison

| Payer | Rate | Base | Who remits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 11% | own insurance wage | employer withholds |
| Employer (per staff member) | 18.75% | each employee's insurance wage | employer |
| Self-employed business owner | 21% | self-chosen contribution wage | the individual |
| Board member / manager in register | 21% | the **maximum** insurance wage | the company |

## Section 3 — Computation

### 3.1 The insurance wage and its bands

Contributions are **not** on full salary without limit. They apply to the
**insurance wage** (الأجر التأميني), which is clamped between the annual minimum
and maximum:

- **2026 minimum:** EGP **2,700** per month
- **2026 maximum:** EGP **16,700** per month

```
insurance_wage = min( max( actual_wage, 2700 ), 16700 )
```

Both caps are **indexed up by 15% each 1 January** under Law 148/2019 (the
mechanism runs through 2028). Historically: 2025 min EGP 2,300 / max EGP 14,500 →
2026 min EGP 2,700 / max EGP 16,700. **Always re-verify the January value for the
current year against NOSI before computing.**

### 3.2 Employee and employer rates

```
employee_contribution = 0.11   × insurance_wage
employer_contribution = 0.1875 × insurance_wage
combined              = 0.2975 × insurance_wage
```

### 3.3 Self-employed comprehensive scheme

```
chosen_wage           = elected by the owner, in [2700, 16700]
self_employed_monthly = 0.21 × chosen_wage
```

### 3.4 Worked bands (2026)

| Insurance wage | Employee 11% | Employer 18.75% | Combined 29.75% | Self-employed 21% |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| EGP 2,700 (min) | 297.00 | 506.25 | 803.25 | 567.00 |
| EGP 8,000 | 880.00 | 1,500.00 | 2,380.00 | 1,680.00 |
| EGP 16,700 (max) | 1,837.00 | 3,131.25 | 4,968.25 | 3,507.00 |

> All figures EGP/month. Note: the self-employed pay **21%** of their *chosen*
> wage — not 29.75% — because the comprehensive scheme uses a single combined rate.

---

## Section 4 — Registration and payment

### Registration with NOSI (التسجيل)

- **Employers:** must register the establishment and each new employee with NOSI
  using the prescribed forms (Form 1 to open the file, Form 2 for new hires, Form 6
  on termination — *verify current form numbers*). New hires must be reported
  promptly to avoid lapses in coverage.
- **Self-employed / business owners:** register **themselves** directly at the
  competent NOSI office (or online portal where available), declaring their
  activity and electing a contribution wage from the reference table.
- Insurance numbers (الرقم التأميني) follow the individual; the national ID
  (الرقم القومي) is the key identifier.

### Payment cadence (سداد الاشتراكات)

- Contributions are due **monthly**.
- Remittance must reach NOSI by the **15th of the month following** the month for
  which contributions are due. Paying on or before the 15th avoids the late charge.
- Employers remit the combined employee + employer amount; self-employed pay their
  own 21%.

### Penalties (غرامات التأخير)

- Late contributions accrue an **additional delay charge** equal to the average
  yield on treasury bills/bonds for the month before payment, **plus 2%**, applied
  until the debt is settled — *verify the exact current formula with NOSI.*
- Failure to register employees or under-declaring wages exposes the employer to
  back-contributions plus the delay charge and possible administrative penalties.

## Section 5 — Worked examples

### Example 1 — Employee on a mid-range salary

A salaried developer earns a fixed monthly wage of EGP 12,000 (within the band).

- Insurance wage = EGP 12,000 (between 2,700 and 16,700).
- Employee share = 11% × 12,000 = **EGP 1,320**.
- Employer share = 18.75% × 12,000 = **EGP 2,250**.
- Combined remitted by employer = **EGP 3,570/month**.

### Example 2 — High earner above the cap

An employee earns EGP 25,000/month.

- Insurance wage is **capped at EGP 16,700** (not 25,000).
- Employee share = 11% × 16,700 = **EGP 1,837**.
- Employer share = 18.75% × 16,700 = **EGP 3,131.25**.
- Salary above EGP 16,700 carries **no** statutory social insurance contribution.

### Example 3 — Self-employed freelancer choosing a mid tier

A freelance graphic designer registers as a self-employed business owner and elects
a contribution wage of EGP 8,000.

- Self-employed contribution = 21% × 8,000 = **EGP 1,680/month**.
- She pays this herself, directly to NOSI, by the 15th of the next month.
- If she instead elected the minimum (EGP 2,700), she would pay 21% × 2,700 =
  **EGP 567/month**; at the maximum (EGP 16,700), **EGP 3,507/month**.

### Example 4 — Owner-manager named in the commercial register

A managing partner whose name is in the company's commercial register is insured as
an **employer**, not a salaried employee.

- Contribution = **21% of the maximum** insurance wage = 21% × 16,700 =
  **EGP 3,507/month**, regardless of the salary actually drawn.
- *Verify whether this flat treatment applies to the specific role and register
  entry with an Egyptian accountant.*

## Section 6 — Tier 2, references, and test suite

### Tier 2 — escalate to a human reviewer when

- The worker's classification is ambiguous (employee vs. business owner vs.
  irregular worker), or their name's presence in the commercial register is unclear.
- The client is an **irregular / informal-economy** worker eligible for the
  subsidised contribution split — confirm eligibility and the current subsidised %.
- Multiple simultaneous capacities exist (e.g. employed **and** running a business)
  — aggregation and cap rules need a reviewer.
- The current-year January min/max or rates cannot be confirmed against NOSI.
- Back-contributions, settlements, or penalty negotiations are involved.
- Foreign nationals / totalization agreements (اتفاقيات التأمين المتبادل) apply.

### References

- Social Insurance and Pensions Law No. **148 of 2019** and its Executive
  Regulations (اللائحة التنفيذية).
- **NOSI** — National Organization for Social Insurance (الهيئة القومية للتأمين
  الاجتماعي). Verify min/max wage and rates each January.
- **PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Egypt, Individual / Other taxes** (employee 11%,
  employer 18.75%, 2026 min EGP 2,700 / max EGP 16,700, board flat 21%).
- **BDO**, **Mercans**, **Fragomen** statutory alerts on the January 2026 insurable
  wage increase.
- Cross-reference: **eg-payroll** (employer remittance + income-tax interaction),
  **egypt-vat** (indirect tax for the same self-employed client).

### Test suite (sanity checks)

| # | Input | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| T1 | Employee, wage EGP 10,000 | employee 1,100; employer 1,875 |
| T2 | Employee, wage EGP 1,500 | clamp to 2,700 → employee 297; employer 506.25 |
| T3 | Employee, wage EGP 30,000 | cap to 16,700 → employee 1,837; employer 3,131.25 |
| T4 | Self-employed, chosen wage EGP 5,000 | 21% × 5,000 = 1,050 |
| T5 | Self-employed, no wage chosen | default to min 2,700 → 567 |
| T6 | Board member in register | 21% × 16,700 = 3,507 |
| T7 | Payment made on the 16th | late — delay charge (T-bill avg + 2%) applies |
| T8 | Asked for 2027 figures | re-verify January 2027 indexed min/max before answering |

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** state the minimum or maximum insurance wage, or the contribution
  rates, as settled fact for any year without re-verifying against NOSI — the caps
  are indexed **+15% every January** and change annually.
- **Do NOT** apply the **11% / 18.75%** employee/employer split to a **self-employed**
  person; the self-employed comprehensive rate is **21%** of a chosen wage.
- **Do NOT** compute contributions on uncapped salary — always clamp to the
  min/max band.
- **Do NOT** treat an owner-manager named in the commercial register as a salaried
  employee; they are insured as an **employer** (flat 21% of the maximum wage).
- **Do NOT** advise on irregular/informal-worker subsidised contributions without
  confirming the current subsidised split and eligibility with NOSI.
- **Do NOT** handle income tax (كسب العمل) withholding, the Martyrs Fund deduction,
  or payroll mechanics here — defer to **eg-payroll**.
- **Do NOT** advise on totalization agreements, expatriate exemptions, or penalty
  settlements without a qualified Egyptian reviewer.
- **Do NOT** file, register, or remit on the client's behalf — produce the
  computation and instructions only.
