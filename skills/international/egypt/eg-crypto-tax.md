# Egypt Cryptocurrency — Legal Status & Tax (العملات المشفرة) Skill v1.0

This skill covers the **regulatory** and **possible tax** treatment of
cryptocurrency (العملات المشفرة / العملات الرقمية) in Egypt for individuals and
small businesses. The AI must reply in the user's language (English or Arabic /
Egyptian Arabic) and may use the native terms shown throughout.

### Conservative defaults (مبادئ احترازية)

When the position is unclear (which is almost always for Egyptian crypto), apply
these defaults:

1. **Legal status first, tax second.** Never discuss tax without first stating
   the regulatory restriction and legal risk. The legal question dominates.
2. **Do not declare crypto legal or safe.** State the restriction plainly.
3. **No definitive tax rate.** There is no settled crypto tax rate in Egypt.
   Refuse to assert one. Present *possibilities*, clearly flagged as uncertain.
4. **If the person already has gains and wants to be compliant**, treat any
   declared income on the *conservative* (higher-tax / fully-taxable) basis and
   route them to a credentialed Egyptian professional rather than guessing.
5. **Escalate to a human.** For any real situation involving money, hand off to
   a qualified Egyptian accountant **and** lawyer. Do not let the user rely on
   this skill alone.

## Section 2 — Regulatory status & legal risk (الوضع القانوني)

### The core rule

Under the **Central Bank and Banking Sector Law No. 194 of 2020** — Egypt's
banking law — **Article 206** prohibits the **issuance, trading, promotion, or
operation of platforms** dealing in cryptocurrencies or "cryptographic units"
**without prior approval (a licence) from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE)**.

The decisive practical fact: **the CBE has not, in general, granted any such
licence.** No crypto exchange or crypto business is known to be CBE-licensed.
The result is that crypto dealing in Egypt is **effectively restricted and
unlicensed** — i.e. carried on outside any legal/regulated framework.

### Penalties

Reported penalties under the framework include **imprisonment** and **fines**,
with figures cited up to the **multi-million EGP** range (sources commonly cite
fines in the hundreds of thousands up to ~EGP 10 million, plus possible
imprisonment). *Exact current penalty figures must be verified against the law
text and a local lawyer — do not quote a precise number as settled.*

### CBE public warnings

The CBE has **repeatedly and publicly warned** the public against dealing in
cryptocurrencies, citing extreme volatility, fraud risk, money-laundering /
terrorist-financing exposure, and — critically — that **Egyptian law gives no
recourse to recover funds lost** in crypto transactions. These warnings have been
issued/renewed on multiple occasions (e.g. statements around 2018 and 2021).

### Religious ruling (fatwa)

Egypt's **Grand Mufti / Dar al-Ifta issued a fatwa (2018) declaring crypto haram
(محرّم)**, citing speculation, uncertainty (gharar), and fraud risk. A fatwa is a
**religious opinion with significant social and moral weight in Egypt — but it is
not itself a statute.** Mention it for context; the binding legal restriction is
Law 194/2020, not the fatwa.

### What this means in practice

- Crypto is **not** a recognised legal currency or a regulated investment asset
  in Egypt.
- Operating an exchange, brokering, promoting, or running a crypto platform in
  Egypt without a (non-existent) CBE licence is **prohibited and penalised**.
- Even an *individual* simply trading crypto operates in a **legally grey-to-
  prohibited zone with real downside risk** and **no legal protection** if funds
  are lost or stolen.
- The honest summary for any user: **"In Egypt, crypto dealing is restricted and
  legally risky. There is no clean, safe, taxed-and-blessed way to do it."**

## Section 3 — Possible income-tax treatment IF gains arise (uncertain)

> **Heavy caveat (تنبيه شديد).** Everything in this section is **conjecture about
> how existing tax law *might* be read** in the absence of a crypto-specific law
> or ETA guidance. **None of it is confirmed. Do not treat any of it as the
> definitive rule, and do not state a definitive rate.**

Egypt has **no specific cryptocurrency tax law** and the ETA provides **no
dedicated section or guidance** for declaring crypto income. There is no
established practice of filing crypto capital gains in Egypt, partly because the
state does not recognise crypto as a legal asset/currency.

If a resident individual nonetheless realises gains from crypto activity and
wants to be tax-compliant, the **general** Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005 (as
amended) is the only framework that *could* be reached. Possible — and competing —
readings include:

1. **Commercial / industrial income (الأرباح التجارية والصناعية).** Frequent,
   organised, profit-seeking trading *might* be argued to be a commercial
   activity, taxed under the normal **progressive personal income tax brackets**
   (see the `eg-income-tax` skill for the current bracket table). This is the
   most likely "conservative" reading for an active trader.

2. **Non-commercial / professional income (إيرادات المهن غير التجارية).** Less
   likely, but conceivable for certain activity patterns.

3. **No clear charging provision at all.** Because crypto is not a recognised
   asset and the activity is itself restricted, it is genuinely unclear whether
   any income-tax charge cleanly attaches, and there is **no general personal
   capital-gains tax** on most assets in Egypt to fall back on.

There is **no settled rate, no recognised cost-basis method, no loss-relief
position, and no filing line** for crypto. **Do not invent one.** Note also the
uncomfortable interaction: declaring crypto income may simultaneously *evidence*
participation in a restricted activity — a point only a **lawyer** can advise on.

**Practical guidance the AI should give:** route the person to a qualified
Egyptian accountant **and** lawyer; if they choose to declare, the conservative
default is to treat realised gains as fully taxable commercial income under the
ordinary brackets and to keep complete records — while understanding the legal
exposure of the underlying activity.

## Section 4 — What we DON'T know / open questions (أسئلة مفتوحة)

Be transparent with the user about every one of these:

- **No crypto-specific statute or ETA circular.** There is no published rule that
  says how (or whether) crypto gains are taxed.
- **Which category, if any** — commercial, non-commercial, "other" — applies is
  unsettled.
- **No confirmed rate** for crypto specifically.
- **Cost basis, FX conversion (USD/USDT → EGP), and timing** of any gain are
  undefined for tax purposes.
- **Losses** — whether deductible or carried forward — undefined.
- **Mining, staking, airdrops, NFTs, DeFi yield, P2P** — no specific treatment;
  arguably even more exposed on the legal side.
- **Interaction with the restriction itself** — whether and how one can declare
  income from a restricted activity is a legal question, not just a tax one.
- **Enforcement reality vs. the letter of the law** — these can diverge, and
  this skill does not assess prosecution likelihood. A lawyer must.
- **Foreign-exchange / capital-controls rules** may also bear on moving funds in
  and out — out of scope here; verify separately.

When asked something covered above, the correct answer is **"this is not
established in Egypt — here is why, and here is who to ask,"** not a guess.

## Section 5 — Worked examples (heavily caveated)

> Every example below is **illustrative only**. They do **not** establish that
> the treatment shown is correct, legal, or safe. They show *how the AI should
> respond*, with the warnings attached.

### Example 1 — "Is Bitcoin legal in Egypt and how is it taxed?"

**Correct response shape:**
- Lead with the legal status: crypto dealing is **restricted/unlicensed** under
  CBE Law 194/2020 (Art. 206); no general CBE licence exists; CBE has warned the
  public repeatedly; a fatwa deems it haram.
- State there is **no specific crypto tax law and no clear ETA guidance** — so no
  definitive tax answer exists.
- Flag the **legal risk** (possible imprisonment/fines) and **no legal recourse**
  if funds are lost.
- Recommend a qualified Egyptian **lawyer and accountant** before doing anything.
- Do **not** quote a tax rate as if settled.

### Example 2 — "I already made a profit trading on a foreign exchange. How much tax do I owe in Egypt?"

**Correct response shape:**
- Acknowledge the situation without endorsing the activity.
- Explain there is **no settled crypto tax rule**; *if* they choose to declare,
  the **conservative** default is to treat the realised gain as taxable
  commercial income under the ordinary personal income-tax brackets (point them
  to `eg-income-tax` for the current bracket table) — **clearly labelled as one
  uncertain interpretation, not the law.**
- Stress that declaring may also surface the **legal-status issue** — a lawyer
  must advise.
- Hand off to a credentialed Egyptian professional. **No firm number.**

### Example 3 — "Can I run a crypto exchange / OTC desk in Egypt?"

**Correct response shape:**
- Direct, unambiguous: operating a crypto platform/brokerage **without a CBE
  licence is prohibited** under Law 194/2020, and such licences are **not
  generally granted** — so this is **effectively not permitted** and carries
  **penalties (imprisonment and fines)**.
- This is a **legal-prohibition** answer, not a tax-planning one. Do **not**
  offer structuring or tax-optimisation advice for a restricted activity.
- Refer to a qualified Egyptian lawyer.

---

## Section 6 — Tier 2 details & references

### Tier 2 — escalate to a human professional when:

- The user has real crypto gains and wants to file (accountant **+** lawyer).
- The user is considering any crypto **business** in Egypt (lawyer first).
- Any question of **enforcement risk, prosecution, or legality** of a specific
  plan (lawyer — outside this skill's competence).
- Cross-border, FX, capital-controls, or AML/CTF angles arise.
- The user wants certainty on a **rate, basis, or filing line** — there is none;
  escalate rather than fabricate.

### References (verify before relying)

- **CBE — Central Bank of Egypt** (cbe.org.eg): Banking Law No. 194 of 2020,
  Art. 206; public warnings against crypto dealing.
- **ETA — Egyptian Tax Authority** (eta.gov.eg): Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005
  (as amended) — the general framework; **no crypto-specific guidance**.
- **PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries** (taxsummaries.pwc.com/egypt) — general Egyptian
  tax background.
- **Dar al-Ifta / Grand Mufti** — 2018 fatwa (religious opinion, not law).
- Companion skills: `eg-income-tax` (brackets, filing), `eg-bookkeeping`,
  `egypt-vat`, `income-tax-workflow-base`.

## PROHIBITIONS (محظورات)

The AI must **NEVER**:

- **Never present crypto dealing as legal, permitted, or safe in Egypt.** It is
  restricted/unlicensed under CBE Law 194/2020 and carries real legal risk.
- **Never assert a definitive crypto tax rate or filing treatment** for Egypt —
  none is settled; saying "you pay X%" is wrong and harmful.
- **Never encourage** dealing in, promoting, or operating crypto in Egypt, or
  offer structuring/tax-optimisation advice for a restricted activity.
- **Never imply the fatwa is the binding law** (the statute is) — or that the
  *absence* of a tax rule means crypto gains are tax-free or risk-free.
- **Never let the user rely on this skill alone** for a real decision — always
  route to a qualified Egyptian lawyer and accountant.
- **Never claim Egypt has no recourse problem solved, or that funds are
  protected** — the CBE warns there is no legal recourse for losses.

specific crypto tax law and no clear ETA guidance**. This material is
**informational only** — it is **not** legal, tax, or financial advice, and it is
**not** encouragement to deal in crypto. Anyone with a real situation must
**consult a qualified Egyptian lawyer and accountant** before acting. Figures,
penalties, and any tax position must be re-verified against the CBE, the ETA, and
reputable sources at the time of use. Provided by the Open Accountants Community —
