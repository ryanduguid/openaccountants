# Egypt — Simplified / SME Tax Regime (Law No. 6 of 2025 + Law No. 152 of 2020)

This skill covers Egypt's turnover-based **integrated simplified tax system**
(النظام الضريبي المتكامل المبسط) introduced by **Law No. 6 of 2025**, plus the
underlying **MSME Development Law No. 152 of 2020** (قانون تنمية المشروعات
المتوسطة والصغيرة ومتناهية الصغر). It is written for small self-employed people,
freelancers, professionals (أصحاب المهن الحرة), sole proprietors, and small
companies whose annual turnover does not exceed **EGP 20 million**.

> Respond in the user's language. If the user writes in Arabic, reply in Arabic
> and keep the native legal terms (e.g. رقم الأعمال = turnover, الإقرار الضريبي =
> tax return, مصلحة الضرائب المصرية = Egyptian Tax Authority).

| Eligibility | Annual turnover ≤ **EGP 20,000,000** (whether or not registered for tax) |
| Tax basis | **% of annual turnover** (not net profit) — 0.4% to 1.5% by band |
| Currency | EGP (Egyptian Pound) |

| Effective date | Law No. 6 of 2025: published 12 Feb 2025, effective **1 March 2025** |
| Commitment | Locked into the regime for **5 years** from the request date |
| Quality tier | **Research-verified — pending sign-off by an Egyptian accountant** |
| Version | 1.0 |

### Turnover-band income tax rates (Law No. 6 of 2025)

The income tax is a flat percentage of **annual turnover** (إجمالي رقم الأعمال
السنوي), not taxable profit. The band is determined by the year's turnover.

| Annual turnover (EGP) | Income tax rate (% of turnover) |
|---|---|
| Less than 500,000 | **0.4%** |
| 500,000 to less than 2,000,000 | **0.5%** |
| 2,000,000 to less than 3,000,000 | **0.75%** |
| 3,000,000 to less than 10,000,000 | **1.0%** |
| 10,000,000 to less than 20,000,000 | **1.5%** |

> Rates corroborated across multiple Big-4 / law-firm alerts (EY, WTS, and
> Egyptian law firms). **Verify the current band rates against ETA and the
> Executive Regulations before filing**, as Executive Regulations and ministerial
> decrees can refine bands.

### Conservative defaults

When information is missing, assume the **less favourable** position and tell the
user to confirm:

1. **Default to the general income-tax system** unless the user confirms they
   have formally applied to and been accepted into the Law 6/2025 regime. The
   regime is opt-in by request — it is not automatic.
2. **Default to the higher band** if turnover is near a band boundary.
3. **Assume VAT registration is still required** at the standard EGP 500,000
   registration threshold — Law 6/2025 simplifies VAT *filing frequency*, it does
   not abolish VAT.
4. **Assume e-invoicing / e-receipt compliance is mandatory** to keep the
   incentives.
5. **Assume the 5-year lock-in applies** once enrolled — do not advise the user
   they can freely exit.
6. **Never compute a final liability without a credentialed Egyptian accountant
   sign-off.** This skill is research-verified, not authority-certified.

## 2. Eligibility & Enrolment

### Who can join the Law 6/2025 simplified system

- Any **project / activity** — commercial, industrial, service, or **professional
  (مهنة حرة)** — including freelancers and sole proprietors.
- **Annual turnover must not exceed EGP 20 million.**
- Applies **whether or not the person is already registered** for tax (the law
  explicitly targets the informal sector / غير المسجلين to bring them in).
- Companies as well as natural persons qualify, subject to the same turnover cap.

### How to enrol (via ETA)

1. Register / update registration with the **Egyptian Tax Authority** (eta.gov.eg).
2. Submit a **formal request to benefit** from Law 6/2025 (طلب الانتفاع بأحكام
   القانون) through the ETA portal.
3. Integrate with ETA **electronic systems** — e-invoice (الفاتورة الإلكترونية)
   and/or e-receipt (الإيصال الإلكتروني) as applicable.
4. Maintain simplified books and file the special simplified returns on time.

Once accepted, the taxpayer is **committed for 5 years** counting from the day
after the request is submitted — withdrawal before then is generally **not
permitted**.

### Relationship to Law No. 152 of 2020 (MSME definitions)

Law 152/2020 is the **development / classification** law; it defines enterprise
size by turnover (and by capital for newly incorporated firms). Indicative
turnover bands under Law 152/2020:

- **Micro (متناهية الصغر):** turnover < EGP 1 million.
- **Small (صغيرة):** turnover EGP 1 million to < EGP 50 million (industrial/service
  classification varies).
- **Medium (متوسطة):** turnover EGP 50 million up to EGP 200 million.

> **Verify the current Law 152/2020 size bands** — they were set by executive
> decree and have been updated. Law 152/2020 grants development incentives and
> registration with the MSME Development Agency (جهاز تنمية المشروعات); the
> *turnover tax* itself flows from **Law 6/2025**. The two operate together: the
> tax simplification (Law 6) targets the ≤ EGP 20m segment that overlaps the
> micro/small categories under Law 152.

### Refusal catalogue

Refuse or escalate (do **not** silently produce a number) in these cases:

- **R-EG-1 — Over threshold.** Turnover exceeds EGP 20m (outside the growth
  cushion). The taxpayer belongs in the general system; refuse to apply turnover
  rates.
- **R-EG-2 — Artificial fragmentation.** The user appears to have split one
  business into several entities to stay under EGP 20m. The law excludes this;
  refuse and warn it is an abuse risk (تجزئة المشروع).
- **R-EG-3 — Client-concentration exclusion.** Consultancy / professional
  arrangements where ~90%+ of revenue comes from one or two clients may be
  excluded (anti-disguised-employment). Flag and require verification.
- **R-EG-4 — Not enrolled.** The user has not submitted the request to benefit.
  Do not apply the regime; default to the general system.
- **R-EG-5 — Mid-commitment exit request.** User wants to leave within 5 years.
  Explain the lock-in; do not assume they can exit.
- **R-EG-6 — Out-of-scope taxpayer.** Free zones, special economic zones, oil &
  gas, banks/insurance, or entities barred by sector rules. Refuse and refer to a
  credentialed Egyptian accountant.
- **R-EG-7 — Prior-year liabilities / open audits.** Settlement of past dues and
  the "waiver" provisions have their own deadlines and conditions; refuse to opine
  on amnesty without ETA confirmation.
- **R-EG-8 — No credentialed sign-off.** Always required before filing — never
  present output as final.

## 3. Turnover-band Rates & What Taxes Are Replaced / Exempted

### The core mechanic

Income tax under the regime = **turnover × band rate** (see §1 table). There is
**no profit computation, no depreciation schedule, no expense substantiation** for
the income-tax charge — the rate already embeds an assumed margin. This is the
main attraction: predictability and almost no accounting overhead.

### Taxes / charges exempted or removed for the enrolled taxpayer

Under Law 6/2025, qualifying enterprises are relieved from a bundle of taxes and
fees, reported consistently across Big-4 and law-firm alerts:

- **Stamp duty (ضريبة الدمغة)** on the enterprise's contracts/instruments.
- **State Financial Resources Development Fee (رسم تنمية موارد الدولة).**
- **Notarisation / registration fees** for articles of association and contracts.
- **Capital gains tax** on the sale of machinery, equipment, and fixed assets.
- **Tax on dividends (ضريبة الأرباح الموزعة)** distributed within the regime.
- **Withholding tax (الخصم تحت حساب الضريبة) and advance-payment systems** at
  source — the enterprise is taken out of these collection mechanisms.

### Growth cushion (تجاوز الحد)

- If turnover exceeds EGP 20m **once** within the 5-year window by **no more than
  20%**, the enterprise keeps the benefit at the **1.5% band for one additional
  year**.
- If the excess is **above 20%**, or the threshold is breached **repeatedly**, all
  reduced-tax benefits are **revoked from the following year** and the taxpayer
  moves to the general system.

### Audit / inspection deferral

Income tax and VAT returns of an enrolled enterprise are **not inspected
(audited) until 5 years** have passed from the request date, provided the
taxpayer stays compliant. This is a major compliance relief, not a permanent
exemption.

## 4. Simplified VAT & Filing Under the Regime

The regime simplifies **filing cadence**, not the existence of the taxes.

| Return | Standard system | Under Law 6/2025 |
|---|---|---|
| VAT (ضريبة القيمة المضافة) | Monthly | **Quarterly** — filed within one month after the quarter-end, with payment |
| Income tax (ضريبة الدخل) | Annual, profit-based, complex | **Annual simplified return** on a special template, turnover-based |
| Payroll / wage tax (ضريبة كسب العمل) | Monthly remittance + reconciliation | Obligation limited to the **annual settlement declaration** plus remittance |
| Withholding tax | Periodic | **Removed** (enterprise taken out of the WHT/advance-payment system) |

Key VAT points:

- **VAT registration still applies** at the general turnover threshold
  (**EGP 500,000** — verify current value). Law 6/2025 changes *how often* you
  file, not whether you must register.
- Standard VAT rate in Egypt is **14%** (verify current; certain goods/services
  have special rates such as the 5% machinery rate or the schedule/table-tax
  items). The simplified regime does **not** change VAT *rates*.
- **E-invoicing / e-receipt** integration is a precondition for staying in the
  regime — non-compliance can forfeit the incentives.

> Confirm the **VAT registration threshold (EGP 500,000)** and the **14% standard
> rate** against the current VAT Law (Law 67/2016 as amended) and ETA before
> relying on them.

## 5. When the Simplified Regime Beats the General System

Because the turnover tax is charged on **gross turnover** regardless of profit, it
favours **high-margin, low-cost** activities (typical of freelancers and
professionals) and can hurt **low-margin, high-cost** activities.

### Break-even logic

Compare:

- **Simplified tax** = Turnover × band rate (e.g. 0.5% for a EGP 1.5m freelancer).
- **General income tax** = Net profit × progressive personal income tax rate
  (top brackets reach roughly the high-20s/30s percent — **verify current 2026
  brackets**, which were widened by the 2025 reforms).

The simplified regime wins whenever:

```
Turnover × band_rate  <  Net_profit × effective_general_rate
```

Rearranging, the simplified regime is cheaper when your **net margin** exceeds:

```
break-even margin  ≈  band_rate / effective_general_rate
```

Because band rates are tiny (0.4%–1.5%) and the general top rate is large, the
break-even margin is **very low** — for most genuinely profitable freelancers and
small service businesses, the simplified regime is dramatically cheaper.

The general system can still win when:

- The business runs at a **loss or near-zero margin** (turnover tax is payable
  even on a loss; income tax on a loss is nil and losses may carry forward).
- The business has **very high deductible costs** (e.g. trading/reselling with
  thin markups), making the effective profit-based charge lower than 0.4%–1.5% of
  turnover.
- The taxpayer values **loss carry-forward** and capital allowances that the
  simplified flat charge ignores.

Always weigh the **non-tax benefits**: no audit for 5 years, no WHT/advance
payments, quarterly (not monthly) VAT, exemptions from stamp duty / development
fee / capital gains / dividends — these reduce cost and friction even when the
headline tax is close.

> Remember the **5-year lock-in (§2)**: a taxpayer who expects to scale past
> EGP 20m soon, or to swing into losses, should model multiple years before
> committing.

## 6. Worked Examples

> All figures illustrative. Confirm bands, rates, and the user's enrolment status
> before relying on any number. Verify the 2026 general income-tax brackets.

### Example 1 — Freelance software developer (high margin)

- Turnover: **EGP 1,500,000**; costs: EGP 150,000; net profit: EGP 1,350,000.
- Band: 500k–<2m → **0.5%**.
- **Simplified income tax** = 1,500,000 × 0.5% = **EGP 7,500**.
- General system (illustrative ~25% effective on EGP 1,350,000) ≈ **EGP 337,500**.
- **Simplified wins overwhelmingly.** Plus quarterly VAT, no WHT, 5-year no-audit.

### Example 2 — Small consultancy near the top band

- Turnover: **EGP 12,000,000**; net profit ~EGP 4,000,000.
- Band: 10m–<20m → **1.5%**.
- **Simplified income tax** = 12,000,000 × 1.5% = **EGP 180,000**.
- General system (illustrative ~22.5% on EGP 4m) ≈ **EGP 900,000**.
- **Simplified still wins** by a wide margin given the healthy margin.
- **R-EG-3 check:** if 90%+ of that EGP 12m comes from one client, the consultancy
  may be **excluded** — flag before proceeding.

### Example 3 — Low-margin reseller (general system may win)

- Turnover: **EGP 9,000,000**; net profit only **EGP 200,000** (thin 2.2% margin).
- Band: 3m–<10m → **1.0%**.
- **Simplified income tax** = 9,000,000 × 1.0% = **EGP 90,000**.
- General system (illustrative ~20% effective on EGP 200,000) ≈ **EGP 40,000**.
- **General system is cheaper here** — turnover tax punishes the thin margin.
  Recommend modelling both and getting accountant sign-off before enrolling.

### Example 4 — Growth-cushion breach

- Year 3 turnover spikes to **EGP 22,000,000** (10% over EGP 20m), first breach.
- Within the 20% tolerance and a single event → keeps **1.5% band for one more
  year**: tax ≈ 22,000,000 × 1.5% = **EGP 330,000**.
- If next year turnover hits EGP 26m (30% over) → benefits **revoked from the
  following year**; move to the general system. Apply **R-EG-1**.

### Example 5 — Micro freelancer (lowest band)

- Turnover: **EGP 400,000**; net profit EGP 360,000.
- Band: <500k → **0.4%**.
- **Simplified income tax** = 400,000 × 0.4% = **EGP 1,600**.
- Note VAT registration threshold (EGP 500,000 — verify) is not yet crossed, so
  VAT registration may not be required. Income-tax personal exemptions under the
  general system might also produce a low charge — compare and confirm.

## 7. Tier 2 + Reference + Test Suite

### Tier 2 — escalate to a credentialed Egyptian accountant when

- Turnover is within ~10% of any band boundary or of the EGP 20m cap.
- The activity may be excluded (client concentration, fragmentation, regulated
  sector). See R-EG-2, R-EG-3, R-EG-6.
- There are prior-year liabilities, open audits, or amnesty/settlement questions
  (R-EG-7).
- The taxpayer is considering exit within the 5-year lock-in (R-EG-5).
- Cross-border income, free-zone/SEZ status, or non-resident issues arise.
- VAT registration status, schedule-tax (table-tax) items, or special VAT rates
  are involved.

### Reference (verify each before filing)

- **Law No. 6 of 2025** — integrated simplified tax system; published Official
  Gazette 12 Feb 2025, effective 1 March 2025. Plus its **Executive Regulations**
  and any ETA implementing decrees.
- **Law No. 152 of 2020** — MSME Development Law (size definitions; development
  incentives via جهاز تنمية المشروعات).
- **Income Tax Law No. 91 of 2005** (as amended) — the general system.
- **VAT Law No. 67 of 2016** (as amended) — VAT rate (14%) and registration
  threshold (EGP 500,000) — **verify current values**.
- **Egyptian Tax Authority — eta.gov.eg** — portal, enrolment request,
  e-invoicing/e-receipt, return templates.
- Corroborating professional commentary used for this skill: EY Global tax alert,
  WTS, and Egyptian law-firm alerts (2025).

### Test suite (self-checks)

1. Q: Freelancer with EGP 1.2m turnover — which band? → **0.5%** (500k–<2m).
2. Q: EGP 2.5m turnover band? → **0.75%** (2m–<3m).
3. Q: EGP 8m turnover band? → **1.0%** (3m–<10m).
4. Q: EGP 15m turnover band? → **1.5%** (10m–<20m).
5. Q: EGP 25m turnover, second breach — eligible? → **No**, apply R-EG-1.
6. Q: Is the tax on profit or turnover? → **Turnover** (gross رقم الأعمال).
7. Q: How often is VAT filed in the regime? → **Quarterly**.
8. Q: Can the taxpayer leave after 2 years? → **No** — 5-year lock-in (R-EG-5).
9. Q: Is dividend tax due on distributions within the regime? → **No** (exempted).
10. Q: Is enrolment automatic? → **No** — must submit a request to ETA (R-EG-4).
11. Q: Low-margin reseller, 2% margin, EGP 9m — does simplified always win? →
    **No**, compare with the general system (Example 3).
12. Q: 90% of revenue from one client — proceed? → **Flag R-EG-3** (exclusion
    risk), escalate.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Do NOT** present any tax figure as final or filed without sign-off from a
  qualified Egyptian accountant (محاسب قانوني / EGP-credentialed tax advisor).
- **Do NOT** assume a taxpayer is in the Law 6/2025 regime — confirm they have
  submitted and had accepted the request to benefit.
- **Do NOT** advise structuring or splitting a business to stay under EGP 20m
  (fragmentation is excluded and is an abuse risk — R-EG-2).
- **Do NOT** tell a taxpayer they can freely exit before 5 years.
- **Do NOT** treat the turnover tax as covering VAT, payroll tax, or registration
  obligations — those still exist (with simplified cadence).
- **Do NOT** apply the regime to over-threshold, regulated-sector, or
  free-zone/SEZ taxpayers (R-EG-6).
- **Do NOT** quote rates, thresholds, the VAT rate, or income-tax brackets as
  settled without verifying against ETA and the Executive Regulations — flag
  anything unconfirmed with "verify current value".
- **Do NOT** opine on amnesty/settlement of prior-year dues without ETA
  confirmation (R-EG-7).
