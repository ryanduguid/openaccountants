---

## Section 3 -- How Ennakkovero Is Calculated

### 3.1 Basis of Calculation

Verohallinto calculates ennakkovero based on:

1. **Prior year final assessment** -- If you filed a tax return for the prior year, Verohallinto uses that as the baseline and adjusts for inflation and any known changes.
2. **Estimated income** -- For new entrepreneurs, you provide an estimate of expected annual income and expenses to Verohallinto via OmaVero.
3. **Taxpayer request** -- You can request a change at any time during the year if your income projection changes.

### 3.2 Components Included

The prepayment covers all taxes on business and other non-withheld income:

| Component | Included |
|---|---|
| State income tax (progressive rates) | Yes |
| Municipal tax (kunnallisvero) | Yes |
| Church tax (if applicable) | Yes |
| Health insurance contributions | Yes |
| Capital income tax (30%/34%) | Yes, on estimated capital income portion |
| YEL pension contributions | No -- paid separately to pension insurance company |
| VAT | No -- separate system |

### 3.3 New Entrepreneurs

- Register for prepayment via OmaVero or contact Verohallinto
- Provide estimated annual revenue and expenses
- Verohallinto issues a prepayment decision (ennakkoveropäätös) with amounts and due dates
- If no estimate provided, Verohallinto may set prepayments based on industry averages

---

## Section 4 -- Payment Schedule

### 4.1 Standard Schedule

Prepayments are divided into instalments across the tax year. The number of instalments depends on the total amount:

| Total Annual Ennakkovero | Number of Instalments | Typical Due Dates |
|---|---|---|
| Under €170 | 1 instalment | March |
| €170 -- €500 | 2 instalments | March and September |
| Over €500 | Up to 12 monthly instalments | 23rd of each month (or next business day) |

Most self-employed with meaningful income pay monthly instalments, typically due on the 23rd of each month.

### 4.2 Payment Methods

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| OmaVero | View amounts, due dates, and pay directly |
| Bank transfer | Using the reference number from OmaVero / prepayment decision |
| Direct debit (suoramaksu) | Can be set up via OmaVero for automatic monthly payments |
| e-Invoice | Available through some banks |

## Section 5 -- Adjusting Prepayments During the Year

### 5.1 When to Adjust

- Income significantly higher or lower than estimated
- Business started or ceased mid-year
- Major deductible expense occurred (e.g., large equipment purchase)
- Change in municipality or church membership
- YEL income changed significantly

### 5.2 How to Adjust

1. Log in to OmaVero
2. Navigate to "Prepayment tax" (Ennakkovero)
3. Submit a new estimate of annual income and expenses
4. Verohallinto recalculates and issues a revised prepayment decision
5. Remaining instalments are adjusted; already-paid amounts are credited
6. No fee or penalty for requesting an adjustment

### 5.3 Important Notes

- Adjustments can be made multiple times during the year
- Reducing prepayments too aggressively may result in residual tax + interest
- Increasing prepayments voluntarily is always possible
- Changes typically take effect within a few business days

---

## Section 6 -- Residual Tax and Refunds

### 6.1 After Filing

After the annual tax return is filed and assessed (typically by October-November):

| Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Prepayments < final tax liability | Residual tax (jäännösvero) is due |
| Prepayments > final tax liability | Tax refund (veronpalautus) is issued |
| Prepayments = final tax liability | No further action |

### 6.2 Residual Tax (Jäännösvero)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Notification | Via OmaVero and/or mail |
| Payment deadline | Typically December of the assessment year or February of the following year (in two instalments if >€170) |
| Interest | Late payment interest at base rate + 7 percentage points (Verohallinto publishes the annual rate) |
| Penalty-free threshold | Minor residual tax (under certain limits) may not incur interest |

### 6.3 Tax Refund (Veronpalautus)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Timing | Typically paid in August-December of the year following the tax year |
| Method | Direct deposit to bank account registered in OmaVero |
| Interest on refund | Verohallinto pays a small credit interest on overpaid amounts |

---

## Section 7 -- Penalties for Underpayment

| Situation | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Insufficient prepayments (honest estimate) | Residual tax + interest at prescribed rate |
| No prepayment registration at all | Verohallinto may impose prepayments retrospectively; penalty interest applies |
| Deliberate underestimation | Tax increase (veronkorotus) of 2-10% on additional tax may apply |
| Late payment of instalment | Interest accrues from due date; persistent non-payment may lead to enforcement (ulosotto) |

---

## Section 8 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Standard Annual Cycle

**Situation:** Freelance designer, second year of business. Prior year final tax was €12,000.

1. **January:** Verohallinto issues 2025 prepayment decision based on 2024 final tax. Monthly instalments of ~€1,000, due 23rd of each month.
2. **June:** Business is slower than expected. Designer estimates 2025 income will be 30% lower. Submits adjustment via OmaVero.
3. **July:** Revised decision: remaining monthly instalments reduced to ~€583.
4. **April 2026:** Files 2025 tax return showing final tax of €9,500.
5. **Assessment:** Total prepayments made = €8,498 (6 × €1,000 + 6 × €583). Residual tax = €1,002, due in two instalments.

### Example 2 -- First-Year Entrepreneur

**Situation:** Software consultant starts business in March 2025. Estimates €50,000 gross revenue, €10,000 expenses.

1. **March:** Registers for ennakkovero via OmaVero. Provides estimate: net income €40,000.
2. **March:** Verohallinto issues prepayment decision: approximately €10,000-€12,000 total for the year, payable in 10 monthly instalments (March-December).
3. **Filing 2026:** Actual net income was €45,000. Small residual tax due.

## Section 9 -- Interaction with Other Taxes

| System | Interaction |
|---|---|
| Employer withholding (ennakonpidätys) | If self-employed person also has employment income, employer withholding reduces the amount of ennakkovero needed |
| YEL pension insurance | Paid separately; not included in ennakkovero but is tax-deductible |
| VAT (ALV) | Completely separate system; VAT payments and refunds do not affect ennakkovero |
| Municipal tax | Included in ennakkovero calculation |
