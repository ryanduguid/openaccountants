## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-MT-F1 -- Shell company request.** "This skill will not assist in forming a company with no genuine economic substance in Malta. Shell structures without real operations, employees, or premises may violate AML regulations and expose founders to criminal liability. Escalate to a licensed legal practitioner."

**R-MT-F2 -- Nominee structures without substance.** "Using nominee directors and shareholders to obscure beneficial ownership without legitimate business purpose is a red flag under Malta's PMLA. Beneficial ownership must always be disclosed to the MBR. Refuse to proceed if the client's stated purpose is to hide ownership."

**R-MT-F3 -- Regulated activity without licensing.** "If the business involves financial services, gaming, crypto, insurance, or investment management, MFSA licensing is required before operations commence. Formation alone is insufficient. Escalate to a regulated-sector specialist."

**R-MT-F4 -- Insufficient capital for the business plan.** "While the legal minimum is €1,165, banks and counterparties may refuse to deal with undercapitalised entities. Flag if the proposed capital is clearly insufficient for the stated business activity."

## Section 10 -- Timeline

| Step | Duration | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| Name availability check | 1 day | Day 1 |
| Draft memorandum and articles | 2--5 days | Day 3--6 |
| Open bank account and deposit capital | 1--3 weeks | Day 10--27 |
| File with MBR (electronic) | 1 day | Day 11--28 |
| MBR review and certificate of registration | 1--3 days | Day 12--31 |
| Tax registration (CFR) | 1--5 days | Day 13--36 |
| VAT registration | 1--5 days | Day 14--41 |
| Employer registration (if needed) | 1--3 days | Day 15--44 |
| **Ready to trade** | | **~3--6 weeks** |

The bottleneck is typically the bank account opening, especially for non-resident founders.
