### FSS Computation Method

Monthly tax = (Cumulative gross emoluments x Rate - Subtract) / 12, adjusted cumulatively. The employer applies the rate table to projected annual income, divides by 12, then adjusts month-by-month to ensure smooth withholding. No separate Grundfreibetrag exists -- the 0% band IS the tax-free allowance.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions

Employee SSC is Class 1, computed weekly on the basic weekly wage at 10%, subject to caps.

### Class 1 Employee SSC Rates (2026)

| Category | Who | Weekly Rate | Max Weekly | Annual Max |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A | Under 18, wage ≤ EUR 229.44 | EUR 6.62 flat | EUR 6.62 | EUR 344.24 |
| B | Age 18+, wage ≤ EUR 229.44 | EUR 22.94 flat (or 10%) | EUR 22.94 | EUR 1,192.88 |
| C1 (born ≤ 1961) | Wage EUR 229.45 -- 490.38 | 10% of basic weekly wage | -- | -- |
| D1 (born ≤ 1961) | Wage ≥ EUR 490.39 | EUR 49.04 | EUR 49.04 | EUR 2,550.08 |
| C2 (born ≥ 1962) | Wage EUR 229.45 -- 559.30 | 10% of basic weekly wage | -- | -- |
| D2 (born ≥ 1962) | Wage ≥ EUR 559.31 | EUR 55.93 | EUR 55.93 | EUR 2,908.36 |

For monthly-paid employees, convert to weekly equivalent: monthly salary x 12 / 52.

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions

Employer SSC mirrors employee SSC exactly -- 10% of basic weekly wage with identical caps. The employer also pays the Maternity Trust Fund levy.

### Employer Contributions (2026)

| Contribution | Rate | Ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Class 1 SSC (employer) | 10% of basic weekly wage | Same caps as employee (D2: EUR 55.93/week) | Matches employee pound-for-pound |
| Maternity Trust Fund | 0.30% of basic weekly wage | Follows SSC wage bands | Max EUR 1.68/week (D2 category) |

**Total employer cost per high-earning employee (born ≥ 1962):** EUR 55.93 SSC + EUR 1.68 Maternity = EUR 57.61 per week (EUR 2,995.72/year).

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (FSS + SSC) | **This skill (malta-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed income tax (TA24/TA22) | malta-income-tax.md |
| Self-employed SSC (Class 2) | malta-ssc.md |
| Malta VAT returns | malta-vat-return.md |
| Malta bookkeeping | malta-bookkeeping.md |
| Employer corporate tax | malta-corporate-tax.md |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages, employer SSC, and Maternity Fund are expenses; FSS tax and employee SSC are liabilities until remitted.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** The FS3 annual statement feeds into the employee's personal TA24 return. Employment income goes to Box 4 if the employee is also self-employed.
- **Payroll → SSC:** Class 1 contributions paid through payroll count toward the employee's pension entitlement. Separate from Class 2 (self-employed).

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER process payroll without a valid FS4 status declaration from the employee
- NEVER apply single rates to a married employee or vice versa without confirming FS4 status
- NEVER compute SSC on total remuneration -- use basic weekly wage only (exclude overtime premiums, bonuses above basic)
- NEVER forget the Maternity Trust Fund levy on top of employer SSC
- NEVER pay COLA as taxable income -- it is tax-exempt
- NEVER omit statutory bonuses (Government Bonus + Weekly Allowance) from payroll
- NEVER issue a payslip missing any of the mandatory fields under LN 274/2018
- NEVER miss the FS5 deadline (15 days after month-end) -- penalties apply
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a warranted accountant
