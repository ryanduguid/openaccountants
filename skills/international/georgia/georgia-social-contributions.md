description: >
  Use this skill whenever asked about social contributions, social security, or the mandatory funded pension in the country of Georgia (GE — Tbilisi, Caucasus; NOT the U.S. state of Georgia). Trigger on phrases like "Georgia pension contribution", "funded pension 2%", "Georgia social security", "do I pay social contributions in Georgia", "pension agency Georgia", "Georgia payroll withholding", "Georgia PIT 20%", "Georgia employer on-cost", "Georgia salary net pay", "saპensio / sapensio fund", "state co-contribution Georgia", or any question about employment-based social-insurance levies for a Georgian employer or employee. Also trigger when classifying bank statement transactions involving the Pension Agency (LEPL Pension Fund), Revenue Service of Georgia (rs.ge), unified monthly income-tax declaration debits, or PIT withholding from Georgian banks (TBC, Bank of Georgia, Liberty Bank). CRITICAL: Georgia (the country) has NO classic social-security/health/unemployment payroll system — the only mandatory employment social-insurance levy is the funded pension (2% employee + 2% employer + tiered state co-contribution). This skill covers the funded pension rates and tiers, mandatory/voluntary participation, flat 20% PIT withholding, monthly compliance, bank-statement classification, and edge cases. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Georgia social-contribution or payroll work.

# Georgia (Country) Social Contributions & Funded Pension Skill v0.1

> **JURISDICTION WARNING.** This skill is for **Georgia the country** (GE — capital Tbilisi, ISO `GE`, currency GEL). It is **NOT** for the U.S. state of Georgia. Search engines and training data heavily conflate the two. If a client mentions USD, the IRS, Atlanta, or a U.S. SSN, STOP — this is the wrong skill.

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Georgia (the country, Caucasus) — ISO `GE` |
| Currency | GEL (Georgian lari) only |
| Primary Legislation (pension) | Law of Georgia "On Funded Pension", effective 1 January 2019 (matsne doc. 4280127) |
| Primary Legislation (PIT) | Tax Code of Georgia (income tax / payroll withholding) |
| Pension Authority | Pension Agency of Georgia — LEPL Pension Fund (pensions.ge) |
| Tax Authority (PIT) | Revenue Service of Georgia (rs.ge) |
| Classic social security (health/unemployment) | **NONE** — Georgia has no payroll-tax-funded social-security system (PwC, Individual — Other taxes) |
| Funded pension — employee | 2% of taxable gross salary (matsne 4280127) |
| Funded pension — employer | 2% of taxable gross salary (matsne 4280127) |
| Funded pension — state co-contribution | 2% up to GEL 24,000 annual income; 1% from GEL 24,000–60,000; 0% above GEL 60,000 (matsne 4280127; PwC) |
| Funded pension — self-employed (opt-in) | 4% of income, voluntary (matsne 4280127; PwC) |
| Personal income tax (PIT) | Flat **20%**, no brackets, withheld at source (PwC, Individual — Taxes on personal income) |
| Tax year | Calendar year (PwC, Individual — Tax administration) |
| Monthly declaration deadline | 15th day of the month following the salary-payment month (PwC, Corporate — Tax administration) |
| Pension transfer deadline | No later than the 15th of the month following the salary-payment month (F-Chain, 1 May 2025 rules) |
| Annual individual return | Due 1 April of the following year (income not taxed at source) (PwC, Individual — Tax administration) |
| Late-payment interest | 0.05% of the unpaid amount per overdue day (Tax Code of Georgia; PwC/GSL) |
| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by a qualified Georgian tax adviser |
| Validation date | Pending |

**Funded pension contribution stack (the ONLY mandatory employment social-insurance levy):**

| Annual taxable income band | Employee | Employer | State | Total credited to individual account |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Up to GEL 24,000 | 2% | 2% | 2% | **6%** |
| GEL 24,000 – 60,000 (portion in band) | 2% | 2% | 1% | **5%** |
| Above GEL 60,000 (portion in band) | 2% | 2% | 0% | **4%** |

Arithmetic check: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6; 2 + 2 + 1 = 5; 2 + 2 + 0 = 4. Source: matsne 4280127; PwC Individual — Other taxes.

> **NOTE on tiers.** Employee and employer each pay a flat 2% on the **full** taxable salary — there is no upper ceiling on the 2%+2% portion. Only the **state** share is income-tiered/capped (matsne 4280127). The GEL 24,000 / 60,000 thresholds apply to **annual** income; whether they are applied per-month-prorated or reconciled annually is **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against rs.ge guidance]**.

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Employee age / enactment-status unknown | Treat as MANDATORY participant (under 60 / women under 55) — apply 2% employee + 2% employer on full taxable salary (matsne 4280127) |
| State co-contribution share uncertain | Apply 2% only up to GEL 24,000, 1% from 24,000–60,000, ZERO above 60,000 — never assume a state top-up above GEL 60,000 |
| Self-employed participation unknown | Treat as VOLUNTARY / OFF by default; apply 4% only if the individual has elected in (matsne 4280127) |
| Any health / unemployment / "social security" payroll levy | Do NOT model one — none exists in Georgia (PwC) |
| Currency unstated | Assume GEL; if USD/IRS appears, STOP — wrong jurisdiction |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- confirmation that the engagement concerns **Georgia the country** (not the U.S. state), the employee's taxable gross monthly salary in GEL, and whether the worker is an employee or self-employed.

**Recommended** -- employee's age at the law's entry into force (1 Jan 2019) / current age, annual taxable income (to apply the state co-contribution tiers), and whether the employee has opted out (age-40+ window) or is in the voluntary-only group (60/55+ at enactment).

**Ideal** -- payroll register, the unified monthly income-tax declaration filed with rs.ge, Pension Agency statement of individual account, and bank statements showing PIT and pension transfers.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-GE-SC-1 -- Wrong Georgia (U.S. state).** *Trigger:* references to USD, the IRS, Atlanta, a U.S. SSN, or "Georgia state income tax." *Message:* "This skill covers the country of Georgia (GE). For the U.S. state of Georgia, use a U.S. state payroll skill — do not apply these rates."

**R-GE-SC-2 -- Pension arrears / historical contributions.** *Trigger:* unpaid pension contributions from prior periods. *Message:* "Late pension/PIT amounts accrue 0.05% per overdue day under the Tax Code of Georgia, and specific declaration fines apply. Do not quantify arrears without a Revenue Service / Pension Agency statement. Escalate to a qualified Georgian adviser."

**R-GE-SC-3 -- Participation-status edge cases.** *Trigger:* employee near the 60/55 age boundary, claiming an opt-out, or a returning/re-enrolling participant. *Message:* "Mandatory vs voluntary participation and the age-40+ opt-out window (3–5 months after joining) are case-specific. Confirm the worker's status with the Pension Agency before computing. Escalate to a reviewer."

**R-GE-SC-4 -- Expat / treaty / totalisation questions.** *Trigger:* foreign worker, social-security totalisation, or treaty relief. *Message:* "Georgia has no classic social-security system, so totalisation does not apply in the usual sense; expat funded-pension treatment is case-specific. Escalate to a qualified Georgian adviser."

**R-GE-SC-5 -- Specific penalty quantification.** *Trigger:* request for exact GEL fines for non-filing/non-payment. *Message:* "The 0.05%/day late interest is confirmed, but exact GEL declaration fines are not reliably sourced here [RESEARCH GAP]. Do not state a precise fine; direct the client to rs.ge / the current Tax Code of Georgia."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Georgian payroll, PIT, and pension. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference. PIT and pension transfers EXCLUDE from any VAT return — they are statutory payroll/withholding obligations, not business supplies.

### 3.1 Funded pension transfers (employee 2% + employer 2%)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION AGENCY, საპენსიო სააგენტო | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | Transfer to LEPL Pension Fund |
| PENSION FUND, LEPL PENSION FUND | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | Same |
| საპენსიო, SAPENSIO, PENSIO | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | Georgian-language reference |
| FUNDED PENSION, დაგროვებითი პენსია | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | "Funded/accumulated pension" |
| PENSION 2%, PENSION CONTRIB | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | Explicit rate/contribution reference |

### 3.2 Pension transfers appearing on specific Georgian banks

| Bank | Typical debit description | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| TBC Bank | "PENSION AGENCY" or "საპენსიო სააგენტო" | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution |
| Bank of Georgia (BOG) | "PENSION FUND" or "PENSIO" | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution |
| Liberty Bank | "PENSION AGENCY GE" or "PENSIO" | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution |
| Wise / Revolut | Rare — pension transfers usually from local GEL accounts | If present, EXCLUDE |

### 3.3 PIT / Revenue Service payments (NOT pension -- do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| REVENUE SERVICE, RS.GE, შემოსავლების სამსახური | EXCLUDE -- PIT/tax payment | 20% PIT withholding remittance, not pension |
| INCOME TAX, PIT, საშემოსავლო | EXCLUDE -- income tax | Withheld at source, not pension |
| DECLARATION, დეკლარაცია | EXCLUDE -- tax declaration payment | Unified monthly declaration |
| VAT, დღგ, DGG | EXCLUDE -- VAT, not pension | Separate from payroll |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from pension/PIT classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARY, ხელფასი, KHELPASI (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net-of-PIT-and-pension wage payment |
| SALARY, ხელფასი (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Net salary received by employee |

### 3.5 Pension benefits received (NOT a contribution paid)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PENSION PAYOUT, საპენსიო გადახდა | EXCLUDE -- pension benefit received | Inbound credit, not a contribution |
| STATE PENSION, OLD AGE PENSION | EXCLUDE -- pension income | Not a contribution |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Bank-statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Tbilisi employer and its employees. All amounts in GEL. PIT is a flat 20% withheld at source; funded pension is 2% employee + 2% employer (matsne 4280127; PwC).

### Example 1 -- Low salary, mandatory participant (annual ≤ GEL 24,000)

**Input line:**
`15.02.2025 ; PENSION AGENCY ; DEBIT ; PENSION FEB 2025 EMP+EE ; -40.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** Monthly taxable salary GEL 1,000 (annual GEL 12,000 ≤ 24,000). Employee aged 32 — mandatory participant.

**Reasoning:**
Employee pension 2% × 1,000 = GEL 20. Employer pension 2% × 1,000 = GEL 20. Combined transfer to the Pension Agency = GEL 40 (matches the line). PIT 20% × 1,000 = GEL 200, remitted separately to rs.ge. State co-contribution 2% × 1,000 = GEL 20/month credited by the government (not a bank movement). Net pay to employee = 1,000 − 200 (PIT) − 20 (employee pension) = **GEL 780**.

Check: 200 + 20 + 780 = 1,000. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — funded pension contribution (employer 2% + employee 2%).

### Example 2 -- Mid salary, middle state tier (annual GEL 24,000–60,000)

**Input line:**
`15.04.2025 ; REVENUE SERVICE ; DEBIT ; MONTHLY DECLARATION MAR 2025 ; -600.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** Monthly taxable salary GEL 3,000 (annual GEL 36,000 — middle state tier). Employee aged 41, mandatory participant (no opt-out elected).

**Reasoning:**
The line is the PIT remittance: 20% × 3,000 = GEL 600 (matches). Employee pension 2% × 3,000 = GEL 60; employer pension 2% × 3,000 = GEL 60 (a separate Pension Agency transfer of GEL 120). State co-contribution on annual GEL 36,000 = 2% × 24,000 + 1% × 12,000 = 480 + 120 = **GEL 600/year** (≈ GEL 50/month). Net pay = 3,000 − 600 − 60 = **GEL 2,340**.

Check: 600 + 60 + 2,340 = 3,000. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — PIT withholding remittance (NOT a pension transfer).

### Example 3 -- High salary, state share capped (annual > GEL 60,000)

**Input line:**
`15.06.2025 ; PENSION FUND ; DEBIT ; PENSION MAY 2025 ; -240.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** Monthly taxable salary GEL 6,000 (annual GEL 72,000 > 60,000). Employee aged 29, mandatory participant.

**Reasoning:**
Employee pension 2% × 6,000 = GEL 120; employer pension 2% × 6,000 = GEL 120; combined transfer = GEL 240 (matches). The 2%+2% applies to the FULL salary — there is no ceiling on the employee/employer portion. State co-contribution: 2% × 24,000 + 1% × 36,000 + 0% above 60,000 = 480 + 360 = **GEL 840/year**; nothing on the income above GEL 60,000. PIT 20% × 6,000 = GEL 1,200. Net pay = 6,000 − 1,200 − 120 = **GEL 4,680**.

Check: 1,200 + 120 + 4,680 = 6,000. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — funded pension contribution (employer 2% + employee 2%).

### Example 4 -- Self-employed voluntary opt-in (4%)

**Input line:**
`20.03.2025 ; საპენსიო სააგენტო ; DEBIT ; VOLUNTARY PENSION 2024 ; -2,000.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** Self-employed individual entrepreneur, annual income GEL 50,000, has **elected** to participate in the funded pension.

**Reasoning:**
Self-employed participation is VOLUNTARY (default off). Since this individual opted in, the rate is 4% of income: 4% × 50,000 = **GEL 2,000** (matches). State co-contribution follows the same tiers: 2% × 24,000 + 1% × 26,000 = 480 + 260 = **GEL 740/year**. If the individual had NOT opted in, no pension contribution would be due (matsne 4280127).

Check: 4% × 50,000 = 2,000. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT — voluntary self-employed funded pension contribution.

### Example 5 -- Revenue Service payment that is NOT pension

**Input line:**
`14.05.2025 ; შემოსავლების სამსახური ; DEBIT ; VAT APR 2025 ; -1,800.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** The reference says "VAT" (დღგ), not pension or PIT.

**Reasoning:**
Matches the Revenue Service pattern (3.3) but the reference is **VAT**, not pension or PIT withholding. This is a VAT remittance (standard rate 18%, registration threshold GEL 100,000 turnover — GSL/PwC), entirely separate from the funded pension. Do NOT classify as a social/pension contribution.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from social-contribution classification — VAT payment (handle under a VAT skill).

### Example 6 -- Ambiguous pension debit (arrears / penalty)

**Input line:**
`15.09.2025 ; PENSION AGENCY ; DEBIT ; ARREARS + INTEREST ; -510.00 ; GEL`

**Facts:** Irregular amount; reference mentions "ARREARS + INTEREST."

**Reasoning:**
Matches the Pension Agency pattern (3.1) but the amount is irregular and references interest. Late amounts accrue 0.05%/day under the Tax Code of Georgia, so this likely bundles overdue contribution principal with interest. The split cannot be derived without a Pension Agency / Revenue Service statement. Flag for reviewer.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag for reviewer — request a statement to split contribution principal from late interest. Specific GEL fines are **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when the data is clear and the engagement is confirmed to be **Georgia the country**.

### Rule 1 -- There is NO classic social security

Georgia has no payroll-tax-funded health, unemployment, or social-security fund. The ONLY mandatory employment social-insurance levy is the funded pension. Do not model any other social contribution (PwC, Individual — Other taxes).

### Rule 2 -- Funded pension formula

```
employee_pension = 2% × taxable_gross_salary
employer_pension = 2% × taxable_gross_salary
state_cocontribution = 2% × min(annual_income, 24,000)
                     + 1% × clamp(annual_income − 24,000, 0, 36,000)
                     + 0% × max(annual_income − 60,000, 0)
```

The 2% employee and 2% employer apply to the FULL taxable salary (no ceiling). Only the state share is tiered/capped at GEL 60,000 (matsne 4280127).

### Rule 3 -- PIT is a flat 20%, withheld at source

Employers withhold 20% PIT on gross salary (PAYE-style) and remit it with the unified monthly income-tax declaration. There are no progressive brackets (PwC, Individual — Taxes on personal income).

### Rule 4 -- Net pay computation

```
net_pay = gross_salary − PIT(20%) − employee_pension(2%)
```

Employer pension (2%) is an employer on-cost paid in addition to gross salary, not deducted from the employee. The state co-contribution is credited by the government and is not a bank movement (matsne 4280127).

### Rule 5 -- Pension base equals the PIT base

Funded pension is computed on **taxable salary** — the same base as PIT (matsne 4280127).

### Rule 6 -- Participation is mandatory for working-age employees

Mandatory for all employees who were under age 60 (women under 55) at the law's entry into force (1 Jan 2019); participation begins automatically on the first employer contribution (matsne 4280127; PwC).

### Rule 7 -- Voluntary groups

Persons aged 60/55+ at enactment, and self-employed individuals, participate **voluntarily**. Self-employed opt-in rate is 4% of income (matsne 4280127).

### Rule 8 -- Opt-out window (age 40+)

Employees aged 40 or older before the effective date may withdraw, but only within the window **after 3 months and before 5 months** from joining (matsne 4280127).

### Rule 9 -- Monthly compliance

PIT and the unified monthly income-tax declaration are due by the **15th** of the month following the salary-payment month; pension contributions must be transferred no later than the same **15th** (PwC, Corporate — Tax administration; F-Chain 2025).

### Rule 10 -- Single declaration since 1 May 2025

From 1 May 2025, employers no longer file a separate pension declaration — pension data is auto-populated in the Pension Agency system from the income-tax declaration filed with the Revenue Service, and the pension declaration auto-closes once the transferred amount matches (F-Chain, 1 May 2025).

### Rule 11 -- Calendar tax year; annual return 1 April

The tax year is the calendar year. Annual individual income tax returns (for income not taxed at source) are due by 1 April of the following year (PwC, Individual — Tax administration).

### Rule 12 -- Late interest

Late payment of tax/contributions accrues interest at 0.05% of the unpaid amount per overdue day (Tax Code of Georgia; PwC/GSL).

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

Flag these for reviewer judgement.

### T2-1 -- Employee near the 60/55 age boundary

**Trigger:** Worker's age at 1 Jan 2019 enactment is close to 60 (men) / 55 (women).
**Issue:** Above that age at enactment → participation is voluntary, not mandatory.
**Action:** Confirm enactment-date age with the Pension Agency before treating as mandatory. Flag for reviewer.

### T2-2 -- Age-40+ opt-out election

**Trigger:** Worker was 40+ before the effective date and may have used the 3–5 month opt-out window.
**Issue:** A valid withdrawal means no further employee/employer pension is due for that worker.
**Action:** Verify the opt-out status; do not withhold pension if a valid opt-out exists. Flag for reviewer.

### T2-3 -- State co-contribution tier application (monthly vs annual)

**Trigger:** Income straddles the GEL 24,000 / 60,000 annual thresholds.
**Issue:** Whether the tiers are prorated monthly or reconciled annually is **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against rs.ge guidance]**.
**Action:** Compute the employer/employee 2%+2% normally; flag the state-share tiering for reviewer reconciliation.

### T2-4 -- Self-employed participation election

**Trigger:** Self-employed individual asks whether to/has opted into the pension.
**Issue:** Participation is voluntary at 4%; default is OFF until election.
**Action:** Confirm whether an election was made before applying 4%. Flag for reviewer.

### T2-5 -- Pension/PIT arrears

**Trigger:** Unpaid pension or PIT from prior periods.
**Issue:** 0.05%/day interest accrues; exact GEL declaration fines are **[RESEARCH GAP]**.
**Action:** Do not quantify without a Revenue Service / Pension Agency statement. Escalate to a qualified Georgian adviser.

### T2-6 -- Expat / non-resident worker

**Trigger:** Foreign worker on a Georgian payroll.
**Issue:** Funded-pension applicability and source-of-income rules are case-specific; Georgia has no totalisation framework in the usual sense.
**Action:** Flag for reviewer / qualified Georgian adviser.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How pension and PIT movements appear on Georgian bank statements

**TBC Bank:**
- Description: "PENSION AGENCY" / "საპენსიო სააგენტო" (pension) or "REVENUE SERVICE" / "შემოსავლების სამსახური" (PIT)
- Timing: around the 15th of the month following the salary-payment month
- Amount: pension transfer = 4% of salary (employer 2% + employee 2%); PIT = 20% of gross

**Bank of Georgia (BOG):**
- Description: "PENSION FUND" / "PENSIO" (pension) or "INCOME TAX" / "საშემოსავლო" (PIT)
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Liberty Bank:**
- Description: "PENSION AGENCY GE" or "REVENUE SERVICE GE"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Key identification tips:**
1. Pension and PIT transfers are always outgoing (DEBIT) for the employer.
2. A combined pension transfer ≈ 4% of gross salary (2% employer + 2% employee). PIT ≈ 20% of gross.
3. The state co-contribution is NOT a bank movement — it is credited by the government to the individual account.
4. Do NOT confuse Revenue Service (rs.ge) PIT/VAT debits with Pension Agency (pensions.ge) pension transfers.
5. Georgian-language refs: საპენსიო = pension; საშემოსავლო = income tax; დღგ = VAT; ხელფასი = salary.
6. Irregular Pension Agency debits referencing "arrears" or "interest" may bundle 0.05%/day late interest — flag for reviewer.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Confirm jurisdiction** — verify the currency is GEL and references are to rs.ge / Pension Agency, not the IRS / U.S. Georgia. If USD/IRS, STOP (R-GE-SC-1).
2. **Scan for Pension Agency debits** — identify outgoing payments matching Section 3.1/3.2. A combined transfer ÷ 0.04 estimates gross salary (2% + 2% = 4%).
3. **Scan for Revenue Service debits** — PIT remittances ≈ 20% of gross salary; reconcile against pension-derived salary estimate.
4. **Reverse-engineer participation** — if pension debits exist, the worker is participating (mandatory or voluntary). If none, the worker may be opted-out, voluntary-off, or pre-1 May 2019 exempt — flag.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Pension/PIT classification derived from bank-statement amounts only. Worker age, participation status, and the state co-contribution tiers have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing the monthly declaration."

### Forms / declarations

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unified monthly income-tax declaration (rs.ge) | Reports salaries paid, PIT withheld; auto-derives pension data from 1 May 2025 | 15th of the month following the salary-payment month | PwC; F-Chain 2025 |
| Pension contribution transfer (Pension Agency) | Transfer of employer 2% + employee 2% to individual accounts | No later than the 15th of the month following the salary-payment month | F-Chain 2025 |
| Annual individual income tax return | Declare income not taxed at source (self-employed, capital gains, etc.) | 1 April of the year following the tax year | PwC Individual — Tax administration |

### Penalties

| Penalty | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late payment of tax/contributions | Interest at 0.05% of the unpaid amount per overdue day | Tax Code of Georgia; PwC/GSL |
| Failure to submit a required document | Statutory fine (PwC notes ~GEL 4 per document failure); exact declaration fines **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the current Tax Code of Georgia]** | PwC/GSL |

### Minimum wage

There is no effective statutory national minimum wage. The nominal figure (Presidential Decree No. 351 of 1999) is ~GEL 20/month private sector and ~GEL 115/month public sector — unchanged since 1999 and economically irrelevant; market and living wages are far higher. **[RESEARCH GAP — sourced from secondary HR/payroll sites (CXC Global, Playroll), not an official gazette; treat as "Georgia effectively has no functional minimum wage."]**

### Calculation examples (2025)

| Monthly gross | Annual | State tier | Employee pension (2%) | Employer pension (2%) | PIT (20%) | Net pay |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GEL 1,000 | GEL 12,000 | 2% (≤24k) | GEL 20 | GEL 20 | GEL 200 | GEL 780 |
| GEL 3,000 | GEL 36,000 | 1% band | GEL 60 | GEL 60 | GEL 600 | GEL 2,340 |
| GEL 6,000 | GEL 72,000 | 0% above 60k | GEL 120 | GEL 120 | GEL 1,200 | GEL 4,680 |

Arithmetic check: 1,000 − 200 − 20 = 780; 3,000 − 600 − 60 = 2,340; 6,000 − 1,200 − 120 = 4,680. ✓ Source: matsne 4280127; PwC.

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Country of Georgia, monthly gross GEL 1,000, employee aged 32 (mandatory). → Employee pension GEL 20, employer pension GEL 20, PIT GEL 200, net pay GEL 780. (1,000 − 200 − 20 = 780.)

**Test 2:** Monthly gross GEL 3,000 (annual GEL 36,000), aged 41, no opt-out. → Employee pension GEL 60, employer pension GEL 60, PIT GEL 600, net pay GEL 2,340. State share GEL 600/yr (480 + 120). (3,000 − 600 − 60 = 2,340.)

**Test 3:** Monthly gross GEL 6,000 (annual GEL 72,000), aged 29. → Employee pension GEL 120, employer pension GEL 120, PIT GEL 1,200, net pay GEL 4,680. State share GEL 840/yr (480 + 360, nothing above 60k). (6,000 − 1,200 − 120 = 4,680.)

**Test 4:** Self-employed, annual GEL 50,000, opted IN. → Pension 4% = GEL 2,000. State share GEL 740/yr (480 + 260). (4% × 50,000 = 2,000.)

**Test 5:** Self-employed, annual GEL 50,000, did NOT opt in. → No pension contribution due (voluntary, default off).

**Test 6:** Worker aged 62 at 1 Jan 2019 enactment. → Voluntary participant only; mandatory 2%+2% does NOT apply unless they elect in. Flag for reviewer (T2-1).

**Test 7:** Client mentions USD, the IRS, and Atlanta. → STOP. Wrong jurisdiction (U.S. state of Georgia). Refuse per R-GE-SC-1.

**Test 8:** Revenue Service debit referencing "VAT APR 2025." → Classify as VAT (18%), NOT a social/pension contribution.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply this skill to the U.S. state of Georgia — confirm the country (GEL, rs.ge, Pension Agency) first.
- NEVER model a health/unemployment/"social security" payroll contribution for Georgia — none exists.
- NEVER assume a state co-contribution above GEL 60,000 annual income — the state share is zero there.
- NEVER apply a ceiling to the employee/employer 2%+2% — only the state share is capped.
- NEVER treat self-employed participation as mandatory — it is voluntary (4%) only on election.
- NEVER quantify pension/PIT arrears or exact GEL fines without a Revenue Service / Pension Agency statement — flag as [RESEARCH GAP] and escalate.
- NEVER use progressive PIT brackets — Georgia's PIT is a flat 20%.
- NEVER present figures as definitive — label as estimated, pending reviewer sign-off, and direct the client to rs.ge / the Pension Agency.
