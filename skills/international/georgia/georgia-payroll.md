  Use this skill whenever asked about Georgia (the country / Republic of Georgia — Sakartvelo, Caucasus) payroll processing for employed persons. Trigger on phrases like "Georgia payroll", "Georgian payroll", "khelfasi", "salary tax Georgia", "PIT withholding Georgia", "20% income tax Georgia", "PAYE Georgia", "funded pension Georgia", "pension contribution Georgia", "Pension Agency", "pensions.ge", "Revenue Service Georgia", "rs.ge payroll", "monthly withholding declaration Georgia", "net salary Georgia", "gross to net Georgia", "employer cost Georgia", "minimum wage Georgia", or any question about computing employee pay, salary withholding tax, or mandatory funded pension contributions for Georgia-based employees. This skill covers the flat 20% personal income tax withheld at source (PAYE), the mandatory funded pension (employer 2% + employee 2% + state co-contribution), participation rules, the monthly withholding declaration on rs.ge, and penalties. CRITICAL: jurisdiction code GE here is the COUNTRY of Georgia (currency GEL, lari) — NOT the US state of Georgia (USD). ALWAYS read this skill before processing any Georgia (country) payroll.

# Georgia Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — Research-verified.** Rates and structure are cross-verified across PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Georgia, Individual & Corporate), the Law of Georgia "On Funded Pension" (matsne.gov.ge), the Tax Code of Georgia, Mondaq/Eurofast and Georgian practitioner sources (TPsolution, CXC Global). Official Georgian-language statute PDFs were not directly text-extracted line-by-line; figures rely on the English consolidations on matsne.gov.ge plus Big-4 and specialist summaries. Every figure below carries an inline source or a `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` marker. A qualified Georgian tax adviser / authorised accountant must validate this skill before production use.

> **CRITICAL DISAMBIGUATION.** Jurisdiction code **GE = the country / Republic of Georgia (Sakartvelo, Caucasus), currency GEL (Georgian lari)**. This skill has **nothing to do with the US state of Georgia** (USD, Form G-7, ~5.19% flat state rate). If a request concerns the US state, this is the WRONG skill — escalate.

## Confidence Tier Definitions

Every rule in this skill is tagged with a confidence tier:

- **[T1] Tier 1 -- Deterministic.** Apply exactly as written. No reviewer judgement required.
- **[T2] Tier 2 -- Reviewer Judgement Required.** Flag the issue and present options. A qualified Georgian tax adviser must confirm before filing.
- **[T3] Tier 3 -- Out of Scope / Escalate.** Skill does not cover this. Do not guess. Escalate and document the gap.

---

## Section 2 -- Personal Income Tax (PIT) Withholding -- PAYE

Employment income is taxed at a **flat 20%** of gross salary. The employer withholds PIT **at source** at the moment of salary payment and remits it to the Revenue Service. There is **no tax-free personal allowance** and **no progressive bracket** for employment income — the rate is a single flat 20%. Source: PwC WWTS Georgia, Corporate: Other taxes; Tax Code of Georgia.

### PIT formula [T1]

```
PIT = Gross salary × 20%
```

- There is no tax-free band, no standard deduction, and no marital/dependant adjustment for salary. [T1]
- PIT is computed on **actual gross salary**; it is **not** subject to any pension floor/ceiling. [T1]
- PIT payment is due on the **day wages are paid**; the monthly withholding declaration is filed by the **15th of the following month** via rs.ge. Source: PwC WWTS Georgia, Tax administration; Tax Code.

### Other PIT rates (context — NOT employment income) [T1 / informational]

| Income type | Rate | Note | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Residential rental (individual, no deductions claimed) | 5% flat on gross | Optional; otherwise 20% on net. Not employment income. | PwC WWTS Georgia, Individual: Income determination |
| Small-business status individual entrepreneur | 1% of turnover (3% if turnover > GEL 500,000/yr) | Self-employed / IE regime, not employees. | PwC WWTS Georgia, Individual |
| Micro-business status individual | 0% (exempt) | Annual turnover < GEL 30,000, no employees. Not employment income. | PwC WWTS Georgia, Individual |

> These special regimes apply to **self-employed individuals**, not to employees. Do not apply them to a payroll computation. If a "salary" turns out to be IE turnover, this is [T3] — out of scope for payroll.

## Section 3 -- Funded Pension Contributions

A **mandatory funded pension** has been in force since **1 January 2019**. For each participating employee it is funded by three sources: the **employer (2%)**, the **employee (2%, withheld by the employer)**, and the **State** (a co-contribution on a sliding scale). Source: Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6); PwC WWTS Georgia, Individual: Other taxes.

### Funded pension rate table [T1]

| Source | Rate | Base | Who pays / how | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Employer | 2% | Employee gross salary | Employer, on top of gross | Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6); PwC |
| Employee | 2% | Employee gross salary | Withheld from gross by employer | Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6) |
| State co-contribution | 2% / 1% / 0% (see schedule) | Participant's **annual** income | Government of Georgia | Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6) |
| **Combined employer + employee (private)** | **4%** | Gross salary | 2% employer + 2% employee | derived from Art. 3(6) |

**Arithmetic check:** private contributions = employer 2% + employee 2% = **4%** of gross. The State portion is paid by the Government and is **not** an employer or employee cost. [T1]

### State co-contribution schedule [T1]

The State co-contribution is based on the participant's **annual** salary/income and is tiered. Thresholds reset each calendar year. Source: Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6).

| Annual income band (GEL) | State co-contribution rate |
|---|---|
| Up to 24,000 | 2% |
| Portion from 24,000 to 60,000 | 1% |
| Above 60,000 | 0% (no State contribution) |

**Arithmetic check (state co-contribution worked):** [T1]
- Annual income GEL 20,000 (< 24,000): 20,000 × 2% = **GEL 400/yr**.
- Annual income GEL 36,000: (24,000 × 2%) + (12,000 × 1%) = 480 + 120 = **GEL 600/yr**.
- Annual income GEL 70,000: (24,000 × 2%) + (36,000 × 1%) + (10,000 × 0%) = 480 + 360 + 0 = **GEL 840/yr** (the GEL 60,000+ portion gets 0%).

### Contribution base for the private 2% + 2% [T2]

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].** Authoritative sources confirm the GEL 24,000 / GEL 60,000 threshold schedule **only for the STATE co-contribution**. Whether the **employee/employer 2% base is itself capped** (e.g. at GEL 60,000) for very high earners, or computed on **full gross salary**, is not pinned to a primary source. **Conservative default (CD2):** compute the 2% + 2% on **full gross salary** unless verified otherwise. Verify cap treatment with the Pension Agency (pensions.ge) or the Law's implementing regulations before finalising payroll for high earners.

### Participation rules [T1]

- Participation is **mandatory** for employees. Source: Law on Funded Pension.
- **Voluntary opt-out** is available only for those who had reached **60 (men) / 55 (women) before the law's entry into force (1 Jan 2019)**. For such persons participation is voluntary. Source: Law on Funded Pension; CD3.
- **Self-employed** individuals contribute **4% of annual income** (no employer component, since there is no employer). Source: PwC WWTS Georgia, Individual: Other taxes; Law on Funded Pension. (Self-employed is not payroll — see Section 6 refusal catalogue.)

---

## Section 4 -- Gross-to-Net Computation Order

The deterministic order of operations for a standard monthly payroll of a **participating employee** (under 60/55 at 1 Jan 2019, so enrolled): [T1]

```
1.  Determine gross salary (khelfasi), in GEL.
2.  PIT = gross × 20%                              (withheld from gross).
3.  Employee funded pension = gross × 2%           (withheld from gross).
4.  Net pay = gross − PIT − employee pension
            = gross × (1 − 0.20 − 0.02)
            = gross × 0.78.
5.  Employer funded pension = gross × 2%           (paid on top of gross).
6.  Total employer cash cost = gross + employer pension
            = gross × 1.02.
7.  State co-contribution is added to the employee's pension account by the Government
    (per the Section 3 schedule); it is NOT an employer or employee cash cost.
```

Source: PwC WWTS Georgia (PIT 20% withholding); Law on Funded Pension Art. 3(6) (2% + 2%).

**Arithmetic check:** net multiplier = 1 − 0.20 − 0.02 = **0.78**; employer cost multiplier = 1 + 0.02 = **1.02**. [T1]

> For an employee who is **exempt** from the funded pension (60+/55+ before 1 Jan 2019 and has not opted in), drop the 2% lines: net = gross × 0.80; employer cost = gross (no employer pension). [T1]

---

## Section 5 -- Conservative Defaults

When a fact is unknown, apply these defaults and flag for the reviewer. Source: research `conservative_defaults`.

| # | Default assumption | Rationale / source |
|---|---|---|
| CD1 | Employer total statutory on-cost = **2% of gross** (the funded-pension employer share) — there is no other employer payroll/social tax in Georgia. | Georgia has no general employer social-security tax. PwC WWTS Georgia, Corporate. |
| CD2 | Compute the employee/employer 2% + 2% on **full gross salary**; do **not** assume a GEL 60,000 cap on the private share — the GEL 24,000/60,000 thresholds are confirmed only for the STATE co-contribution. Flag [T2]. | Threshold schedule confirmed for State portion only; private cap unverified. `[RESEARCH GAP]` |
| CD3 | Assume **mandatory enrolment** for the employee, except those aged 60+ (men) / 55+ (women) **before 1 Jan 2019**, for whom participation is voluntary. | Law on Funded Pension (mandatory participation). |
| CD4 | Treat the statutory **GEL 20/month** private-sector minimum wage as **non-binding**; use the agreed contractual salary as the payroll base. | The 1999 statutory minimum is obsolete and not enforced. CXC Global; wage.is. |
| CD5 | Treat the income as standard **employment income** (PAYE) unless told otherwise; do not apply small-business/micro-business/IE regimes to payroll. | Those regimes apply to self-employed individuals, not employees. PwC WWTS Georgia. |

---

## Section 6 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing any payroll [T1]

Ask for any unknown item. Do **not** compute until items 1--4 are confirmed.

1. **Employer TIN** (9- or 11-digit tax identification number) and registration with the Revenue Service.
2. **Pay period and payment date** (PIT is due on the payment date; the withholding declaration is filed by the 15th of the following month).
3. **Gross salary for the period**, in GEL. If only a net figure is known, flag for gross-up (iterative) and present as estimate only [T2].
4. **Funded-pension status** of the employee: enrolled (mandatory) or exempt/opted-out under the 60/55 pre-2019 rule (CD3) [T2 if unclear].

### Refusal Catalogue [T1]

Refuse to produce a final payroll figure and escalate when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Request concerns the **US state of Georgia** (USD, Form G-7, state withholding) | STOP. Wrong jurisdiction. This skill is the COUNTRY of Georgia (GEL). Escalate to the correct US-state skill [T3]. |
| Gross salary not provided (only "net" or "budget") | Gross-up required (gross = net / 0.78 for an enrolled employee; / 0.80 if pension-exempt). Present as estimate only and flag [T2]. |
| Payment date / pay period unknown | STOP. Declaration timing depends on the payment date. |
| Worker is a **self-employed individual / individual entrepreneur** (small-business 1%/3%, micro-business 0%, or 4% self-employed pension) | OUT OF SCOPE for payroll. Escalate to the relevant Georgia skill / adviser [T3]. |
| Income is **not employment income** (dividends, interest, rent, services) | OUT OF SCOPE for this skill. The 5% rental rate, withholding on dividends/interest etc. are separate [T3]. |
| Funded-pension cap treatment for a **high earner** materially affects the result | Apply CD2 (full gross), flag [T2] / `[RESEARCH GAP]`, and require Pension Agency confirmation. |

## Section 7 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (Deterministic)

Map bank-statement narrations (often Georgian / transliterated) to payroll classifications. All patterns [T1] unless flagged. Georgian banks: TBC Bank, Bank of Georgia, Liberty Bank, Basis Bank, Credo Bank, ProCredit Georgia.

### 7a. Salary credits to the employee's account

| Narration pattern (Georgian / common) | Classification |
|---|---|
| KHELFASI, ხელფასი | Net salary payment |
| KHELFASI [month/year], MONTHLY SALARY | Net monthly salary |
| ANAZGHAUREBA, AREMUNERATSIA, REMUNERATION | Salary / remuneration |
| AVANSI, SALARY ADVANCE | Salary advance — partial net payment [T2] |
| PREMIA, BONUS | Bonus — taxable as employment income (20% PIT + 2% pension apply) [T1] |

### 7b. Employer remittances (debits from the company account)

| Narration pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| REVENUE SERVICE, RS.GE, SASIMOSAVLO SAMSAKHURI | PIT withholding remittance to the Revenue Service |
| GADASAKHADI, TAX PAYMENT | Tax payment (PIT) |
| SAPENSIO, PENSION AGENCY, PENSIONS.GE | Funded pension transfer (employer 2% + withheld employee 2%) |
| DAGROVEBITI SAPENSIO | Funded ("accumulated") pension contribution |
| KHELFASEBI, PAYROLL, NET WAGES | Net salary disbursement to employees |

> Salaries, PIT and pension contributions are **never** items on a VAT (VAT/DAANG) return — keep them out of georgia-vat. Source: georgia-vat.md Section 3.8 (KHELFASI / salary = EXCLUDE).

## Section 8 -- Filing Obligations

### Forms [T1]

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Portal | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Monthly withholding (PIT) declaration** | Employer reports PIT withheld on salaries (and other withholding — dividends, interest, services) | By the **15th** of the month following the payment month; **PIT payment due on the day wages are paid** | rs.ge / eservices.rs.ge | PwC WWTS Georgia, Tax administration; TPsolution; expathub.ge |
| **Funded pension contribution** | Employer transfers employer 2% + withheld employee 2% to the Pension Agency | Monthly, alongside payroll (Pension Agency / Revenue Service systems) | Pension Agency systems | Law on Funded Pension; PwC |
| **Annual individual income tax declaration** | Resident individuals whose income was **not** taxed at source must file | Before **1 April** for the prior calendar year | rs.ge | PwC WWTS Georgia, Tax administration |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact monthly mechanics/timing for remitting funded-pension contributions to the Pension Agency versus filing the PIT declaration on rs.ge. The two are processed through parallel systems; confirm operational sequencing. Source: research caveat (3).

> For an employee whose salary is fully taxed at source (PAYE), **no annual return** is generally required — the annual return is for individuals with income **not** taxed at source. [T1]

---

## Section 9 -- Minimum Wage

Georgia's statutory minimum wage is **functionally obsolete**. Source: CXC Global; wage.is.

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Private-sector statutory minimum | GEL 20/month (Presidential Decree No. 351 of 1999, unchanged) | CXC Global; wage.is |
| Public-sector minimum | ~GEL 115/month | CXC Global |
| Practical position | The 1999 statutory minimum is **non-binding** in practice; the de facto market floor is far higher. Payroll is based on the **contractual salary**. | CXC Global; CD4 |

> **Do not** treat GEL 20/month as a meaningful wage floor (CD4). Use the agreed contractual salary as the payroll base.

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All figures in GEL. Each example is recomputed end-to-end. Unless stated, the employee is **enrolled** in the funded pension (net = gross × 0.78; employer cost = gross × 1.02).

### Example 1 -- Standard salary, GEL 2,000 gross, enrolled [T1]

- PIT = 2,000 × 20% = **400.00**
- Employee funded pension = 2,000 × 2% = **40.00**
- **Net pay = 2,000 − 400.00 − 40.00 = 1,560.00** (= 2,000 × 0.78) ✓
- Employer funded pension = 2,000 × 2% = **40.00**
- **Total employer cost = 2,000 + 40.00 = 2,040.00** (= 2,000 × 1.02) ✓

Bank statement: a credit of GEL 1,560.00 narrated `KHELFASI 03/2025`.

### Example 2 -- Mid salary, GEL 3,500 gross, enrolled [T1]

- PIT = 3,500 × 20% = **700.00**
- Employee funded pension = 3,500 × 2% = **70.00**
- **Net pay = 3,500 − 700.00 − 70.00 = 2,730.00** (= 3,500 × 0.78) ✓
- Employer funded pension = 3,500 × 2% = **70.00**
- **Total employer cost = 3,570.00** (= 3,500 × 1.02) ✓

### Example 3 -- Low salary, GEL 1,000 gross, enrolled [T1]

- PIT = 1,000 × 20% = **200.00**
- Employee funded pension = 1,000 × 2% = **20.00**
- **Net pay = 1,000 − 200.00 − 20.00 = 780.00** (= 1,000 × 0.78) ✓
- Employer funded pension = 1,000 × 2% = **20.00**
- **Total employer cost = 1,020.00** ✓

> Note: there is **no tax-free allowance** — PIT applies from the first lari of salary. [T1]

### Example 4 -- High salary, GEL 8,000 gross/month, enrolled [T1] / [T2]

- PIT = 8,000 × 20% = **1,600.00**
- Employee funded pension (CD2: full gross) = 8,000 × 2% = **160.00**
- **Net pay = 8,000 − 1,600.00 − 160.00 = 6,240.00** (= 8,000 × 0.78) ✓
- Employer funded pension = 8,000 × 2% = **160.00**
- **Total employer cost = 8,160.00** (= 8,000 × 1.02) ✓

> **[T2] / [RESEARCH GAP].** Annualised, GEL 8,000/month = GEL 96,000/yr, which is above GEL 60,000. The **State** co-contribution would be **0%** on the portion above GEL 60,000. Whether the **private 2% + 2%** is itself capped at GEL 60,000 of annual salary is unconfirmed — CD2 computes on full gross; confirm with the Pension Agency. Source: research caveat (1).

### Example 5 -- Pension-exempt employee (60+/55+ before 1 Jan 2019), GEL 2,500 gross [T1]

- Employee is **exempt** from the funded pension and has not opted in (CD3). Drop both 2% lines.
- PIT = 2,500 × 20% = **500.00**
- Employee funded pension = **0.00**
- **Net pay = 2,500 − 500.00 = 2,000.00** (= 2,500 × 0.80) ✓
- Employer funded pension = **0.00**
- **Total employer cost = 2,500.00** (no employer pension) ✓

### Example 6 -- State co-contribution illustration (not a cash cost), annual GEL 36,000 [T1]

For an enrolled employee earning GEL 3,000/month (= GEL 36,000/yr):

- Employee contributes 36,000 × 2% = GEL 720/yr; employer contributes 36,000 × 2% = GEL 720/yr (CD2, full gross).
- **State** co-contribution = (24,000 × 2%) + (12,000 × 1%) = 480 + 120 = **GEL 600/yr** (paid by the Government to the employee's pension account).
- Total annual additions to the pension account ≈ 720 + 720 + 600 = **GEL 2,040** — but only the GEL 720 employer share is an **employer cash cost**, and only the GEL 720 employee share is **withheld from net pay**. The State GEL 600 is neither. [T1]

| B10 | Total to remit (PIT + employee pension + employer pension) | `=B5+B6+B8` |
| B11 | Memo: State co-contribution (annual, informational) | per Section 3 schedule on annualised salary — NOT a cash cost |

Validation rows: confirm B7 = B3 × 0.78 when B4 = 1 (B3 × 0.80 when B4 = 0); confirm B7 + B5 + B6 = B3; confirm B9 = B3 × 1.02 when B4 = 1.

## Section 15 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement is mid-year or records are incomplete:

1. **No prior withholding declarations on hand** → request the rs.ge declaration history; reconcile each month's PIT against bank remittances to the Revenue Service. Do not assume prior months were correct.
2. **Net-only history** → reconstruct gross via the gross-to-net order (Section 4): gross = net / 0.78 (enrolled) or net / 0.80 (pension-exempt), iterating for rounding; mark all reconstructed grosses as estimates [T2].
3. **Pension-enrolment status unknown** → default to **enrolled** (CD3) unless the employee was 60+/55+ before 1 Jan 2019; confirm before dropping the 2% lines.
4. **Worker type unclear (employee vs IE/self-employed)** → STOP and confirm; the IE/self-employed regimes are out of payroll scope [T3].
5. **High-earner pension cap uncertainty** → apply CD2 (full gross), flag [T2]/`[RESEARCH GAP]`, and ask the adviser to confirm with the Pension Agency.

## Section 17 -- Test Suite

Each test states inputs and the recomputed expected output. Reviewers should rerun every figure. All amounts in GEL. "Enrolled" means net = gross × 0.78, employer cost = gross × 1.02.

### Test 1 -- Standard salary, enrolled
**Input:** Gross GEL 2,000, paid March 2025, enrolled.
**Expected:** PIT 400.00. Employee pension 40.00. **Net 1,560.00.** Employer pension 40.00. **Total employer cost 2,040.00.** Total to remit 480.00.

### Test 2 -- Mid salary, enrolled
**Input:** Gross GEL 3,500, paid June 2025, enrolled.
**Expected:** PIT 700.00. Employee pension 70.00. **Net 2,730.00.** Employer pension 70.00. **Total employer cost 3,570.00.** Total to remit 840.00.

### Test 3 -- Low salary, enrolled
**Input:** Gross GEL 1,000, paid May 2025, enrolled.
**Expected:** PIT 200.00 (no tax-free allowance). Employee pension 20.00. **Net 780.00.** Employer pension 20.00. **Total employer cost 1,020.00.** Total to remit 240.00.

### Test 4 -- High salary, enrolled [T2]
**Input:** Gross GEL 8,000/month (GEL 96,000/yr), paid April 2025, enrolled, CD2 full-gross pension base.
**Expected:** PIT 1,600.00. Employee pension 160.00. **Net 6,240.00.** Employer pension 160.00. **Total employer cost 8,160.00.** Flag: private 2%+2% cap above GEL 60,000 unconfirmed `[RESEARCH GAP]`; State co-contribution 0% above GEL 60,000.

### Test 5 -- Pension-exempt employee (60+/55+ before 1 Jan 2019)
**Input:** Gross GEL 2,500, not enrolled (CD3 exemption).
**Expected:** PIT 500.00. Employee pension 0.00. **Net 2,000.00** (= 2,500 × 0.80). Employer pension 0.00. **Total employer cost 2,500.00.** Total to remit 500.00.

### Test 6 -- State co-contribution band check (annual)
**Input:** Annual salary GEL 36,000, enrolled.
**Expected:** State co-contribution = (24,000 × 2%) + (12,000 × 1%) = **GEL 600/yr** (Government-paid, not a cash cost). Employee/employer private share = 36,000 × 2% = GEL 720/yr each (CD2).

### Test 7 -- State co-contribution above GEL 60,000
**Input:** Annual salary GEL 70,000, enrolled.
**Expected:** State co-contribution = (24,000 × 2%) + (36,000 × 1%) + (10,000 × 0%) = 480 + 360 = **GEL 840/yr**; the portion above GEL 60,000 attracts 0% State contribution.

### Test 8 -- Wrong jurisdiction guard
**Input:** Request references "Georgia Form G-7" / USD state withholding.
**Expected:** REFUSE — this is the US state of Georgia, not the Republic of Georgia (GE/GEL). Escalate to the correct US-state skill [T3].

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER confuse the **country of Georgia (GE, GEL, lari)** with the **US state of Georgia (USD)** — the US state's rates and forms (e.g. Form G-7) must NOT appear in this skill.
- NEVER apply a tax-free personal allowance or progressive bands to Georgian salary PIT — it is a **flat 20%** from the first lari.
- NEVER add an employer social-security or payroll tax beyond the **2% funded pension** — there is no other employer on-cost in Georgia.
- NEVER drop the funded-pension 2% + 2% for an employee unless they qualify for the 60/55 pre-2019 opt-out (CD3) — participation is otherwise mandatory.
- NEVER assume the private employee/employer 2% is capped at GEL 60,000 — that schedule is confirmed only for the STATE co-contribution; apply CD2 (full gross) and flag `[RESEARCH GAP]`.
- NEVER treat the State co-contribution as an employer or employee cash cost — it is paid by the Government.
- NEVER apply the small-business (1%/3%), micro-business (0%) or 4% self-employed pension regimes to an employee's payroll — those are self-employed/IE regimes [T3].
- NEVER treat the obsolete GEL 20/month statutory minimum wage as a binding floor — use the contractual salary (CD4).
- NEVER miss the monthly withholding declaration (15th of the following month) or the on-payment-date PIT payment.
- NEVER guess any figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` — verify against matsne.gov.ge / the Pension Agency.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a qualified Georgian tax adviser / authorised accountant.
