## Notes

- The `steevenz/id-payroll-calculator` repo uses pre-HPP tax brackets (first bracket 0–50M, no 35% bracket). The skill file uses the current UU HPP brackets (first bracket 0–60M, includes 35% bracket above 5B).
- The JP wage ceiling in the repo code (IDR 7,000,000) is outdated. The skill file uses the 2025 ceiling of IDR 10,547,400.
- TER tables were sourced from PP 58/2023 Annex as published on official DJP and tax portal sites, not from the repos (which predate the TER scheme).
