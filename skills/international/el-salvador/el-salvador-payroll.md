### The single most important El Salvador payroll fact

> **The ISR retención table is applied to the salary AFTER deducting the employee's ISSS and AFP contributions** (those are *renta no gravada*). Base = gross − ISSS(employee) − AFP(employee). Applying the table to gross over-withholds. (Ministerio de Hacienda; SalarioSV; HazConta)

---

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Retención de ISR)

The employer withholds ISR monthly. **Base = gross salary − employee ISSS − employee AFP.** Apply the monthly table below to that base.

### Monthly retención table (Decreto Ejecutivo 10, in force 8 May 2025)

| Tramo | Monthly base (gross − AFP − ISSS), USD | Withholding |
|---|---|---|
| I | 0.01 -- 550.00 | Nil (exempt) |
| II | 550.01 -- 895.24 | USD 17.67 + 10% on excess over 550.00 |
| III | 895.25 -- 2,038.10 | USD 60.00 + 20% on excess over 895.24 |
| IV | 2,038.11 and over | USD 288.57 + 30% on excess over 2,038.10 |

*Source: Ministerio de Hacienda, Decreto Ejecutivo No. 10 (30 Apr 2025), in force 8 May 2025; the reform raised the monthly exempt amount from USD 472 (unchanged since 2011) to USD 550. (Diario El Mundo; Contaportable)*

> **Note.** The cuotas fijas (17.67 / 60.00 / 288.57) mirror the annual Art. 37 table ÷ 12 (annual 212.12 / 720.00 / 3,462.86). There is a small step at the $895.24 boundary (the 10% progression reaches 52.19 vs the $60.00 band-3 base). This is the official table, not an error.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security — ISSS (Health & Maternity)

ISSS covers health, maternity, and work-risk benefits. Contributions are computed on a salary base **capped at USD 1,000/month**.

| Contribution | Rate | Capped base | Maximum / month |
|---|---|---|---|
| ISSS — employee | 3% | USD 1,000 | USD 30.00 |
| ISSS — employer | 7.5% | USD 1,000 | USD 75.00 |

Salary above USD 1,000 does NOT increase the ISSS contribution — both sides are frozen at USD 30 / USD 75. (ISSS; PwC)

---

## Section 4 -- Pension — AFP (Sistema de Ahorro para Pensiones)

Pension contributions go to the employee's chosen AFP (Crecer or Confía). The contributory-base salary cap was **eliminated from January 2023** — AFP applies to the full salary with no maximum.

| Contribution | Rate | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| AFP — employee | 7.25% | None (cap removed Jan 2023) |
| AFP — employer | 8.75% | None |
| **Total AFP** | **16.00%** | None |

The 7.25% employee rate already includes the AFP commission and disability/survivor insurance premium. (SSF; Ley SAP; PwC)

---

## Section 5 -- Employer On-Costs (full picture)

| Employer contribution | Rate | Base / cap | On gross USD 1,000 |
|---|---|---|---|
| ISSS (employer) | 7.5% | capped at USD 1,000 | USD 75.00 |
| AFP (employer) | 8.75% | uncapped | USD 87.50 |
| INSAFORP (training levy) | 1% | total payroll (employers with ≥ 1 worker subject; small-employer thresholds apply) | USD 10.00 |
| **Total employer on-cost** | **~17.25%** (at/below the ISSS cap) | | **USD 172.50** |

**Total employer cost** of a USD 1,000 employee ≈ USD 1,172.50/month (before aguinaldo and vacation accruals). [INSAFORP threshold — **RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current small-employer exemption.**]

## Section 6 -- Minimum Wage, Aguinaldo, Vacation

### Minimum Wage (2025)

| Sector | Monthly (USD) |
|---|---|
| Commerce & services | 408.80 |
| Industry / manufacturing | 408.80 |
| Textile / apparel (maquila) | 359.16 |
| Agriculture | 272.66 |

Minimum wages are set by sector by the Consejo Nacional del Salario Mínimo. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current sector schedule and any 2026 revision.]** (Ministerio de Trabajo)

### Aguinaldo (Christmas Bonus) — mandatory

Paid between 12 and 20 December, scaled by completed years of service:

| Service | Aguinaldo |
|---|---|
| 1 -- < 3 years | 15 days' salary |
| 3 -- < 10 years | 19 days' salary |
| 10+ years | 21 days' salary |

Aguinaldo is exempt from ISR up to a statutory limit (two minimum monthly wages of the commerce sector); the excess is taxable. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the current exempt limit.]** (Código de Trabajo arts. 196–202)

### Vacation

15 days after each completed year of service, plus a **30% vacation premium** (prima vacacional) on the corresponding salary. (Código de Trabajo art. 177)

---

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples (gross-to-net)

### Example 1 — Minimum-wage employee (gross USD 408.80)

- ISSS employee: 3% × 408.80 = **USD 12.26**
- AFP employee: 7.25% × 408.80 = **USD 29.64**
- ISR base = 408.80 − 12.26 − 29.64 = **366.90** ≤ 550 → **USD 0.00 retención**
- **Net pay = 408.80 − 12.26 − 29.64 = USD 366.90**

### Example 2 — Mid salary (gross USD 1,000)

- ISSS employee: 3% × min(1,000, 1,000 cap) = **USD 30.00**
- AFP employee: 7.25% × 1,000 = **USD 72.50**
- ISR base = 1,000 − 30.00 − 72.50 = **897.50** → Tramo III: 60.00 + 20% × (897.50 − 895.24) = 60.00 + 0.45 = **USD 60.45**
- **Net pay = 1,000 − 30.00 − 72.50 − 60.45 = USD 837.05**
- Employer on-cost: ISSS 75.00 + AFP 87.50 + INSAFORP 10.00 = **USD 172.50** → total cost **USD 1,172.50**

### Example 3 — High earner (gross USD 2,500)

- ISSS employee: capped → **USD 30.00** (base frozen at USD 1,000)
- AFP employee: 7.25% × 2,500 = **USD 181.25** (no cap)
- ISR base = 2,500 − 30.00 − 181.25 = **2,288.75** → Tramo IV: 288.57 + 30% × (2,288.75 − 2,038.10) = 288.57 + 75.20 = **USD 363.77**
- **Net pay = 2,500 − 30.00 − 181.25 − 363.77 = USD 1,924.98**

## Section 8 -- Payslip Requirements

The employer must issue a payslip (boleta de pago / comprobante) showing: gross salary, ISSS employee deduction, AFP employee deduction, ISR retención, any other authorised deductions, and net pay. Records are retained for inspection by the Ministerio de Trabajo and DGII.

---

## Section 9 -- Filing & Payment Obligations

| Obligation | Form / channel | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| ISR retención (monthly) | DGII — declaración mensual de pago a cuenta e impuesto retenido (**F-14**) | Within 10 working days of month-end |
| Annual statement of withholdings | DGII — informe anual de retenciones (**F-910**) | 31 January (following year) |
| ISSS planilla (monthly) | ISSS portal (SEPS) | Per ISSS calendar (monthly) |
| AFP planilla (monthly) | AFP / SSF electronic planilla | Monthly |

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact current form numbers and deadlines against the DGII and ISSS portals.]**

## Section 10 -- Common Payroll Patterns (bank statement / accounting)

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| PLANILLA, NÓMINA, PAGO SALARIO, ABONO NÓMINA | Net salary disbursement |
| ISSS, SEGURO SOCIAL | ISSS remittance (employer + employee health) |
| AFP CRECER, AFP CONFÍA, PENSIÓN | AFP pension remittance |
| DGII, HACIENDA, PAGO A CUENTA, RETENCIÓN | ISR retención / pago a cuenta to Hacienda |
| INSAFORP | Training levy (employer 1%) |
| AGUINALDO | Mandatory Christmas bonus (Dec) |

---

## Section 11 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (this skill) | **el-salvador-payroll.md** |
| Self-employed / individual income tax (F-11, Art. 37 annual table) | el-salvador-income-tax.md |
| Employer & self-insured social/pension rates, annual PIT table | el-salvador-social-contributions.md |
| El Salvador IVA (13%) | el-salvador-vat (consumption tax) |

**Handoff:** the employee FS-equivalent annual figures (gross, ISR withheld, ISSS, AFP) feed the individual's annual ISR settlement on Form F-11 if the employee has other income or claims a refund.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the ISR retención table to gross salary — the base is gross − ISSS − AFP (employee).
- NEVER compute ISSS on salary above USD 1,000 — both employee (USD 30) and employer (USD 75) are capped at the USD 1,000 base.
- NEVER cap AFP — the contributory-base ceiling was removed in January 2023; AFP applies to the full salary.
- NEVER omit the employer INSAFORP 1% training levy from the true employer cost.
- NEVER omit the mandatory aguinaldo (Dec) or the 30% vacation premium from annual labour cost.
- NEVER treat the USD 550 monthly exemption as USD 472 — that pre-2025 figure was superseded by Decreto Ejecutivo 10.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Salvadoran contador.
