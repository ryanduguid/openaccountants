## Section 8 -- Foreign Founder Considerations

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Non-resident directors allowed? | Yes, but NIE (Número de Identidad de Extranjero) required |
| NIE for incorporation | Mandatory before notary appointment; obtainable at Spanish consulate or police station |
| Physical presence required? | Yes for notary (power of attorney possible but must be notarised and apostilled) |
| Apostille requirements | Foreign documents require apostille + sworn Spanish translation |
| Autónomo obligation | Foreign administradores must register as autónomo societario with Seguridad Social |
| EU/non-EU differences | EU citizens: simpler NIE process; non-EU: may need visa depending on activity |

---

## Section 9 -- Common Mistakes and Refusals

**R-ES-F1 -- Capital of €1 without understanding consequences.** "While €1 is the legal minimum since 2022, capitals below €3,000 trigger mandatory profit-reserve rules and potential joint director liability. Always advise on these constraints before proceeding."

**R-ES-F2 -- Forgetting autónomo societario obligation.** "The administrador of an S.L. must register as autónomo societario and pay social security contributions (~€370/month in 2026). This is a significant ongoing cost that founders frequently overlook."

**R-ES-F3 -- Not depositing annual accounts.** "Failure to deposit cuentas anuales with the Registro Mercantil results in the company being unable to file new deeds (cierre registral) and potential fines up to €60,000."

**R-ES-F4 -- NIE not obtained before notary appointment.** "All founders and directors must have a valid NIE before the notary can execute the escritura. This is the most common cause of delay for foreign founders."

**R-ES-F5 -- Shell company request.** "This skill will not assist in forming a company without genuine economic substance. Spanish anti-money-laundering regulations require identification of beneficial owners and real business activity."

## Section 10 -- Timeline

| Step | Duration | Cumulative |
|---|---|---|
| Obtain NIE (if foreign founder) | 1--6 weeks | Day 1--42 |
| Name reservation (certificación negativa) | 1--3 days | Day 2--45 |
| Draft estatutos and prepare documents | 1--3 days | Day 3--48 |
| Open bank account and deposit capital | 1--5 days | Day 4--53 |
| Notary appointment (escritura) | 1 day | Day 5--54 |
| CIF provisional (AEAT) | 1 day | Day 6--55 |
| Registro Mercantil registration | 5--15 days | Day 11--70 |
| Social security registration | 1--3 days | Day 12--73 |
| **Ready to trade** | | **~2--4 weeks (with NIE already in hand)** |

The bottleneck for foreign founders is obtaining the NIE, which should be started well in advance.
