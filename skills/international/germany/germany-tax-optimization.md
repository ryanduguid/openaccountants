# Germany Tax Optimization -- Self-Employed Skill v1.0

---

## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Germany (Bundesrepublik Deutschland) |
| Key optimization legislation | Einkommensteuergesetz (EStG) -- particularly §4 (Betriebsausgaben), §7g (Investitionsabzugsbetrag), §6 Abs. 2/2a (GWG), §9 (Werbungskosten), §10 (Sonderausgaben), §10a (Riester), §10d (Verlustvortrag/-rücktrag), §35a (haushaltsnahe Dienstleistungen) |
| Tax authority attitude to planning | The Finanzamt accepts legitimate tax planning (Steuergestaltung). Germany has no statutory GAAR, but §42 AO (Abgabenordnung) provides a general anti-abuse rule: tax arrangements that constitute an "abuse of design options" (Gestaltungsmissbrauch) can be disregarded. Courts apply substance-over-form principles. |
| Currency | EUR |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 Jan -- 31 Dec) |
| Filing deadline | 31 July of the following year (tax advisor-assisted: end of February of the second following year) |

### Income Tax Rates 2026

| Taxable income (EUR) | Marginal rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 12,348 | 0% (Grundfreibetrag) |
| 12,349 -- 17,799 | 14% -- 24% (linear progression) |
| 17,800 -- 69,878 | 24% -- 42% (linear progression) |
| 69,879 -- 277,825 | 42% (Spitzensteuersatz) |
| 277,826+ | 45% (Reichensteuersatz) |

Plus Solidaritätszuschlag (5.5% of income tax, only for higher incomes above threshold) and Kirchensteuer (8-9% of income tax, if applicable).

## Section 2 -- Income Splitting & Structuring

### Ehegattensplitting (Spousal Income Splitting)

| Strategy | Detail | Legislation |
|---|---|---|
| Joint assessment (Zusammenveranlagung) | Married couples/civil partners can combine income, halve it, apply the rate table, then double the resulting tax. Massive benefit when incomes are unequal. | EStG §26, §26b, §32a Abs. 5 |
| Optimal Steuerklasse | Choose Steuerklasse III/V or IV/IV depending on income split. III/V benefits the higher earner's cash flow. | EStG §38b |

### Sole Proprietorship vs GmbH

| Factor | Einzelunternehmen (sole trader) | GmbH |
|---|---|---|
| Top marginal rate | 45% + Soli + KiSt | 15% KSt + 5.5% Soli + ~14% GewSt = ~30% |
| When to incorporate | When profits consistently exceed ~EUR 60,000 and can be retained. Extraction via salary (deductible) or dividends (25% Abgeltungsteuer + Soli). | EStG §20 Abs. 1 Nr. 1; KStG §1 |

### Employing Family Members (Ehegatten-Arbeitsverhältnis)

Salary to a spouse is deductible as Betriebsausgabe if the employment relationship is genuine, at arm's length, and actually performed. The BFH requires: written contract, regular payment to own bank account, and duties commensurate with salary.

**Legislation:** EStG §4 Abs. 4; BFH case law

---

## Section 3 -- Deductions Most People Miss

| Deduction | Legislation | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home office (Homeoffice-Pauschale) | EStG §4 Abs. 5 Nr. 6c | EUR 6/day, max 210 days = EUR 1,260/year. No documentation of actual costs needed. Alternatively, full costs if dedicated room is Mittelpunkt (center) of professional activity. |
| Dedicated home office (häusliches Arbeitszimmer) | EStG §4 Abs. 5 Nr. 6b | If the room is the center of all professional activity, actual costs (proportional rent, utilities, insurance) are fully deductible, or the Jahrespauschale of EUR 1,260. From 2026: stricter documentation required (BFH ruling). |
| Commuting allowance (Entfernungspauschale) | EStG §9 Abs. 1 Nr. 4 | EUR 0.30/km for first 20 km, EUR 0.38/km from 21st km, one way, per working day. |
| Professional development | EStG §4 Abs. 4, §9 | Courses, seminars, conferences, books, trade journals -- fully deductible if related to current profession. |
| Professional association dues | EStG §9 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 | Berufsverband, Kammer, Gewerkschaft -- fully deductible. |
| Work equipment (Arbeitsmittel) | EStG §9 Abs. 1 Nr. 6 | Laptop, monitor, desk, chair, phone -- fully deductible if exclusively/predominantly for business. Mixed-use items at business-use %. |
| Telephone & internet | EStG §4 Abs. 4 | Business-use proportion. Simplified: 20% of costs, max EUR 20/month without documentation. |
| Travel expenses (Reisekosten) | EStG §4 Abs. 5, §9 Abs. 1 Nr. 5a | Actual costs or Pauschale: EUR 28/day (full day away), EUR 14/day (>8 hours). Overnight: actual costs. |
| Insurance premiums (business) | EStG §4 Abs. 4 | Professional liability, legal expenses insurance (business), business interruption. |
| Contributions to professional chambers | EStG §4 Abs. 4 | IHK, Handwerkskammer, Steuerberaterkammer, etc. |
| Double household (doppelte Haushaltsführung) | EStG §9 Abs. 1 Nr. 5 | If maintaining a second household for work: rent up to EUR 1,000/month + travel costs. |
| Relocation costs (Umzugskosten) | EStG §9 Abs. 1 | If job-related relocation: actual costs or Umzugskostenpauschale. |

## Section 4 -- Capital Allowances Optimization

### Investitionsabzugsbetrag (IAB) -- §7g EStG

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| What | Deduct up to 50% of the anticipated acquisition cost of a future asset BEFORE purchasing it |
| Limit | EUR 200,000 total across all active IABs (rolling 4-year window) |
| Timeline | Investment must occur within 3 years |
| Business use requirement | ≥ 90% business use in year of acquisition and the following year |
| Strategy | Claim IAB to reduce current-year profit, then purchase the asset within 3 years. Effectively shifts the deduction earlier. |

### Geringwertige Wirtschaftsgüter (GWG) -- §6 Abs. 2 EStG

| Method | Threshold | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Sofortabschreibung (immediate write-off) | Up to EUR 800 (net) | Full deduction in year of purchase. No depreciation schedule. |
| Sammelposten (pool depreciation) | EUR 250 -- EUR 1,000 (net) | Pool all items, depreciate over 5 years straight-line. Alternative to individual depreciation. |
| Standard AfA | Over EUR 800/1,000 | Depreciate over useful life per AfA-Tabelle. |

**Strategy:** For items under EUR 800 net, always use Sofortabschreibung. For items EUR 800-1,000, compare Sammelposten (5 years) vs individual AfA -- choose whichever gives faster write-off.

### Sonderabschreibung (Special Depreciation) -- §7g Abs. 5 EStG

Up to 20% additional depreciation in the year of acquisition and the following 4 years (on top of normal AfA). Combined with IAB, this allows extremely front-loaded deductions.

**Requirements:** Business assets ≤ EUR 200,000 at end of prior year (or profits ≤ EUR 200,000 for Freiberufler).

---

## Section 5 -- Loss Utilization

**Legislation:** EStG §10d

| Relief | Detail | Limit |
|---|---|---|
| Verlustrücktrag (carry-back) | Losses can be carried back to the immediately preceding year | EUR 10,000,000 (single) / EUR 20,000,000 (joint) -- permanently raised |
| Verlustvortrag (carry-forward) | Losses carried forward indefinitely | Full offset up to EUR 1,000,000; 60% of remaining income (Mindestbesteuerung) |
| Intra-year offset (Verlustausgleich) | Losses from one income category offset gains in other categories within the same year | No limit for horizontal offset; vertical offset generally unrestricted |
| IAB as virtual loss | IAB under §7g reduces profit and can create or increase a loss that triggers carry-back/forward | Subject to IAB limits |

### Strategy

Use the IAB to create a loss in a high-income year by claiming future investment deductions. Carry back excess losses to the prior year for an immediate refund (Verlustücktrag). The 2022-permanent increase to EUR 10 million carry-back makes this extremely powerful for larger businesses.

---

## Section 6 -- Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Defer invoicing | For Einnahme-Überschuss-Rechnung (EÜR/cash basis) taxpayers, defer invoicing to January to shift income to the next year. |
| Accelerate expenses | Prepay insurance, subscriptions, training before 31 December. Under §11 EStG (Zufluss-/Abflussprinzip), expenses are deductible when paid for EÜR taxpayers. |
| IAB timing | Claim IAB in a high-profit year to reduce current income by up to EUR 200,000. Purchase the asset within 3 years. |
| GWG year-end purchases | Buy business equipment under EUR 800 (net) in December for immediate full deduction. |
| Vorauszahlungen (advance tax payments) | If income drops, apply to the Finanzamt to reduce quarterly advance payments (Herabsetzungsantrag). Avoid tying up cash unnecessarily. |
| Steuerberater filing extension | Using a tax advisor extends the filing deadline to end of February of the second following year -- gives more time for planning and documentation. |
| Ehegattensplitting timing | If marrying in December, Zusammenveranlagung applies for the entire year. Marrying on 31 December gives full-year splitting benefit. |

---

## Section 7 -- VAT Optimization (Umsatzsteuer)

**Legislation:** Umsatzsteuergesetz (UStG)

| Strategy | Detail | Legislation |
|---|---|---|
| Kleinunternehmerregelung | If prior-year turnover ≤ EUR 25,000 and current-year estimated ≤ EUR 100,000, no VAT charged. No input VAT recovery. | UStG §19 |
| Opt for Regelbesteuerung | Even below threshold, opt to charge VAT if input VAT is significant (e.g., startup with heavy investment). Lock-in: 5 calendar years. | UStG §19 Abs. 2 |
| Ist-Versteuerung (cash basis VAT) | Pay output VAT only when payment is received, not when invoiced. Available if prior-year turnover ≤ EUR 800,000. | UStG §20 |
| Vorsteuerabzug timing | Claim input VAT in the period the invoice is received and paid (for EÜR). Time large purchases accordingly. | UStG §15 |
| Reverse charge for EU services | B2B services to/from other EU states: reverse charge applies. No German VAT on outgoing invoices to EU businesses. | UStG §13b |

---

## Section 8 -- Social Security Optimization

**Legislation:** Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB)

### Self-Employed Social Security

| Category | Detail |
|---|---|
| Freiberufler (liberal professions) | Generally exempt from mandatory pension insurance. Can opt for Versorgungswerk (professional pension fund) or private pension. |
| Gewerbetreibende (traders) | Generally exempt from mandatory pension insurance (unless in specific trades like craft masters). |
| Mandatory cases | Self-employed teachers, nurses, midwives, and those with only one client (scheinselbständig) -- mandatory pension contributions. |

### Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| Voluntary pension contributions | Voluntary contributions to gesetzliche Rentenversicherung (GRV) are fully deductible as Sonderausgaben under §10 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 EStG. |
| Opt for Versorgungswerk | Contributions to berufsständische Versorgungswerke are treated the same as GRV contributions for tax purposes. |
| Krankenversicherung optimization | Self-employed can choose private (PKV) or voluntary statutory (GKV). Compare costs: PKV may be cheaper when young/healthy; GKV may be better with family (free family coverage). Basis contributions are fully deductible (§10 Abs. 1 Nr. 3 EStG). |
| Beitragsbemessungsgrenze | Social security contributions are capped at the Beitragsbemessungsgrenze. Income above the ceiling incurs no additional social security cost. |

---

## Section 9 -- Investment & Retirement

### Basisrente (Rürup-Rente) -- §10 Abs. 1 Nr. 2 EStG

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Deduction limit | 100% of contributions deductible (since 2023). Max EUR 29,344 (single) / EUR 58,688 (joint) for 2026. |
| Tax treatment in retirement | Taxed as income, but typically at lower marginal rate. |
| Strategy | The primary pension vehicle for Freiberufler and Gewerbetreibende. Contributions reduce taxable income EUR-for-EUR up to the limit. At 42% marginal rate, EUR 29,344 contribution = EUR 12,325 tax saving. |

### Riester-Rente -- §10a EStG

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| Eligibility | Employees with mandatory GRV contributions (not most self-employed unless voluntarily contributing). |
| Maximum deduction | EUR 2,100/year as Sonderausgaben |
| Zulagen (allowances) | EUR 175 base + EUR 185-300/child |
| Strategy | Only relevant for self-employed who voluntarily contribute to GRV. Compare Zulage benefit vs Sonderausgabenabzug. |

### Vermögenswirksame Leistungen (VWL) and Other

| Vehicle | Tax benefit | Legislation |
|---|---|---|
| Sparer-Pauschbetrag | EUR 1,000 (single) / EUR 2,000 (joint) tax-free investment income | EStG §20 Abs. 9 |
| Abgeltungsteuer | 25% flat tax on capital gains and investment income (+ Soli + KiSt) | EStG §32d |
| Günstigerprüfung | If marginal rate < 25%, apply for taxation at marginal rate instead of Abgeltungsteuer | EStG §32d Abs. 6 |

---

## Section 10 -- Red Lines

| Risk | Detail |
|---|---|
| §42 AO (Gestaltungsmissbrauch) | Arrangements that serve no purpose other than tax reduction can be disregarded by the Finanzamt. |
| Scheinselbständigkeit | If effectively an employee of one client, reclassification triggers full social security contributions and back-payments. |
| IAB without investment intent | If the investment is not made within 3 years, the IAB is reversed with interest (§233a AO: 0.5%/month from 15 months after the tax year). |
| Fictitious family employment | Spouse/family employment must be genuine: written contract, actual work, arm's-length salary, regular payment. BFH scrutinizes closely. |
| Private expenses as business | The Finanzamt will disallow expenses that are not exclusively or predominantly business-related. Mixed-use items require documented apportionment. |
| Liebhaberei (hobby) | If a business consistently makes losses with no realistic profit expectation, the Finanzamt may reclassify it as Liebhaberei and disallow all losses. |
| Excessive Homeoffice claims | From 2026, the BFH requires comprehensive documentation: room sketches, usage logs, actual cost receipts. |
