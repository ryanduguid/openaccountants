### Resident Individual Income Tax Bands (Year of Assessment 2022 Onwards — current for 2025)

**Resident Individual Income Tax Bands**  _(Source: FRCS Tax Rates page (table header "Year of Assessment 2022 Onwards") — https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/ ; FRCS Personal Income Tax page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/personal-income-tax/)_

| Chargeable income (FJD) | Income tax | Cumulative tax at top |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 -- 30,000 | Nil (tax-free threshold) | $0 |
| 30,001 -- 50,000 | 18% of excess over 30,000 | $3,600 |
| 50,001 -- 270,000 | 3,600 + 20% of excess over 50,000 | $47,600 |
| 270,001 -- 300,000 | 47,600 + 20% of excess over 270,000 | $53,600 |
| 300,001 -- 350,000 | 53,600 + 20% of excess over 300,000 | $63,600 |
| 350,001 -- 400,000 | 63,600 + 20% of excess over 350,000 | $73,600 |
| 400,001 -- 450,000 | 73,600 + 20% of excess over 400,000 | $83,600 |
| 450,001 -- 500,000 | 83,600 + 20% of excess over 450,000 | $93,600 |
| 500,001 -- 1,000,000 | 93,600 + 20% of excess over 500,000 | $193,600 |
| 1,000,001+ | 193,600 + 20% of excess over 1,000,000 | -- |

- **Effective marginal rate** — Effective marginal income-tax rate is a flat 20% on all chargeable income above $50,000. SRT and ECAL (below) add further tax above $270,000.  _(FRCS Tax Rates page — https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/)_

### Social Responsibility Tax (SRT) — additional tax on chargeable income above FJD 270,000

SRT applies ONLY to the portion of chargeable income exceeding $270,000.

**SRT table**  _(Source: FRCS Tax Rates page (SRT column) — https://frcs.org.fj/tax-rates-and-codes/ ; FRCS SRT overview — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/social-responsibility-tax-srt/)_

| Chargeable income (FJD) | SRT | Cumulative SRT at top |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 270,001 -- 300,000 | 18% of excess over 270,000 | $5,400 |
| 300,001 -- 350,000 | 5,400 + 19% of excess over 300,000 | $14,900 |
| 350,001 -- 400,000 | 14,900 + 20% of excess over 350,000 | $24,900 |
| 400,001 -- 450,000 | 24,900 + 21% of excess over 400,000 | $35,400 |
| 450,001 -- 500,000 | 35,400 + 22% of excess over 450,000 | $46,400 |
| 500,001 -- 1,000,000 | 46,400 + 23% of excess over 500,000 | $161,400 |
| 1,000,001+ | 161,400 + 24% of excess over 1,000,000 | -- |

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] First SRT band (270,001–300,000): FRCS current tax-rates summary shows 18%, while a superseded FRCS 2020/2021 PAYE PDF showed 13% for that band (the 2024 budget restructured SRT). The 18% figure from the current FRCS tax-rates page is treated as authoritative for 2025 here; confirm against the live FRCS PAYE/SRT/ECAL table before publishing/filing.

### Environment & Climate Adaptation Levy (ECAL) on income

- **ECAL on personal income** — flat 5% of chargeable income exceeding $270,000 (reduced from 10% to 5%). Applies above the $270,000 threshold across all higher bands.  _(Source: FRCS 2020/2021 PAYE PDF (each ECAL row "5% of excess over 270,000") — https://www.frcs.org.fj/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-2021-PAYE-Final-Tax.pdf ; reduction 10%→5% confirmed via FRCS SRT page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/social-responsibility-tax-srt/)_

Note: ECAL also applies separately as a 5% levy on prescribed services (a consumption levy distinct from the income levy) — out of scope for this personal income tax skill.

### Non-Resident Individuals

- **Non-resident flat rate** — Flat 20% on Fiji-sourced chargeable income from the first dollar — no tax-free threshold.  _(Source: FRCS Personal Income Tax page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/personal-income-tax/)_

### FNPF — Fiji National Provident Fund (mandatory social security / pension)

Compulsory contribution on gross wages, effective 1 January 2024 (reverted from pandemic-era reduced rate):

**FNPF rates**  _(Source: FNPF Employers page — https://myfnpf.com.fj/employers/ ; FBC News (18% restoration) — https://www.fbcnews.com.fj/news/fnpf-18-contribution-restored-civil-service-pay-review/)_

| Party | Rate of gross wages |
| --- | --- |
| Employee | 8% |
| Employer | 10% |
| **Total** | **18%** |

Component check: 8% (employee) + 10% (employer) = 18% total ✓. Contributions calculated on gross earnings, payable monthly.

- **Compulsory contribution wage ceiling** — [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] — no compulsory cap was confirmed on FNPF's official site; state as none/unconfirmed rather than assuming one.
- **Voluntary / additional contribution cap** — FJD 250,000 per financial year, effective 1 February 2025 (gazetted 31 Jan 2025)  _(FNPF — https://myfnpf.com.fj/2025/02/19/fnpf-reverts-to-old-voluntary-and-additional-contribution-limit/)_
- **FNPF employee contribution deductibility** — Employee FNPF contributions are deductible when computing taxable income. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] deductibility limits/conditions against current FRCS individual guidance.

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | STOP — do not apply a rate table without confirming resident vs non-resident |
| Unknown whether income exceeds $270,000 | Assume below until confirmed; apply SRT/ECAL only when confirmed above |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT registration | Not registered (turnover under $100,000) |
| Unknown asset useful life / depreciation rate | Flag for reviewer; do not guess a rate |
| Unknown whether expense is entertainment/personal | Treat as not deductible |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

Minimum viable -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residency status (resident/non-resident) and taxpayer type (sole trader / business individual, or wage earner).

Recommended -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, FNPF contribution records, prior year PIT return or FRCS assessment, VAT registration status, TIN.

Ideal -- complete income and expenditure account, asset/depreciation register, provisional tax payment confirmations, employment income details (for combined employment + business income, PIT class "B").

Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN. No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This Fiji PIT computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and meet the wholly-and-exclusively test under the Income Tax Act 2015."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-FJ-1** — Residency status unknown. "Residency determines whether the tax-free threshold and progressive bands apply (resident) or a flat 20% from the first dollar applies (non-resident). This skill cannot compute tax without confirming residency. Please confirm before proceeding."
- **R-FJ-2** — Companies / partnerships. "This skill covers individuals and sole traders only. Companies (25% CIT) and partnerships file separate returns. Escalate to a Fiji-licensed practitioner."
- **R-FJ-3** — High earners above FJD 270,000. "Chargeable income above $270,000 triggers SRT and ECAL in addition to income tax, and the first SRT band rate is currently unconfirmed in this skill. Flag for reviewer before computing — do not finalise SRT/ECAL without confirming the live FRCS table."
- **R-FJ-4** — Capital gains / asset disposals. "Capital Gains Tax (10%) computations require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a Fiji-licensed practitioner."
- **R-FJ-5** — Arrears / enforcement. "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to FRCS debt management action. Late-payment penalty (25%) plus 5% per month interest is severe. Do not advise. Escalate to a Fiji-licensed practitioner immediately."
- **R-FJ-6** — VAT return requested. "This skill covers income tax (PIT/SRT/ECAL) only. Fiji VAT (15%, threshold FJD 100,000) is a separate workflow."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

How to read this table. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (VAT-registered)

Input line:
`15/03/2025 ; BSP TRANSFER IN ; PACIFIC TRADING LTD ; PAYMENT INV-2025-003 ; +1,150.00 ; FJD`

Reasoning:
Client payment for services. The sole trader is VAT-registered (turnover > $100,000), so $1,150 includes 15% VAT. Net business income = 1,150 / 1.15 = $1,000.00. VAT of $150 is collected on behalf of FRCS (excluded from income — it is a liability).

Classification: Business income = $1,000.00. VAT $150.00 excluded.

### Example 2 -- SaaS Subscription (Fully Deductible)

Input line:
`01/04/2025 ; ANZ DD ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD APR ; -69.00 ; FJD`

Reasoning:
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, business use. Fully deductible operating expense. If VAT-registered, claim net of recoverable input VAT.

Classification: Deductible business expense = $69.00 (or net if VAT-registered with recoverable input VAT).

### Example 3 -- Entertainment (Flagged, Not Deductible)

Input line:
`22/04/2025 ; WESTPAC CARD ; OCEAN TERRACE RESTAURANT ; CLIENT DINNER ; -180.00 ; FJD`

Reasoning:
Client entertainment / meal. Treated as not deductible under the conservative default; entertainment is private in nature. No deduction without explicit reviewer confirmation.

Classification: NOT deductible. Exclude from expenses.

### Example 4 -- FNPF Employee Contribution

Input line:
`10/01/2025 ; BSP DD ; FNPF CONTRIBUTION ; DEC 2024 ; -240.00 ; FJD`

Reasoning:
Fiji National Provident Fund employee contribution (8% of gross wages). Deductible from taxable income as an FNPF deduction, NOT as a business expense line. (On $3,000 gross monthly wage, 8% employee share = $240.00.)

Classification: FNPF deduction = $240.00. Not a business expense.

### Example 5 -- Resident Sole Trader, Tax-Free Threshold

Input: Resident sole trader. Net business profit (chargeable income) = $25,000.

Reasoning:
$25,000 is below the $30,000 tax-free threshold, so income tax = Nil. No SRT or ECAL (income well below $270,000). FNPF/VAT separate.

Classification: Income tax due = $0.00 (within tax-free threshold).

### Example 6 -- Resident Sole Trader, Mid-Range

Input: Resident sole trader. Chargeable income = $80,000.

Reasoning:
$80,000 falls in the 50,001–270,000 band. Tax = 3,600 + 20% × (80,000 − 50,000) = 3,600 + 20% × 30,000 = 3,600 + 6,000 = $9,600. No SRT/ECAL (below $270,000).

Classification: Income tax = $9,600.00.

### Example 7 -- Non-Resident Individual

Input: Non-resident. Fiji-sourced chargeable income = $40,000.

Reasoning:
Non-residents pay a flat 20% from the first dollar, no tax-free threshold. Tax = 20% × 40,000 = $8,000.00.

Classification: Income tax = $8,000.00.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Wholly and Exclusively Test

- **Wholly and Exclusively Test** — An expense is deductible only if incurred in the production of assessable income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis. Private and domestic expenditure is not deductible.  _(Income Tax Act 2015)_

### 5.2 Revenue Recognition

- **Revenue Recognition** — All business income is assessable. For VAT-registered sole traders, report income net of the 15% VAT collected. VAT collected on sales is NOT income — it is a liability to FRCS.  _(Source: FRCS VAT page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/value-added-tax-vat/)_

### 5.3 Resident vs Non-Resident

**Resident vs Non-Resident**  _(Source: FRCS Personal Income Tax page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/personal-income-tax/)_

| Status | Basis | Threshold | Rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Resident | Worldwide income | $30,000 tax-free | Progressive (see Section 1) |
| Non-resident | Fiji-sourced only | None | Flat 20% from first dollar |

### 5.4 Capital vs Revenue

- **Capital vs Revenue** — Capital items (equipment, vehicles, furniture) are not deducted in full in the year of purchase — they are depreciated. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm depreciation/wear-and-tear rates from the Income Tax Act 2015 / FRCS guidance.] Do not apply a depreciation rate without confirmation.

### 5.5 FNPF Deduction

- **FNPF Deduction** — Employee FNPF contributions (8% of gross wages) are deductible when computing taxable income. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm any caps/conditions.] Employer contributions (10%) are a cost of employing staff, not a personal deduction.  _(Source: FNPF Employers page — https://myfnpf.com.fj/employers/)_

### 5.6 Non-Deductible Expenses

**Non-Deductible Expenses**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Entertainment / private meals | Private in nature (conservative default) |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| Capital expenditure | Depreciated, not expensed |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |

### 5.7 SRT and ECAL (Income above FJD 270,000)

**SRT and ECAL**  _(Source: FRCS SRT page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/social-responsibility-tax-srt/)_

| Tax | Applies to | Computation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SRT | Chargeable income > $270,000 | See SRT table, Section 1 (first band rate flagged as RESEARCH GAP) |
| ECAL | Chargeable income > $270,000 | Flat 5% of excess over $270,000 |

- **SRT/ECAL additional and flag** — These are ADDITIONAL to income tax. Flag any client with chargeable income above $270,000 for the reviewer (R-FJ-3).  _(Source: FRCS SRT page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/individuals/social-responsibility-tax-srt/)_

### 5.8 VAT Interaction

**VAT Interaction**

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| VAT collected on sales (registered) | NOT income — exclude (net reporting) |
| Input VAT recovered (registered) | NOT an expense — exclude |
| Not VAT-registered (turnover ≤ $100,000) | Gross amounts are income/expense; no VAT split |

- **VAT registration mandatory threshold** — VAT registration is mandatory once annual gross turnover exceeds FJD 100,000 (register within 21 days). VAT standard rate is 15% (from 1 Aug 2024).  _(Source: FRCS VAT Guide — https://www.frcs.org.fj/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/VAT-Guide-01.11.2-Online-version.pdf)_

### 5.9 Provisional Tax

- **Provisional Tax** — Business/self-employed taxpayers are subject to provisional tax (advance instalments toward the year's liability).  _(Source: FRCS Provisional Tax page — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation-section/non-individuals/reporting-and-paying-taxes/provisional-tax/)_

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] exact provisional-tax instalment percentages and due dates from the FRCS Provisional Tax page before relying on them.

### 5.10 Filing Deadline and Penalties

**Filing Deadline and Penalties**

| Item | Detail | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PIT return deadline | 31 March of following year (3 months after 31 Dec year end); statutory default, FRCS has extended in specific years (e.g. 31 May) | FRCS File On Time — https://frcs.org.fj/about-us/cis-2025-2028/key-tax-obligations/file-on-time/ |
| Late lodgement penalty | 20% of tax owing (return filed late with tax payable) | Tax Administration Act 2009 s.43; FRCS Talk Tax Sole-traders — https://www.frcs.org.fj/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/99.Talk-Tax-Soletraders-v2.pdf |
| Late payment penalty | 25% of tax not paid on time | Tax Administration Act 2009 s.44; FRCS (as above) |
| Interest on arrears | 5% per month of unpaid tax thereafter | FRCS Debt Management — https://frcs.org.fj/our-services/taxation/debt-management-service/debt-management-services-dms/ |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

- **Home Office Deduction** — Calculate proportion of home used for business (dedicated room(s) as % of total rooms or floor area). Apply that percentage to: rent, electricity (EFL), water (WAF), internet. Must be a dedicated workspace — a dual-use room does NOT qualify. Client must document the calculation and retain records. Conservative default: 0% deduction until reviewer confirms room arrangement.

### Test Suite

Test 1 -- Resident, within tax-free threshold.
Input: Resident, chargeable income $25,000.
Expected: Income tax = $0.00 (below $30,000 threshold). No SRT/ECAL.

Test 2 -- Resident, lower band.
Input: Resident, chargeable income $45,000.
Expected: 18% × (45,000 − 30,000) = 18% × 15,000 = $2,700.00.

Test 3 -- Resident, mid band.
Input: Resident, chargeable income $80,000.
Expected: 3,600 + 20% × (80,000 − 50,000) = 3,600 + 6,000 = $9,600.00. No SRT/ECAL.

Test 4 -- Resident, top of the flat-20% range.
Input: Resident, chargeable income $270,000.
Expected: 3,600 + 20% × (270,000 − 50,000) = 3,600 + 44,000 = $47,600.00. No SRT/ECAL (not above $270,000).

Test 5 -- Non-resident.
Input: Non-resident, Fiji-sourced chargeable income $40,000.
Expected: 20% × 40,000 = $8,000.00 (no tax-free threshold).

Test 6 -- VAT-registered income, net reporting.
Input: VAT-registered. Client payment $1,150 gross (incl. 15% VAT).
Expected: Business income = $1,000.00; VAT $150.00 excluded.

Test 7 -- FNPF employee contribution.
Input: Gross monthly wage $3,000, employee FNPF 8%.
Expected: FNPF deduction = $240.00 (8% × 3,000). Employer adds 10% = $300.00; total 18% = $540.00.

Test 8 -- High earner (escalation).
Input: Resident, chargeable income $400,000.
Expected: STOP / flag for reviewer (R-FJ-3) — SRT and ECAL apply above $270,000 and the first SRT band rate is a RESEARCH GAP. Do not finalise without confirming the live FRCS table.
