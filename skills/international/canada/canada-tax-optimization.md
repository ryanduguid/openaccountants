# Canada — Tax Optimization Skill v1.0

---

## Section 1 — Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Canada |
| Currency | CAD |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 January – 31 December) |
| Primary legislation | Income Tax Act (R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)) |
| Anti-avoidance | GAAR (s 245 ITA); TOSI (s 120.4) |
| Tax authority | Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) |
| Filing deadline | 30 April (employees); 15 June (self-employed, but tax owing still due 30 April) |
| Individual top federal rate | 33% (on income >$253,414) |
| Combined top rate (varies by province) | ~50–54% |
| CCPC small business rate (federal) | 9% on first $500,000 active business income |
| General corporate rate (federal) | 15% |
| Capital gains inclusion rate | 50% (66.7% increase was cancelled) |
| GST rate | 5% (HST varies by province: 13%–15%) |

### Federal Tax Brackets (2026)

| Taxable Income (CAD) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 – 57,375 | 14% |
| 57,376 – 114,750 | 20.5% |
| 114,751 – 158,468 | 26% |
| 158,469 – 220,000 | 29% |
| 220,001 – 253,414 | 33% |

Note: The lowest bracket rate was reduced to 14% (from 15%) effective 2026 via Bill C-4.

## Section 2 — Income Splitting & Structuring

### Sole Proprietor vs CCPC

**Sole proprietor:** all business income taxed at personal marginal rates. Simple, low compliance cost. Business losses offset personal income. No payroll remittances (except CPP).

**Canadian-Controlled Private Corporation (CCPC):** first $500,000 of active business income taxed at 9% federal (+ provincial, typically 2–4% = ~11–13% combined). Profits retained at corporate rate; extracted via salary or dividends. Integration principle: in theory, combined corporate + personal tax approximates personal tax alone. In practice, small gaps create planning opportunities.

**When to incorporate:** generally beneficial when annual business profit consistently exceeds ~$70,000–$80,000 and the owner can leave profits in the corporation. Below that, sole proprietorship is simpler and equally tax-efficient.

### Salary vs Dividends (CCPC Owner-Manager)

| Factor | Salary | Dividends |
|---|---|---|
| Corporate deduction | Yes | No |
| CPP contributions | Yes (creates room) | No |
| RRSP room created | Yes (18% of earned income) | No |
| Childcare expense room | Yes | No |
| Personal tax treatment | Marginal rates | Gross-up + dividend tax credit |
| Payroll admin | Required (T4, remittances) | Minimal (T5) |

**Optimal mix:** pay enough salary to maximise RRSP room ($33,810 limit for 2026 → requires ~$187,833 salary). If RRSP room is not needed, eligible dividends may produce slightly lower combined tax. Model annually — provincial rates create different break-even points.

### TOSI (Tax on Split Income) — s 120.4

Income paid to family members (spouse, children) from a related business is subject to top marginal tax rate unless an exclusion applies:
- **Excluded business:** family member works ≥20 hours/week in the business
- **Excluded shares:** family member aged 25+, owns shares of a corporation where <90% of income is from services, 10%+ equity
- **Reasonable return:** compensation proportional to labour, capital, risk contributed
- **Prescribed rate loans:** lend funds to spouse at CRA prescribed rate (3% Q1 2026); spouse invests, attributes interest income back to lender, keeps excess returns

## Section 3 — Deductions Most People Miss

| Deduction | Provision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Home office expenses | s 8(1)(f), 8(1)(i), 18(12) | Employees: T2200 required. Self-employed: proportion of rent/mortgage interest, utilities, insurance, property tax |
| Moving expenses | s 62 | Must move ≥40 km closer to new work/business location. Deduct against income at new location |
| Carrying charges | s 20(1)(c) | Interest on money borrowed to earn investment income. Includes investment counsel fees |
| Medical expenses | s 118.2 | Tax credit at 15% federal on expenses >3% of net income or $2,759 (lesser). Include premiums, dental, prescriptions, travel for treatment |
| Disability tax credit | s 118.3 | $9,872 federal credit (2026). Transferable to supporting person. Unlocks RDSP eligibility |
| Northern residents deduction | s 110.7 | Residency deduction + travel benefits for prescribed zones |
| Capital cost allowance (CCA) on rental property | s 20(1)(a), Sch II | Class 1 (4%), Class 8 (20%). Accelerated Investment Incentive (triple declining balance in year 1) |
| Apprentice mechanic tools | s 8(1)(s) | Cost exceeding $1,368 (2026 indexed) |
| Union/professional dues | s 8(1)(i) | Full deduction |
| Child care expenses | s 63 | $8,000/child under 7; $5,000/child 7–16. Must be claimed by lower-income spouse (exceptions apply) |

---

## Section 4 — Capital Allowances Optimization

### Accelerated Investment Incentive (AII)

For assets acquired after 20 November 2018 and available for use before 2028: enhanced first-year CCA. Effectively 1.5× the normal CCA rate in Year 1 (eliminates the half-year rule and adds a 50% bonus). Applies to most CCA classes.

### Key CCA Classes

| Class | Rate | Assets |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4% | Buildings acquired after 1987 |
| 8 | 20% | Furniture, fixtures, equipment, machinery |
| 10 | 30% | Motor vehicles (cost limit $37,000 + tax for passenger vehicles) |
| 10.1 | 30% | Passenger vehicles over cost limit (separate class per vehicle) |
| 12 | 100% | Computer software, tools <$500 |
| 50 | 55% | Computer hardware and systems software |
| 54 | 0% (expensed) | Zero-emission vehicles up to $61,000 + tax |

### Immediate Expensing (CCPCs)

CCPCs can immediately expense up to $1.5 million per year of eligible property (Classes 2–6, 8, 10, 12, etc.) acquired after 18 April 2021 and available for use before 2025 — verify ongoing extensions.

## Section 5 — Loss Utilization

### Non-Capital Losses

Carry back 3 years or carry forward 20 years (s 111(1)(a)). Business losses of a sole proprietor offset all personal income in the current year. Corporate losses stay in the corporation.

### Capital Losses

Net capital losses carry back 3 years or forward indefinitely (s 111(1)(b)). Can only offset capital gains. At death, net capital losses can offset any income in the year of death and prior year.

### Allowable Business Investment Losses (ABIL)

Loss on shares or debt of a small business corporation (s 38(c)). 50% of the loss is an ABIL, deductible against all income (not just capital gains). Excess becomes a non-capital loss.

### Loss Planning

- Time capital gains and losses in the same year to offset
- Crystallise unrealised losses before year-end (beware superficial loss rule: 30-day rule, s 54)
- Consider transferring losing investments to a spouse at FMV to trigger loss (but attribution rules may apply)

## Section 6 — Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| RRSP contribution by March 1 | Contributions made by 1 March deductible in prior tax year. Carry forward deduction if in lower bracket now |
| Defer income | Self-employed: delay invoicing past 31 December. Employees: defer bonuses to January |
| Accelerate deductions | Prepay deductible expenses before 31 December. Purchase CCA-eligible assets before year-end |
| Charitable donations | Carry forward donations up to 5 years. Consolidate to one spouse for higher credit rate (29%/33% on amounts >$200) |
| Capital gains deferral | Hold assets >1 year (no discount, but defer realisation). Use CCPC to shelter passive income until extraction |
| LCGE crystallisation | Trigger capital gain on QSBC shares up to $1,250,000 LCGE while still eligible. Useful before selling active business |
| Prescribed rate loan before rate increase | Lock in lower CRA prescribed rate before quarterly adjustments |

---

## Section 7 — GST/HST Optimization

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Small supplier exemption | Gross revenue ≤$30,000 in 4 consecutive quarters → no mandatory registration. But voluntary registration allows ITCs |
| Quick method | Simplified GST remittance for businesses ≤$400,000 revenue. Remit a reduced percentage; keep the difference. Often advantageous for service businesses with few inputs |
| Input Tax Credits (ITCs) | Claim GST/HST on business purchases. Documentation requirements: supplier name/BN, invoice date, total, GST amount |
| ITCs on vehicles | Claim proportional to business use. Maintain logbook |
| Real property | Self-supply rules on real property conversions. New residential property GST/HST rebate ($350,000–$450,000 threshold) |
| Place of supply | GST vs HST depends on province of delivery. Optimise for lower-rate provinces where legitimately possible |
| Zero-rated exports | Exports are zero-rated (0% GST) but ITCs on inputs still claimable |

---

## Section 8 — CPP/EI & Social Security Optimization

### CPP Contributions (2026)

- **CPP1:** 5.95% employee + 5.95% employer on pensionable earnings $3,500–$73,200 (max employee contribution ~$4,147)
- **CPP2:** 4% employee + 4% employer on earnings $73,200–$81,200 (second ceiling)
- Self-employed pay both halves (11.9% CPP1 + 8% CPP2)
- CCPC owner-manager paying dividends only: no CPP contributions → no CPP pension accrual. Trade-off: lower current cost vs lower retirement benefit

### EI Premiums

- Employees: 1.64% on insurable earnings up to $65,700 (2026)
- Self-employed: can opt in for special benefits (maternity, sickness)
- CCPC dividends: no EI — but also no EI eligibility

### Optimisation

- If owner-manager does not need CPP/EI benefits, dividends avoid these premiums (~$6,000+ annual saving)
- If building CPP entitlement, pay minimum salary to maximise CPP credits
- Balance against RRSP room generation (requires earned income)

## Section 9 — Investment & Retirement

| Account | 2026 Limit | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| RRSP | $33,810 (or 18% of prior-year earned income) | Contributions deductible; growth tax-deferred; withdrawals taxed as income |
| TFSA | $7,000 (cumulative $109,000 since 2009) | No deduction; growth and withdrawals tax-free |
| FHSA | $8,000/year ($40,000 lifetime) | Deductible like RRSP + tax-free withdrawal for first home (like TFSA). Best of both worlds |
| RESP | $2,500/year to maximise CESG ($500 grant) | No deduction; growth tax-deferred; grants from government; withdrawals taxed to student |
| RDSP | Up to $200,000 lifetime | Government grants/bonds up to $3,500/year. Must have DTC |

### Strategy Framework

1. **FHSA first** if qualifying first-time buyer — deductible AND tax-free withdrawal
2. **Employer RRSP match** — capture free money before any other investment
3. **TFSA** — fill annually, especially if in a lower bracket now (preserve RRSP room for higher-income years)
4. **RRSP** — maximise in years with high marginal rate, plan to withdraw in lower-rate retirement
5. **RESP** — trigger CESG grant ($500/child/year)
6. **Non-registered** — use Canadian eligible dividends and capital gains (50% inclusion) for tax efficiency

## Section 10 — Red Lines (GAAR & Scrutiny Triggers)

### GAAR (s 245 ITA)

Applies when a transaction (i) results in a tax benefit, (ii) is an avoidance transaction (not primarily for bona fide non-tax purposes), and (iii) is abusive — misuses or frustrates the provisions of the Act. Consequence: tax benefit denied; potential penalties.

### CRA Scrutiny Triggers

| Trigger | Risk |
|---|---|
| TOSI-offending dividends to family members | Top-rate tax + interest |
| Superficial losses (repurchase within 30 days) | Loss denied (s 54) |
| Excessive salary to family members not working in business | TOSI + reasonableness challenge |
| Personal expenses through corporation | Shareholder benefit (s 15(1)) or deemed dividend (s 15(2)) |
| Automobile benefits | Standby charge + operating benefit if personal use not properly reported |
| Non-arm's length transactions at non-FMV | Transfer pricing rules (s 69, s 247) |
| Foreign reporting non-compliance | T1135 (≥$100,000 foreign property). Penalties: $2,500/year late filing |
| Underground economy / unreported income | CRA uses third-party data matching |
| RRSP over-contribution | 1% per month penalty tax on excess >$2,000 |
| Aggressive tax shelters | CRA mandatory disclosure rules (s 237.3, 237.4) — expanded 2023 |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- NEVER advise claiming personal expenses as business deductions
- NEVER advise hiding income or assets offshore without proper disclosure (T1135, T1134)
- NEVER advise ignoring TOSI rules when splitting income with family members
- NEVER advise repurchasing securities within 30 days to trigger a loss (superficial loss)
- NEVER advise backdating transactions or documentation

## Section 11 — Annual Tax Planning Calendar

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| January | New TFSA room available ($7,000). Review prescribed rate for spousal loans. Ensure FHSA contribution on track |
| February | Final month for prior-year RRSP contribution (deadline 1 March). Model optimal RRSP vs TFSA split |
| March 1 | RRSP contribution deadline for prior-year deduction |
| April 30 | Personal tax return filing deadline. Tax balance owing due. CPP/EI self-employed remittance due |
| June 15 | Filing deadline for self-employed (but tax was due April 30) |
| June 30 | CCPC fiscal year-end (if elected). Review salary vs dividend mix |
| September | Model year-end tax position. Review quarterly instalment obligations |
| October–November | Execute capital gains/loss harvesting. Make charitable donations. Prepay deductible expenses |
| December 31 | **Critical date.** TFSA contributions. RESP contributions to trigger CESG. SRS/RRSP contributions for current year. Year-end trust distributions. Ensure T5013 / T3 slips timing. Pay salary/bonus before year-end for earned income |

## Section 12 — Cash Impact Examples

### Example 1 — CCPC Salary vs Dividend Mix (Ontario, 2026)

**Scenario:** CCPC earns $200,000 active business income. Owner is sole shareholder.

**All salary ($200,000):** Corporate tax $0 (fully deductible). Personal tax ~$52,700 (Ontario combined). CPP: ~$8,300. RRSP room created: $33,810. **Net after tax: ~$138,000.**

**All eligible dividends:** Corporate tax at ~12.2% = $24,400. Remaining $175,600 as dividends. Personal tax on grossed-up dividends ~$25,200. No CPP. No RRSP room. **Net after tax: ~$150,400. Saving: ~$12,400** but no CPP accrual or RRSP room.

**Optimal blend:** $100,000 salary + remainder as dividend. Balance of RRSP room, CPP accrual, and tax efficiency.

### Example 2 — TFSA vs RRSP

**Profile:** 30-year-old earning $60,000 (20.5% federal bracket).

**RRSP $7,000:** tax refund ~$1,435 (20.5%). Invested for 30 years at 6% → $40,159 (pre-tax). Withdrawal at 14% bracket → $34,537 net. **Advantage: $8,102 vs taxable.**

**TFSA $7,000:** no refund. Same growth → $40,159. Withdrawal tax-free = $40,159 net. **Advantage: $5,622 more than RRSP if future bracket is similar.**

### Example 3 — LCGE on Business Sale

Owner sells qualifying small business corporation shares. Capital gain: $1,000,000. LCGE shelters the full gain (within $1,250,000 lifetime limit). Tax at 50% inclusion × 33% rate = $165,000 avoided. **Cash saving: $165,000.**
