## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

- **Minimum viable inputs** — territory of residence on Dec 31 (must be Nunavut), federal taxable income (T1 line 26000), federal net income.
- **Recommended inputs** — marital status, spouse income, children, Inuit beneficiary status under Nunavut Agreement, T1 line 23600 (for Cost of Living credit).
- **Ideal inputs** — complete T1 data, prior NU428, GN credit assessments.

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-NU-1** — Province/territory is not Nunavut on December 31. (Not Nunavut resident.)  _(R-NU-1)_
- **R-NU-2** — Individual sole proprietors only. (Corporations/trusts.)  _(R-NU-2)_
- **R-NU-3** — Escalate. Apply NU rates only to the period of Nunavut residency. (Part-year resident.)  _(R-NU-3)_
- **R-NU-4** — Escalate. Nunavut has no Indian Act reserves but specific Nunavut Agreement provisions may apply to Inuit beneficiaries. (Income earned on reserve under s. 87 Indian Act.)  _(R-NU-4)_

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

Nunavut tax is computed from federal return data. Transaction classification is in `ca-fed-t2125`.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Low Income

**Input:** Taxable income $22,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- Gross Nunavut tax: $22,000 × 4.00% = $880.00
- BPA credit: $19,274 × 4.00% = $770.96
- Basic NU tax before Cost of Living credit: $109.04
- Cost of Living basic credit ($12,000 × 4%) = $480.00
- Net NU tax: −$370.96 (refundable to taxpayer)

### Example 2 -- Mid-Range

**Input:** Taxable income $85,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $54,707 at 4.00% = $2,188.28
- $30,293 at 7.00% = $2,120.51
- Gross NU tax: $4,308.79
- BPA credit: $770.96
- Basic NU tax: $3,537.83
- Cost of Living basic ($480.00) plus partial supplementary; net NU tax approximately $2,800 (verify supplementary formula).

### Example 3 -- High Income

**Input:** Taxable income $300,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $54,707 at 4.00% = $2,188.28
- $54,706 at 7.00% = $3,829.42
- $68,468 at 9.00% = $6,162.12
- $122,119 at 11.50% = $14,043.69
- Gross NU tax: $26,223.51
- BPA credit: $770.96
- Basic NU tax: $25,452.55
- Cost of Living credit fully phased out.

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### EC-NU-1: Cost of Living Tax Credit supplementary formula

- **EC-NU-1** — Verify the current NU479 supplementary formula from the GN Department of Finance before computing. Conservative default: report basic credit only and flag supplementary as [T2].

### EC-NU-2: Northern Residents Deductions interaction

- **EC-NU-2** — Federal Northern Residents Deductions (line 25500 of T1) reduce federal taxable income for residents of prescribed northern zones. ALL of Nunavut is a prescribed northern zone. Confirm the deduction is claimed federally before computing NU428; it will lower territorial taxable income proportionally.

### EC-NU-3: Inuit beneficiary income from Nunavut Land Claims Agreement

- **EC-NU-3** — Income arising directly from the Nunavut Agreement (e.g., royalty distributions to a Designated Inuit Organization) may have specific tax treatment. Escalate.

### EC-NU-4: Mining and resource royalties

- **EC-NU-4** — If T2125 includes Nunavut mining royalty income, escalate — interactions with the Nunavut Agreement royalty mechanism are complex.

## Section 6 -- Self-checks

- [ ] Confirmed territory of residence is Nunavut on Dec 31.
- [ ] Federal taxable income reconciles to line 26000 of T1.
