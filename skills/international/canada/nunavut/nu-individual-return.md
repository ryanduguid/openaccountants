---

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Low Income

**Input:** Taxable income $22,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- Gross Nunavut tax: $22,000 × 4.00% = $880.00
- BPA credit: $19,274 × 4.00% = $770.96
- Basic NU tax before Cost of Living credit: $109.04
- Cost of Living basic credit ($12,000 × 4%) = $480.00
- Net NU tax: −$370.96 (refundable to taxpayer)

### Example 2 -- Mid-Range

**Input:** Taxable income $85,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $54,707 at 4.00% = $2,188.28
- $30,293 at 7.00% = $2,120.51
- Gross NU tax: $4,308.79
- BPA credit: $770.96
- Basic NU tax: $3,537.83
- Cost of Living basic ($480.00) plus partial supplementary; net NU tax approximately $2,800 (verify supplementary formula).

### Example 3 -- High Income

**Input:** Taxable income $300,000. Single.

**Computation:**
- $54,707 at 4.00% = $2,188.28
- $54,706 at 7.00% = $3,829.42
- $68,468 at 9.00% = $6,162.12
- $122,119 at 11.50% = $14,043.69
- Gross NU tax: $26,223.51
- BPA credit: $770.96
- Basic NU tax: $25,452.55

## Section 5 -- Edge Cases

### EC-NU-1: Cost of Living Tax Credit supplementary formula

Verify the current NU479 supplementary formula from the GN Department of Finance before computing. Conservative default: report basic credit only and flag supplementary as [T2].

### EC-NU-2: Northern Residents Deductions interaction

Federal Northern Residents Deductions (line 25500 of T1) reduce federal taxable income for residents of prescribed northern zones. ALL of Nunavut is a prescribed northern zone. Confirm the deduction is claimed federally before computing NU428; it will lower territorial taxable income proportionally.

### EC-NU-3: Inuit beneficiary income from Nunavut Land Claims Agreement

Income arising directly from the Nunavut Agreement (e.g., royalty distributions to a Designated Inuit Organization) may have specific tax treatment. Escalate.

### EC-NU-4: Mining and resource royalties

If T2125 includes Nunavut mining royalty income, escalate — interactions with the Nunavut Agreement royalty mechanism are complex.
