### Core Principle

- **Core Principle** — The CRA treats cryptocurrency as a commodity (not currency). Dispositions result in either a capital gain or business income depending on the taxpayer's circumstances.

### Capital Gains Inclusion Rate (2025)

**Capital Gains Inclusion Rate (2025)**

| Taxpayer | Inclusion Rate | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Individuals -- first $250,000 of net capital gains | 50% | Standard inclusion |
| Individuals -- gains above $250,000 | 50% | Same rate as first $250K; the proposed 66.67% increase was cancelled March 21, 2025 |
| Corporations and trusts | 50% on all gains | The proposed 66.67% rate was cancelled March 21, 2025 |

**Important:** The proposed increase to 66.67% above $250K was cancelled March 21, 2025 (confirmed in Budget 2025). The 50% inclusion rate applies to all net capital gains for individuals in 2025 — no $250K threshold distinction.

### Federal Tax Rates (2025)

**Federal Tax Rates (2025)**

| Taxable Income (CAD) | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0 -- 57,375 | 15% |
| 57,376 -- 114,750 | 20.5% |
| 114,751 -- 158,468 | 26% |
| 158,469 -- 220,000 | 29% |
| 220,001+ | 33% |

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown whether capital or business income | Treat as capital gains (lower inclusion) until evidence of business activity |
| Unknown ACB | $0 (maximum gain) -- obtain records |
| Unknown acquisition date | No holding period benefit claimed |
| Unknown fair market value at acquisition | Use reputable exchange rate at date/time |

## Section 2 -- Classification Rules

### 2.1 Capital Gains vs Business Income

**2.1 Capital Gains vs Business Income**

| Factor | Capital (Investor) | Business Income (Trader) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frequency of transactions | Occasional | High volume, systematic |
| Holding period | Extended (weeks/months/years) | Very short (minutes/hours/days) |
| Knowledge/expertise | General interest | Deep market knowledge, technical analysis |
| Time devoted | Part-time/casual | Significant daily commitment |
| Financing | Own capital | Leveraged/borrowed funds |
| Advertising/promotion | None | May promote activity |
| Nature of assets | Long-term hold for appreciation | Quick turnover for profit |
| Tax treatment | 50% inclusion | 100% income (fully taxable) |
| Loss treatment | Capital losses (only offset gains) | Business losses (offset all income) |

The CRA applies a holistic test. No single factor is determinative.

### 2.2 Disposition Events

A disposition occurs when:

**2.2 Disposition Events**

| Event | Disposition? |
| --- | --- |
| Sell crypto for CAD (or fiat) | Yes |
| Trade crypto for another crypto | Yes -- barter transaction |
| Use crypto to purchase goods/services | Yes -- at FMV |
| Gift crypto | Yes -- deemed disposition at FMV |
| Donate crypto to registered charity | Yes -- but donation receipt at FMV; no capital gain if donated to qualified donee (proposed) |
| Transfer between own wallets | No -- same beneficial owner |
| Death of taxpayer | Yes -- deemed disposition at FMV |

### 2.3 Adjusted Cost Base (ACB) Tracking

- **ACB calculation method** — The ACB is calculated using the weighted average cost method (mandatory for identical properties under ITA s. 47).  _(ITA s. 47)_
- **ACB per unit** — ACB per unit = Total cost of all units acquired ÷ Total units held  _(ITA s. 47)_

**Elements included in ACB**

| Element Included in ACB | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Purchase price in CAD | Amount paid on exchange |
| Transaction/exchange fees on purchase | Coinbase fee, spread cost |
| Transfer fees (incoming) | Network/gas fees to acquire |

- **Partial disposition calculation** — When a partial disposition occurs: - Proceeds of disposition = FMV in CAD at time of sale - ACB of disposed units = (Total ACB ÷ total units) × units sold - Capital gain/loss = Proceeds − ACB of disposed units − disposition costs

### 2.4 Superficial Loss Rule (ITA s. 40(2)(g)(i))

- **Superficial loss rule** — If you sell crypto at a loss and repurchase the same crypto (or identical property) within 30 days before or after the sale (or your affiliated person acquires it), the loss is denied. The denied loss is added to the ACB of the repurchased property.  _(ITA s. 40(2)(g)(i))_

### 2.5 Staking Rewards

**2.5 Staking Rewards**

| Treatment | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| CRA position | Business income or property income (assessable when received) |
| Amount | FMV in CAD at date/time of receipt |
| ACB of received tokens | FMV at receipt (becomes cost base for future disposition) |

### 2.8 GST/HST on Crypto

**2.8 GST/HST on Crypto**

| Transaction | GST/HST Implication |
| --- | --- |
| Purchasing crypto with fiat | No GST/HST (financial instrument) |
| Selling crypto for fiat | No GST/HST |

| Mining/staking as business -- selling mined crypto | Exempt financial service (no GST/HST on sale of crypto itself) |
| Mining/staking as business -- input costs | ITC may be restricted (financial services supplier rules) |

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

### 3.1 Common Exchange Patterns (Canadian Exchanges)

### 3.3 Non-Taxable Movements

**3.3 Non-Taxable Movements**

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TRANSFER TO COLD WALLET | No tax event | Same beneficial owner |
| TRANSFER BETWEEN EXCHANGES | No tax event | Network fees add to ACB or deductible expense |
| FIAT DEPOSIT / WITHDRAWAL | No tax event | Cash movement |

## Section 4 -- Computation Method

### Step 1: Classify Activity

- **Step 1** — Determine if taxpayer is investor (capital gains) or trader (business income).

### Step 2: Build ACB Ledger

- **Step 2** — Track every acquisition: weighted average cost across all units of each crypto.

### Step 3: Calculate Gain/Loss per Disposition

- **Step 3** — Proceeds (CAD FMV) − ACB of disposed units − selling costs = gain or loss.

### Step 4: Check Superficial Loss Rule

- **Step 4** — Deny any loss where same crypto was reacquired within 30-day window.

### Step 5: Apply Inclusion Rate

- **Step 5** — - Capital gains: 50% on all net capital gains (individuals) — the proposed 66.67% rate above $250K was cancelled March 21, 2025 - Business income: 100% taxable

### Step 6: Report Staking/Mining/Airdrop Income

- **Step 6** — Separately from capital gains -- as business or property income.

### Step 7: File

- **Step 7** — - Capital gains: Schedule 3 - Business income: T2125 (Statement of Business Activities) - Other income: Line 13000

## Section 5 -- Record-Keeping Requirements

CRA requires:

**Section 5 -- Record-Keeping Requirements**

| Record | Mandatory |
| --- | --- |
| Date and time of each transaction | Yes |
| Type of transaction (buy/sell/trade/transfer) | Yes |
| Amount of crypto involved | Yes |
| FMV in CAD at time of transaction | Yes |
| Exchange or platform used | Yes |
| Wallet addresses involved | Yes |
| Running ACB calculation | Yes |
| Purpose of transaction | Yes |

- **Retention** — 6 years from the end of the tax year to which they relate.

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps

- **Crypto-to-Crypto Swaps** — Each swap is a barter transaction. The disposition of crypto A is at the FMV of crypto B received (or FMV of A given up, whichever is more readily determinable). Must calculate gain/loss on A and establish ACB for B.

### 6.2 DeFi Lending

- **DeFi Lending** — Lending crypto to a DeFi protocol may be a disposition (if legal ownership transfers to the protocol). Conservative treatment: disposition at FMV when deposited, reacquisition when withdrawn. Interest/yield received is property income.

### 6.3 NFTs

- **NFTs** — Treated the same as other crypto assets. Acquisition = ACB. Sale = disposition. If creating NFTs as a business, profits are business income.

### 6.4 Wrapped Tokens

- **Wrapped Tokens** — Wrapping (e.g., ETH → WETH) is a grey area. Conservative treatment: disposition of ETH, acquisition of WETH at same FMV. No gain/loss but must track separately.

### 6.5 Emigration from Canada

- **Emigration from Canada** — Deemed disposition of all crypto at FMV on departure date. Capital gains tax applies on departure.  _(ITA s. 128.1)_

### 6.6 Death

- **Death** — Deemed disposition at FMV immediately before death. Capital gains included in terminal return. Beneficiary acquires at FMV as their ACB.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- **Prohibitions** — - NEVER apply a higher inclusion rate than 50% — the proposed 66.67% rate above $250K was cancelled March 21, 2025; 50% applies to all gains in 2025 - NEVER use specific identification method for identical properties -- CRA requires weighted average (ITA s. 47) - NEVER ignore the superficial loss rule for repurchases within 30 days - NEVER treat crypto-to-crypto swaps as non-events -- each swap is a disposition - NEVER claim business losses without substantiating that the activity is a business (not capital) - NEVER ignore GST/HST obligations for crypto businesses - NEVER assume airdrops are always tax-free -- determine if income character exists - NEVER omit staking/mining income -- it is taxable when received - NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
