## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Standard Bimonthly Return

**Input:** Standard-rated supplies R500,000 (VAT-exclusive). Purchases R200,000 (VAT-exclusive, all standard-rated, valid invoices).

**Reasoning:**
Output VAT: R500,000 x 15% = R75,000. Input VAT: R200,000 x 15% = R30,000. VAT payable: R75,000 - R30,000 = R45,000. VAT-inclusive supply total: R575,000 (Field 1). VAT-inclusive purchase total: R230,000.

**Classification:** VAT payable R45,000 (Field 20).

### Example 2 -- Exporter in Refund Position

**Input:** Zero-rated exports R800,000. Purchases R300,000 (standard-rated).

**Reasoning:**
Output VAT: R0. Input VAT: R300,000 x 15% = R45,000. Refund: R45,000.

**Classification:** VAT refund R45,000.

### Example 3 -- Second-Hand Goods Purchase

**Input:** Vendor buys used equipment from non-vendor for R50,000 (no VAT charged).

**Reasoning:**
Notional input tax: R50,000 x 15/115 = R6,521.74. Claimable if documentation requirements are met (declaration from seller, proof of payment). Reported in Field 15 (input VAT on other goods/services).

**Classification:** Input tax R6,521.74 (Field 15). Flag for reviewer on documentation.

### Example 4 -- Bad Debt Relief

**Input:** Invoice for R23,000 (incl. VAT) written off after 14 months.

**Reasoning:**
Bad debt relief under s 22(1): debt outstanding over 12 months and written off. Relief: R23,000 x 15/115 = R3,000.

**Classification:** Input tax deduction R3,000.

### Example 5 -- Google Ads (Imported Services)

**Input:** Google Ads spend R50,000 for the period. Google now bills via SA-registered entity with SA VAT number and issues VAT tax invoices.

**Reasoning:**
Where Google bills via a South African entity registered for VAT and issues a valid tax invoice showing 15% VAT, the vendor claims input tax directly. VAT amount: R50,000 x 15/115 = R6,521.74. Reported in Field 15 (input VAT on other goods/services). If billed by a non-resident entity without SA VAT registration, the vendor must self-account for output VAT under s 7(1)(c) in Field 12 (imported services) and claim corresponding input in Field 15 if the service is for making taxable supplies.

**Classification:** Input tax R6,521.74 (Field 15) where billed by SA entity. If imported service: output in Field 12, input in Field 15.
