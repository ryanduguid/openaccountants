## Section 4 -- Worked examples

### Example 1 -- Standard self-employed, mid-range

**Input:** Age 35, revenue R600,000, expenses R180,000, RA R80,000, medical R3,500/mo (main + 1 dependant), provisional paid R40,000.
**Computation:** Net profit R420,000. s11F = 27.5% x R420,000 = R115,500 (within R430,000 cap). Taxable = R304,500. Tax = R44,136 + 26% x R59,300 = R59,554. Less rebate R17,820. Less medical credit R9,024 (R376 x 2 x 12). Net = R32,710. Less provisional R40,000. Refund R7,290.

### Example 2 -- Turnover tax

**Input:** Non-professional sole proprietor, turnover R650,000.
**Computation:** R650,000 turnover falls within 2026/27 bracket R600,001--R950,000 at 1% above R600,000. Tax = 1% x R50,000 = R500.

### Example 3 -- Entertainment disallowed

**Input:** Client claims R15,000 client entertainment dinners. **Result:** Review under s 11(a) and s 23(g). If bona fide business development with evidence of business purpose, may be deductible. If no clear nexus to income production, disallow. s 23(m) does NOT apply to sole proprietors. VAT input on entertainment is separately blocked under s 17(2)(a) VAT Act.

### Example 4 -- Retirement cap exceeded

**Input:** Taxable income R2,000,000, RA R600,000.
**Computation:** 27.5% x R2,000,000 = R550,000 but cap R430,000. Deduction = R430,000. Excess R170,000 carries forward.
