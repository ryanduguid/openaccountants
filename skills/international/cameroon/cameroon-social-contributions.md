**CNPS branch overview (2025):**

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Old-age / invalidity / death pension (vieillesse-invalidité-décès) | 4.20% | 4.20% | XAF 750,000/mo [CLEISS] |
| Family allowances (prestations familiales), general regime | 0% | 7.00% | XAF 750,000/mo [CLEISS] |
| Occupational risks (risques professionnels) | 0% | 1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00% by risk class | full salary [CLEISS] |
| **CNPS totals (min risk 1.75%)** | **4.20%** | **12.95%** | mixed |
| **CNPS totals (max risk 5.00%)** | **4.20%** | **16.20%** | mixed |

*Arithmetic check (employer, min risk): 7.00 + 4.20 + 1.75 = 12.95%. (max risk): 7.00 + 4.20 + 5.00 = 16.20%.*

> Note: research notes cite an employer band of "~12.95%–15.20%". The 15.20% figure appears to combine 7% + 4.2% + 2.5% (mid risk) + 1.5% CFC, mixing CNPS and the housing fund. Computed CNPS-only employer totals are 12.95% (min), 13.70% (mid 2.50%), 16.20% (max 5.00%). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact employer band and how the 15.20% headline is composed.]

**Family-allowance rate variants** (replace the 7.00% general regime) [CLEISS]:

| Regime | Family-allowance employer rate |
|---|---|
| General | 7.00% |
| Agricultural workers | 5.65% |
| Private-education staff | 3.70% |

**Other mandatory payroll levies (not CNPS):**

| Levy | Employee | Employer | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Housing fund — Crédit Foncier du Cameroun (CFC) | 1.0% | 1.5% | PwC Other taxes |
| National Employment Fund (FNE) | 0% | 1.0% | PwC Other taxes |

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown risk class | Apply minimum 1.75% occupational-risk rate; flag for reviewer |
| Unknown regime (general vs agricultural vs education) | Assume general regime (7% family allowance) |
| Salary above ceiling, ceiling treatment unclear | Cap pension + family base at XAF 750,000/mo; apply risk on full salary [CLEISS] |
| Unknown whether worker is salaried | Treat as salaried; do not apply minimum-tax/turnover rules |
| Unknown CAC applicability | Apply the 10% CAC surcharge (effective rates) and flag |
| Ambiguous DGI vs CNPS debit | Classify per reference; if unclear, flag for reviewer |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- gross monthly taxable salary and whether the worker is salaried (employee) vs self-employed/voluntary insured. Without gross salary, STOP. Do not compute contributions.

**Recommended** -- the enterprise's CNPS occupational-risk classification (1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00%), the applicable family-allowance regime (general / agricultural / private-education), and the employee's CNPS registration status.

**Ideal** -- the employer's CNPS DIPE / récapitulatif, monthly DGI payroll returns, bank statements showing CNPS, DGI, CFC and FNE remittances, and residence/days-present information for any foreign national.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-CM-SOC-1 -- Gross salary unknown.** *Trigger:* gross monthly taxable salary not provided. *Message:* "Gross monthly taxable salary is mandatory. CNPS and PIT both depend on it (with a XAF 750,000/month ceiling on the pension and family branches). Cannot proceed without it."

**R-CM-SOC-2 -- Occupational-risk class unknown for a precise employer figure.** *Trigger:* a precise employer total is requested but the enterprise risk classification (1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00%) is unknown. *Message:* "Employer occupational-risk rate depends on the enterprise's CNPS risk classification. I will use the minimum 1.75% as a conservative default and flag it; the exact rate must be confirmed against the CNPS notification before filing."

**R-CM-SOC-3 -- Self-employed / voluntary insured.** *Trigger:* the person is a voluntary/self-insured contributor rather than a salaried employee. *Message:* "Voluntary insured persons contribute 8.40% of declared income to the pension branch [CLEISS], but declared-income rules and eligibility require CNPS confirmation. Escalate to a Cameroon-qualified accountant."

**R-CM-SOC-4 -- Penalty / arrears quantification.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid CNPS or PIT and asks for the arrears figure. *Message:* "Late payment carries a 10% penalty plus 1.5%/month interest (interest capped at 50% of principal) per secondary summaries [RESEARCH GAP — not verified against the CGI text]. Do not quantify arrears without official DGI/CNPS statements. Escalate to a Cameroon-qualified accountant."

**R-CM-SOC-5 -- Expatriate residence determination.** *Trigger:* a foreign national's tax status is in question. *Message:* "A foreign national present > 183 days in a calendar year is tax-domiciled in Cameroon and taxed on worldwide income [PwC]. Day counts and treaty relief must be confirmed by a qualified accountant before applying payroll taxes."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Cameroon payroll, social security, and tax. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the statement. CNPS, CFC, FNE, and PIT remittances are statutory obligations -- EXCLUDE them from any business revenue/expense or VAT (TVA) supply classification.

### 3.1 CNPS social security debits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNPS, CAISSE NATIONALE DE PREVOYANCE | EXCLUDE -- CNPS remittance | Monthly social contributions |
| PREVOYANCE SOCIALE, COTISATION CNPS | EXCLUDE -- CNPS remittance | Same |
| PENSION, VIEILLESSE, INVALIDITE | EXCLUDE -- CNPS pension branch | Pension contribution |
| PRESTATIONS FAMILIALES, ALLOCATIONS FAMILIALES | EXCLUDE -- CNPS family branch | Family allowances |
| RISQUES PROFESSIONNELS, ACCIDENT TRAVAIL | EXCLUDE -- CNPS risk branch | Occupational risk |

### 3.2 DGI / income-tax and PAYE debits (NOT CNPS)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| DGI, IMPOTS, DIRECTION GENERALE DES IMPOTS | EXCLUDE -- tax remittance, not CNPS | PIT/IRPP and other taxes |
| IRPP, IR SALAIRES, PRECOMPTE | EXCLUDE -- PIT withholding | PAYE on salaries |
| TVA, TAXE VALEUR AJOUTEE | EXCLUDE -- VAT remittance | Not a contribution |
| CAC, CENTIMES ADDITIONNELS | EXCLUDE -- council surcharge on PIT | Part of PIT effective rate |

### 3.3 Other mandatory payroll levies

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CFC, CREDIT FONCIER | EXCLUDE -- housing fund levy | 1% employee / 1.5% employer |
| FNE, FONDS NATIONAL EMPLOI | EXCLUDE -- employment fund levy | 1% employer |
| TAXE COMMUNALE, TAXE DEVELOPPEMENT LOCAL | EXCLUDE -- local council tax | Banded, up to XAF 2,520/mo |
| RAV, REDEVANCE AUDIOVISUELLE, CRTV | EXCLUDE -- audiovisual royalty | Banded, max XAF 13,000 |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALAIRE, PAIE, VIREMENT SALAIRE (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net pay to employee; not a contribution |
| SALAIRE, PAIE (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not a contribution |

### 3.5 Benefits received (not contributions)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Bank statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Cameroonian employer (general regime, minimum 1.75% risk class) and its salaried staff. All figures in XAF.

### Example 1 -- Employee earning below the ceiling (XAF 300,000/mo)

**Input line:**
`15.02.2025 ; CNPS COTISATION JANVIER ; DEBIT ; PENSION SALARIE ; -12 600 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Salary XAF 300,000 < XAF 750,000 ceiling, so the full salary is the pension/family base. Employee pension = 300,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 12,600**. The debit matches "CNPS COTISATION" (pattern 3.1). This is the employee pension share withheld and remitted.

Employer side (same month, same employee):
- Pension 4.20% × 300,000 = 12,600
- Family 7.00% × 300,000 = 21,000
- Risk 1.75% × 300,000 = 5,250
- CNPS employer subtotal = **XAF 38,850** (= 12.95% × 300,000) ✓
- CFC employer 1.5% × 300,000 = 4,500; FNE 1.0% × 300,000 = 3,000
- CFC employee 1.0% × 300,000 = 3,000

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT/revenue -- CNPS statutory remittance.

### Example 2 -- Employee above the ceiling (XAF 1,200,000/mo)

**Input line:**
`15.04.2025 ; CNPS PREVOYANCE SOCIALE ; DEBIT ; PENSION PLAFONNE ; -31 500 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Salary XAF 1,200,000 > XAF 750,000 ceiling. Pension and family branches are capped at the ceiling; the occupational-risk branch uses the full salary (no ceiling) [CLEISS].
- Employee pension = 750,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 31,500** (capped). ✓ matches the debit.
- Employer pension = 750,000 × 4.20% = 31,500
- Employer family = 750,000 × 7.00% = 52,500
- Employer risk = 1,200,000 × 1.75% = 21,000 (full salary)
- CNPS employer subtotal = 31,500 + 52,500 + 21,000 = **XAF 105,000**

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- CNPS remittance (ceiling applied to pension/family, full salary for risk).

### Example 3 -- PIT (IRPP) withholding, not CNPS

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; DGI IMPOTS IRPP SALAIRES ; DEBIT ; PRECOMPTE FEVRIER ; -45 000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "DGI IMPOTS IRPP" (pattern 3.2). This is PIT withheld on salaries (PAYE), remitted to the DGI -- NOT a CNPS contribution. Exclude from VAT/revenue. Do not classify as social security.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- PIT (IRPP) remittance to DGI. NOT CNPS.

### Example 4 -- CFC housing-fund and FNE levies

**Input line:**
`15.05.2025 ; CREDIT FONCIER CFC + FNE ; DEBIT ; AVRIL 2025 ; -9 000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CREDIT FONCIER CFC" and "FNE" (pattern 3.3). For an employee on XAF 300,000:
- CFC employer 1.5% × 300,000 = 4,500
- FNE employer 1.0% × 300,000 = 3,000
- (CFC employee 1.0% × 300,000 = 3,000 is withheld separately, not in this XAF 9,000 employer remittance: 4,500 + 3,000 = 7,500; with the employee CFC 1,500 share rounding, see note.)

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether CFC employee and employer shares are remitted together or separately on local returns; example amounts illustrate rate application only.]

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- statutory payroll levies (housing fund + employment fund).

### Example 5 -- PIT computation on a XAF 500,000/mo salary (annualised)

**Reasoning (PIT base, per MINFI/PwC standard payroll computation):**
Gross annual salary = 500,000 × 12 = XAF 6,000,000.
- Less 4.20% CNPS employee (pension) deductible. Pension base capped at 750,000/mo > 500,000, so full salary: 6,000,000 × 4.20% = 252,000.
- Less 30% professional-expense abatement on salary [PwC]: 6,000,000 × 30% = 1,800,000.
- Less standard deduction XAF 500,000 [MINFI].

Net taxable income = 6,000,000 − 252,000 − 1,800,000 − 500,000 = **XAF 3,448,000**, rounded down to nearest thousand = XAF 3,448,000.

Apply base scale (10/15/25/35):
- 0 – 2,000,000 @ 10% = 200,000
- 2,000,001 – 3,000,000 @ 15% = 150,000 (cumulative 350,000)
- 3,000,001 – 3,448,000 @ 25% = 448,000 × 25% = 112,000

Base PIT = 200,000 + 150,000 + 112,000 = **XAF 462,000**.
With 10% CAC surcharge: 462,000 × 1.10 = **XAF 508,200** annual PIT (effective).

*Cross-check via effective rates (11/16.5/27.5): 2,000,000×11% = 220,000; 1,000,000×16.5% = 165,000; 448,000×27.5% = 123,200; total = 508,200. ✓*

**Classification:** Computation only -- PIT withheld monthly and remitted to DGI by the 15th of the following month.

### Example 6 -- Salary below the PIT exemption threshold

**Input line:**
`28.02.2025 ; VIREMENT SALAIRE ; DEBIT ; PAIE FEVRIER ; -55 000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Gross salary XAF 55,000/month < XAF 62,000/month exemption threshold [MINFI], so no PIT is deducted at source. CNPS pension (4.20% × 55,000 = XAF 2,310 employee) and employer branches still apply -- the exemption is PIT-only, not a contribution exemption. Note XAF 55,000 is below the XAF 60,000 SMIG; flag the underpayment for reviewer.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- net salary payment. No PIT; CNPS still due. Flag sub-SMIG wage.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when data is clear and inputs are available.

### Rule 1 -- CNPS employee contribution

```
Employee CNPS = min(gross_salary, 750,000) × 4.20%   [pension branch only]
```
Employees contribute to the pension branch only; family allowances and occupational risks are employer-borne [CLEISS].

### Rule 2 -- CNPS employer contribution

```
Employer CNPS = min(gross, 750,000) × 4.20%   (pension)
              + min(gross, 750,000) × FAM%     (family: 7.00% general / 5.65% agric / 3.70% educ)
              + gross × RISK%                   (risk: 1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00%, no ceiling)
```
General-regime minimum-risk employer total = 12.95% (mixed base) [CLEISS; PwC].

### Rule 3 -- The XAF 750,000/month ceiling

Pension and family branches are capped at XAF 750,000/month (XAF 9,000,000/year). The occupational-risk branch is assessed on the full salary with no ceiling [CLEISS].

### Rule 4 -- CFC and FNE levies

CFC (housing fund): employee 1.0% + employer 1.5% of taxable salary. FNE (employment fund): employer 1.0% of taxable salary [PwC Other taxes]. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the CFC/FNE base is itself capped; PwC states "taxable salary" without a stated cap.]

### Rule 5 -- PIT scale (base vs effective)

Base statutory scale (MINFI): 10% / 15% / 25% / 35%. PwC effective rates include the 10% CAC surcharge: 11% / 16.5% / 27.5% / 38.5% (base × 1.10).

| Net income (XAF) | Base rate | Effective (incl. CAC) | Cumulative base tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,000,000 | 10% | 11% | 200,000 |
| 2,000,001 – 3,000,000 | 15% | 16.5% | 350,000 |
| 3,000,001 – 5,000,000 | 25% | 27.5% | 850,000 |
| Over 5,000,000 | 35% | 38.5% | — |

*Cumulative check: 2,000,000×10% = 200,000; +1,000,000×15% = 150,000 → 350,000; +2,000,000×25% = 500,000 → 850,000. ✓*

### Rule 6 -- PIT taxable base

Net salary base = gross − 4.20% CNPS employee − 30% professional-expense abatement − XAF 500,000 standard deduction; round down to the nearest XAF 1,000 [MINFI; PwC].

### Rule 7 -- PIT exemption floor

Only salaries ≥ XAF 62,000/month are subject to PIT deduction at source; below this, exempt from PIT (not from CNPS) [MINFI].

### Rule 8 -- Local payroll levies

Local development tax (taxe communale): up to XAF 2,520/month, banded, on salaries exceeding XAF 500,000 [PwC]. Audiovisual royalty (RAV/CRTV): banded, maximum XAF 13,000, for gross salaries above XAF 1,000,000 [PwC].

### Rule 9 -- Monthly remittance

PIT and CNPS for a salary month are remitted (and the monthly return filed) by the 15th of the following month [MINFI; PwC].

### Rule 10 -- Registration

Employers must register with CNPS and obtain an employer number; employees are registered as *assurés obligatoires*. Registration is mandatory from the first employee — no de-minimis headcount threshold found [CNPS]. [RESEARCH GAP — no numeric registration threshold confirmed.]

### Rule 11 -- Voluntary insured persons

Voluntary/self-insured contributors pay 8.40% of declared income to the pension branch [CLEISS]. This is outside standard salaried payroll — see Refusal R-CM-SOC-3.

### Rule 12 -- Non-salary income rates

Income from stocks and shares is taxed at an overall 16.5%; other (non-salary) activity income at 33% [PwC]. These are out of scope for the salaried-payroll path but noted for classification.

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

Flag these for reviewer confirmation when data is ambiguous.

### T2-1 -- Occupational-risk classification

**Trigger:** the enterprise risk rate (1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00%) is not on file.
**Issue:** employer total swings materially with the risk class.
**Action:** apply 1.75% as a conservative default; flag for reviewer to confirm against the CNPS notification.

### T2-2 -- Special family-allowance regime

**Trigger:** employer is agricultural or a private-education establishment.
**Issue:** family-allowance rate is 5.65% (agric) or 3.70% (educ), not 7% [CLEISS].
**Action:** flag; confirm the regime before computing employer cost.

### T2-3 -- CAC surcharge applicability

**Trigger:** uncertainty whether the 10% CAC applies to a given PIT computation.
**Issue:** the CAC mechanism is reconciled from MINFI base rates vs PwC effective rates, not stated verbatim on a single official page [RESEARCH GAP].
**Action:** apply the effective (11/16.5/27.5/38.5) rates by default; flag for reviewer to confirm CAC treatment.

### T2-4 -- Expatriate / 183-day residence

**Trigger:** a foreign national whose day count is near 183.
**Issue:** > 183 days → tax-domiciled, worldwide-income taxation [PwC].
**Action:** flag; confirm residence and treaty relief with a qualified accountant.

### T2-5 -- Salary above the ceiling

**Trigger:** salary > XAF 750,000/month.
**Issue:** pension/family capped at the ceiling; risk on full salary. Some EOR guides incorrectly cap all branches [RESEARCH GAP — CLEISS treated as authoritative].
**Action:** apply CLEISS treatment (full salary for risk); flag if a source disagrees.

### T2-6 -- Arrears / penalties

**Trigger:** unpaid CNPS or PIT.
**Issue:** 10% penalty + 1.5%/month interest (capped at 50% of principal); filing penalties 10%/month capped at 30%; understatement 30%/100%/150% [secondary sources only — RESEARCH GAP].
**Action:** do not quantify without official statements. Escalate to a qualified accountant.

### T2-7 -- Sub-SMIG wages

**Trigger:** gross salary < XAF 60,000/month (non-agricultural).
**Issue:** below the headline SMIG [CLEISS; widely cited].
**Action:** flag the underpayment; confirm the current decree (SMIG confirmed to 2023, cited as current — [RESEARCH GAP]).

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How payroll debits appear on Cameroonian bank statements

Common banks: Afriland First Bank, SGBC (Société Générale Cameroun), BICEC, Ecobank Cameroun, UBA Cameroun, Commercial Bank of Cameroon.

**CNPS remittances:**
- Description: "CNPS", "CAISSE NATIONALE DE PREVOYANCE", "COTISATION CNPS", "PREVOYANCE SOCIALE"
- Timing: monthly, around or before the 15th of the following month
- Amount: employee 4.20% (pension) + employer branches; large employers remit a consolidated figure

**DGI / tax remittances:**
- Description: "DGI", "IMPOTS", "IRPP", "PRECOMPTE", "TVA"
- Timing: monthly, by the 15th
- These are tax, NOT CNPS — do not classify as social security

**CFC / FNE levies:**
- Description: "CREDIT FONCIER", "CFC", "FNE", "FONDS NATIONAL EMPLOI"

**Key identification tips:**
1. CNPS/DGI/CFC/FNE debits are outgoing (DEBIT), never credits.
2. They recur monthly with amounts proportional to the payroll.
3. Do not confuse CNPS (social security) with DGI/IRPP (income tax) — both are statutory but separate.
4. Inbound CNPS credits are benefits received (pension, family allowance), not contributions paid.
5. Amounts are in XAF (FCFA); no decimal sub-unit is used in practice.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for CNPS debits** — identify outgoing payments matching Section 3.1.
2. **Separate CNPS from DGI/CFC/FNE** — use the reference text per Sections 3.2–3.3.
3. **Reverse-engineer the salary base where possible:**
   - Employee pension debit ÷ 4.20% ≈ capped salary base (max XAF 750,000).
   - If the implied base hits XAF 750,000 exactly, salary is at or above the ceiling.
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution classification derived from bank statement amounts only. Risk class, family regime, and residence status have not been verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing CNPS/DGI returns."

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### Contribution summary (2025, general regime)

| Item | Employee | Employer (min risk) | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension | 4.20% | 4.20% | min(gross, 750,000) | CLEISS |
| Family allowances | 0% | 7.00% | min(gross, 750,000) | CLEISS |
| Occupational risks | 0% | 1.75% / 2.50% / 5.00% | full gross | CLEISS |
| CFC (housing) | 1.00% | 1.50% | taxable salary | PwC |
| FNE (employment) | 0% | 1.00% | taxable salary | PwC |
| **Social total (min risk)** | **5.20%** | **15.45%** | mixed | computed |

*Arithmetic check: employee 4.20 + 1.00 (CFC) = 5.20%. Employer 4.20 + 7.00 + 1.75 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 15.45%.* ✓

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Salary XAF 300,000/mo, general regime, min risk. → Employee pension 300,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 12,600**. Employer CNPS 300,000 × 12.95% = **XAF 38,850**.

**Test 2:** Salary XAF 750,000/mo (exactly the ceiling), min risk. → Employee pension 750,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 31,500**. Employer CNPS = 750,000 × 12.95% = **XAF 97,125** (all branches on 750,000 since risk base = full salary = ceiling here).

**Test 3:** Salary XAF 1,200,000/mo, min risk. → Employee pension capped: 750,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 31,500**. Employer = pension 31,500 + family 52,500 + risk (1,200,000 × 1.75% = 21,000) = **XAF 105,000**.

**Test 4:** Salary XAF 55,000/mo. → Below XAF 62,000 PIT floor → **no PIT**. CNPS pension employee 55,000 × 4.20% = **XAF 2,310** still due. Below SMIG — flag.

**Test 5:** Annual salary XAF 6,000,000 PIT base. → Net taxable = 6,000,000 − 252,000 − 1,800,000 − 500,000 = **XAF 3,448,000**. Base PIT = 200,000 + 150,000 + (448,000 × 25% = 112,000) = **XAF 462,000**. Effective (incl. CAC) = **XAF 508,200**.

**Test 6:** Net taxable income XAF 5,000,000 (top of 25% band). → Base PIT = 850,000. Effective = 850,000 × 1.10 = **XAF 935,000**.

**Test 7:** Net taxable income XAF 8,000,000. → Base = 850,000 + (3,000,000 × 35% = 1,050,000) = **XAF 1,900,000**. Effective = 1,900,000 × 1.10 = **XAF 2,090,000**.

**Test 8:** Agricultural employer, salary XAF 400,000/mo, min risk. → Employer = pension 16,800 + family (400,000 × 5.65% = 22,600) + risk (400,000 × 1.75% = 7,000) = **XAF 46,400**.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER compute contributions without the gross monthly salary.
- NEVER apply the XAF 750,000 ceiling to the occupational-risk branch — risk is on full salary [CLEISS].
- NEVER omit the employer family-allowance branch (7% general) — it is the largest single employer cost.
- NEVER conflate CNPS (social security) with DGI/IRPP (income tax) — separate obligations, separate authorities.
- NEVER apply PIT below the XAF 62,000/month floor; but NEVER treat that floor as a CNPS exemption.
- NEVER quote penalty figures as definitive — they are unverified secondary sources [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER assume the 7% family rate for agricultural or private-education employers.
- NEVER present contribution or PIT figures as definitive — label as estimated and direct the client to official CNPS/DGI statements.
- NEVER quantify arrears or penalties without official statements — escalate to a Cameroon-qualified accountant.
- NEVER assume a foreign national is non-resident without confirming the 183-day count.
