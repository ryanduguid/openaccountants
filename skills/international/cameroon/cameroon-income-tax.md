### IRPP Rate Brackets (2025) -- CAC-inclusive scale

Progressive scale applied to **overall annual net taxable income, rounded down to the nearest XAF 1,000**. The headline rates below already include the 10% CAC surcharge (statutory base scale 10/15/25/35% + 10% CAC = 11/16.5/27.5/38.5%). [PwC -- https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/taxes-on-personal-income]

| Net taxable income band (XAF / year) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,000,000 | 11% | XAF 220,000 |
| 2,000,001 -- 3,000,000 | 16.5% | XAF 385,000 |
| 3,000,001 -- 5,000,000 | 27.5% | XAF 935,000 |
| Over 5,000,000 | 38.5% | -- |

**Cumulative check:** 2,000,000 x 11% = 220,000; + 1,000,000 x 16.5% = 165,000 -> 385,000; + 2,000,000 x 27.5% = 550,000 -> 935,000. Above 5,000,000, tax = 935,000 + 38.5% of the excess over 5,000,000.

### Schedular / special rates

| Income type | Overall rate (CAC-inclusive) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Income from stocks/shares (dividends, investment income) | 16.5% (15% + CAC) | [PwC -- taxes-on-personal-income] |
| Other non-commercial / business / professional net profits (actual-earnings regime) | 33% (30% + CAC) | [PwC -- taxes-on-personal-income] |
| Minimum tax (turnover-based, non-salaried, regime-dependent) | 2.2% or 5.5% of turnover | [PwC -- taxes-on-personal-income] |

**Minimum tax does NOT apply to salaried workers or taxpayers under the IGS/discharge system.** [PwC]

### Salary income determination

- **Residents** (fiscal domicile in Cameroon) are taxed on **worldwide income**. [PwC -- income-determination]
- **Net salary base** = gross salary, **less a standard 30% lump-sum deduction** for professional expenses, **less mandatory social contributions** (CNPS employee portion). [PwC -- income-determination]
- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the exact mechanics, ordering, and any cap on the 30% professional-expense deduction against the current General Tax Code; the 30% figure is the standard PwC-reported figure but the statutory wording/cap was not transcribed.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown taxpayer type (salaried vs self-employed) | STOP -- do not apply a scale without knowing income type |
| Unknown residency | Treat as resident (worldwide income) only after confirmation; otherwise STOP |
| Unknown turnover (self-employed regime) | STOP -- IGS vs actual-earnings turns on turnover |
| Unknown CNPS occupational-risk class | Use lowest published rate 1.75% and flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether expense is professional | Not deductible (rely on the 30% lump sum only) |
| Unknown CGA membership (self-employed) | Assume NOT a CGA member (no IGS halving) |
| Unknown VAT status | Standard 19.25% VAT-registered |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- for a salaried client: gross annual (or monthly) salary, residency status, and CNPS contribution records. For a self-employed client: full-year bank statement (CSV, PDF, or pasted text) plus annual VAT-exclusive turnover and chosen tax regime.

**Recommended** -- monthly payslips, employer DIPE/recapitulative summary, CNPS statements, prior-year annual declaration, VAT registration evidence, CGA membership certificate (if self-employed).

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, evidence of council tax / CRTV withholding, Credit Foncier and FNE deduction records, provisional/instalment payment confirmations.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No salary figure or no bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without supporting documents = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all figures are supported by valid documentation and that the regime (IGS vs actual-earnings) is correctly determined."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-CM-1 -- Income type / regime unknown.** "Cameroon IRPP applies different scales to salary, investment income, and business profit, and different regimes (IGS vs actual-earnings) to the self-employed. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the income type and, for the self-employed, the annual turnover. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-CM-2 -- Companies and partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals (salaried and sole-trader/self-employed) only. Companies pay corporate income tax (IS) and file separately. Escalate to a Cameroon-qualified practitioner."

**R-CM-3 -- Non-resident / expatriate withholding.** "Non-resident and expatriate taxation (withholding on Cameroon-source income, treaty relief) has different rules and is out of scope. Escalate to a Cameroon-qualified practitioner."

**R-CM-4 -- Capital gains / property disposals.** "Capital gains and property-transfer taxation require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate."

**R-CM-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to DGI enforcement. Penalties (10%/month late filing, 1.5%/month interest, and 30%-100%/150% bad-faith assessment uplifts) are severe. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-CM-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers IRPP only. Cameroon standard VAT is 19.25% (17.5% + 10% CAC) and is computed separately. [PwC overview]"

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Cameroon statements are predominantly in **French**; match by case-insensitive substring on the libelle (description) or counterparty. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Credit on Bank Statement)

| Pattern (FR/EN) | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VIREMENT RECU, PAIEMENT CLIENT, REGLEMENT FACTURE | Business turnover | If VAT-registered, extract VAT-exclusive amount (gross / 1.1925) |
| HONORAIRES, PRESTATION, CONSULTATION | Business turnover | Professional fees -- typical self-employed |
| SALAIRE, PAIE, VIREMENT SALAIRE, EMPLOYEUR [name] | Salary income | Goes to salary IRPP computation, NOT business turnover |
| ORANGE MONEY, MTN MOMO, MOBILE MONEY (received) | Business turnover (if business) | Confirm business vs personal mobile-money inflow |
| STRIPE, PAYPAL, WISE PAYOUT | Business turnover | Platform payout -- match to invoices; VAT-exclusive if registered |
| LOYER RECU, REVENU LOCATIF | Rental income | Separate category -- not business turnover |
| DIVIDENDE, INTERETS, COUPON | Investment income | Taxed at flat 16.5% schedular rate (see Section 1) |
| REMBOURSEMENT IMPOT, RISTOURNE DGI | EXCLUDE | Tax refund -- not income |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits / Debit) -- Deductible for actual-earnings business

| Pattern (FR/EN) | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| LOYER BUREAU, LOYER COMMERCIAL | Office rent | Deductible | Dedicated business premises |
| ASSURANCE PRO, RESPONSABILITE CIVILE | Professional insurance | Deductible | |
| EXPERT-COMPTABLE, COMPTABLE, HONORAIRES COMPTABLES | Accountancy fees | Deductible | |
| AVOCAT, NOTAIRE, FRAIS JURIDIQUES | Legal fees | Deductible | Must be business-related |
| FOURNITURES BUREAU, PAPETERIE | Office supplies | Deductible | |
| PUBLICITE, MARKETING, GOOGLE ADS, META ADS | Marketing/advertising | Deductible | |
| FORMATION, SEMINAIRE, CONFERENCE | Training | Deductible | Must relate to current business |
| FRAIS BANCAIRES, COMMISSION BANCAIRE, AGIOS | Bank charges | Deductible | Business account only |
| ABONNEMENT, LOGICIEL, SAAS, MICROSOFT 365, ADOBE | Software subscription | Deductible | Recurring = operating expense |
| ELECTRICITE, ENEO, EAU, CAMWATER | Utilities | Deductible (business %) | Apportion if home/mixed use -- default 0% if mixed |
| ORANGE, MTN, CAMTEL (telecom) | Telecoms | Deductible (business %) | Business portion only |

**Note:** these deductions apply ONLY to self-employed taxpayers under the **actual-earnings (regime du reel)** regime. Salaried taxpayers rely on the standard 30% lump-sum professional-expense deduction; IGS taxpayers pay a synthetic tax on turnover and do not itemise. [PwC income-determination; openhubdigital 2025 Finance Law]

### 3.3 Expense Patterns (Debits) -- NOT Deductible

| Pattern (FR/EN) | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RESTAURANT, REPAS, RECEPTION, CADEAU CLIENT | Entertainment/gifts | NOT deductible | Treat as blocked; flag for reviewer |
| PERSONNEL, COURSES, SUPERMARCHE, MARCHE | Personal expenses | NOT deductible | Private living costs |
| AMENDE, PENALITE, CONTRAVENTION | Fines/penalties | NOT deductible | Public policy |
| IMPOT, IRPP, PAIEMENT DGI | Tax payments | NOT deductible | Income tax cannot reduce income |
| PRELEVEMENT PERSONNEL, RETRAIT ESPECES (personnel) | Drawings | NOT deductible | Not an expense |

### 3.4 Statutory Withholdings / Contributions (special handling)

| Pattern (FR/EN) | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNPS, COTISATION SOCIALE, PREVOYANCE SOCIALE | Social contribution | Employee portion reduces salary IRPP base (Section 3 social table) |
| CREDIT FONCIER, CFC | Housing fund | Employee 1% / employer 1.5% (Section 4) |
| FNE, FONDS NATIONAL EMPLOI | Employment fund | Employer 1% only |
| TAXE COMMUNALE, REDEVANCE COMMUNALE | Council tax (poll) | Flat band -- up to XAF 2,520/mo (Section 2 other-taxes) |
| RAV, REDEVANCE CRTV, AUDIOVISUEL | CRTV royalty | Up to XAF 13,000 graduated (Section 2 other-taxes) |
| TVA, PAIEMENT TVA | EXCLUDE | VAT liability payment, not an expense |

### 3.5 Exclusions (Neither Income nor Expense)

| Pattern (FR/EN) | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VIREMENT INTERNE, COMPTE PROPRE | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| REMBOURSEMENT PRET, ECHEANCE CREDIT (principal) | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |

### 3.6 Cameroon Banks / Channels -- Statement Format Reference

| Channel | Common Patterns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Afriland First Bank | VIREMENT, RETRAIT, COMMISSION, AGIOS | PDF; French libelle; date DD/MM/YYYY |
| SGC (Societe Generale Cameroun) | VIR, PRLV, CB, FRAIS | PDF/CSV; counterparty in libelle |
| BICEC | VIREMENT, PRELEVEMENT, COMMISSION | PDF; shorter descriptions |
| Ecobank Cameroun | TRANSFER, PAYMENT, CHARGES | PDF/CSV; mixed FR/EN |
| Orange Money / MTN MoMo | TRANSFERT, PAIEMENT MARCHAND, RETRAIT | Mobile-money statement export; confirm business vs personal |

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All examples use XAF. Salary IRPP base = gross - 30% professional deduction - CNPS employee 4.2% (capped), then rounded down to nearest XAF 1,000, then the progressive scale in Section 1 (220,000 / 385,000 / 935,000 cumulative checkpoints).

### Example 1 -- Salaried employee, mid-range salary

**Input:** Resident employee, gross annual salary XAF 6,000,000. No other income.

**Reasoning:**
- 30% professional deduction: 6,000,000 x 30% = 1,800,000.
- CNPS employee pension 4.2%; annual salary 6,000,000 is below the XAF 9,000,000 ceiling, so 4.2% x 6,000,000 = 252,000.
- Net taxable = 6,000,000 - 1,800,000 - 252,000 = 3,948,000 (already a multiple of 1,000).
- IRPP: first 2,000,000 -> 220,000; next 1,000,000 -> 165,000 (cumulative 385,000); remaining 948,000 @ 27.5% = 260,700.
- **Total IRPP = 385,000 + 260,700 = 645,700.**

**Classification:** Annual IRPP = XAF 645,700 (before council tax / CRTV / housing-fund withholdings).

### Example 2 -- Salaried employee above the CNPS ceiling

**Input:** Resident employee, gross annual salary XAF 12,000,000.

**Reasoning:**
- 30% professional deduction: 12,000,000 x 30% = 3,600,000.
- CNPS employee pension is capped at XAF 9,000,000/year base: 4.2% x 9,000,000 = 378,000 (NOT 4.2% x 12,000,000).
- Net taxable = 12,000,000 - 3,600,000 - 378,000 = 8,022,000.
- IRPP: cumulative to 5,000,000 = 935,000; excess = 8,022,000 - 5,000,000 = 3,022,000 @ 38.5% = 1,163,470.
- **Total IRPP = 935,000 + 1,163,470 = 2,098,470.**

**Classification:** Annual IRPP = XAF 2,098,470. Council tax band XAF 2,520/mo and CRTV up to XAF 13,000 apply separately.

### Example 3 -- Dividend / investment income (schedular flat rate)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; AFRILAND VIREMENT RECU ; DIVIDENDE SARL XYZ ; +5,000,000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Investment income from shares is taxed at the flat schedular overall rate of **16.5%** (15% + CAC), not the progressive salary scale. 5,000,000 x 16.5% = 825,000.

**Classification:** Investment-income IRPP = XAF 825,000 (flat). Do NOT run through the progressive scale.

### Example 4 -- Self-employed under IGS, CGA member

**Input:** Self-employed (salon), annual VAT-exclusive turnover XAF 12,000,000. Member of an approved Centre de Gestion Agree (CGA).

**Reasoning:**
- Turnover XAF 12,000,000 is below XAF 50,000,000, so the taxpayer falls under the **IGS (Impot General Synthetique)** synthetic regime, not actual-earnings. [openhubdigital 2025 Finance Law]
- Worked figure from the authority example: turnover XAF 12,000,000 -> IGS XAF 500,000; as a CGA member the rate is **halved** to **XAF 250,000**. [cga.inov.cm IGS 2025 example]
- IGS is declared and paid **quarterly within 15 days of each quarter-end**.
- **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the full IGS rate/band table (published only as an image in the secondary source) against the 2025 Code General des Impots (impots.cm/en/node/1212) or the 2025 Finance Law circular.

**Classification:** Annual IGS = XAF 250,000 (CGA-reduced), paid quarterly. Minimum tax does not apply under IGS.

### Example 5 -- SaaS subscription (deductible, actual-earnings)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2025 ; SGC PRLV ; MICROSOFT 365 ; ABONNEMENT AVRIL ; -15,000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Recurring software subscription, wholly for the business. Deductible operating expense for a self-employed taxpayer under the **actual-earnings** regime. If VAT-registered, deduct the VAT-exclusive amount (15,000 / 1.1925 = 12,579) and recover the input VAT separately.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense = XAF 15,000 (or VAT-exclusive XAF 12,579 if registered). Not relevant to IGS or salaried taxpayers.

### Example 6 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BICEC VIREMENT ; COMPTE PROPRE EPARGNE ; ; -2,000,000 ; XAF`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency and Scope

Residents (fiscal domicile in Cameroon) are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents are out of scope for this skill (R-CM-3). [PwC -- income-determination]

### 5.2 Salary IRPP Base

Net taxable salary = gross salary - 30% lump-sum professional-expense deduction - mandatory CNPS employee contributions, rounded down to the nearest XAF 1,000, then the progressive scale in Section 1. [PwC -- income-determination; taxes-on-personal-income]
**[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the exact statutory mechanics and any cap on the 30% deduction.

### 5.3 Progressive Scale (CAC-inclusive)

Apply 11% / 16.5% / 27.5% / 38.5% per Section 1. The rates already include the 10% CAC surcharge. [PwC]

### 5.4 Schedular Income

| Income type | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Salary | Progressive scale (Section 1) |
| Dividends / investment income from shares | Flat 16.5% (15% + CAC) [PwC] |
| Non-commercial / business / professional profit (actual-earnings) | Flat 33% (30% + CAC) [PwC] |

### 5.5 Minimum Tax

For non-salaried taxpayers under actual-earnings, minimum tax is **2.2% or 5.5% of turnover** depending on the applicable regime. It does NOT apply to salaried workers or IGS taxpayers. [PwC]

### 5.6 Social Security -- CNPS (Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance Sociale)

Monthly contribution ceiling for the pension branch: **XAF 750,000/month (XAF 9,000,000/year)**, raised from XAF 300,000 by Presidential Decree. [PwC -- other-taxes; CNPS]

| Branch | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| Old-age / invalidity / death pension | 4.2% (capped at XAF 750,000/mo) | 4.2% (capped at XAF 750,000/mo) |
| Family allowances (general regime) | 0% | 7% (capped at XAF 750,000/mo) -- agricultural 5.65%, private teachers 3.7% |
| Occupational accidents / risk (class A/B/C) | 0% | 1.75% - 5% by industry risk class (uncapped on gross) |
| **TOTAL CNPS (general regime, lowest risk class)** | **4.2%** | **12.95%** (4.2% + 7% + 1.75%) |
| **TOTAL CNPS (general regime, highest risk class)** | **4.2%** | **16.2%** (4.2% + 7% + 5%) |
| Voluntary insurance (self-employed / optional pension) | 8.4% of declared income | n/a |

**Employer total check:** lowest class 4.2 + 7 + 1.75 = 12.95%; highest class 4.2 + 7 + 5 = 16.2%. Employee total = 4.2% (pension only).
Sources: employee 4.2% / ceiling XAF 750,000 [PwC -- other-taxes]; employer pension 4.2%, family 7%, occupational 1.75-5% [Rivermate -- rivermate.com/guides/cameroon/taxes]; equal employer/employee pension split [CNPS -- cnps.cm].
**[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the exact per-branch employer split and occupational-risk class rates against CNPS regulatory texts (cnps.cm/en/medias/textes-reglementaires1.html); secondary sources are consistent but CNPS did not publish per-branch percentages directly.

### 5.7 Housing Fund and Employment Fund

| Fund | Employee | Employer | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Credit Foncier du Cameroun (CFC, housing) | 1% | 1.5% | [PwC -- other-taxes] |

Both are computed on taxable salary.

### 5.8 Other Individual Withholdings

| Levy | Amount | Source |

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Salaried mid-range.**
Input: Resident, gross salary XAF 6,000,000, no other income.
Expected: 30% deduction 1,800,000; CNPS 252,000; net 3,948,000; IRPP = 385,000 + 948,000 x 27.5% (260,700) = **XAF 645,700**.

**Test 2 -- Salaried above CNPS ceiling.**
Input: Resident, gross salary XAF 12,000,000.
Expected: 30% deduction 3,600,000; CNPS capped 9,000,000 x 4.2% = 378,000; net 8,022,000; IRPP = 935,000 + 3,022,000 x 38.5% (1,163,470) = **XAF 2,098,470**.

**Test 3 -- Investment income flat rate.**
Input: Dividend income XAF 5,000,000.
Expected: 5,000,000 x 16.5% = **XAF 825,000**. NOT run through the progressive scale.

**Test 4 -- IGS, CGA member.**
Input: Self-employed salon, turnover XAF 12,000,000, CGA member.
Expected: IGS XAF 500,000 halved to **XAF 250,000** (paid quarterly). [RESEARCH GAP on full band table.]

**Test 5 -- Bracket boundary.**
Input: Net taxable income exactly XAF 5,000,000.
Expected: cumulative tax = **XAF 935,000** (220,000 + 165,000 + 550,000); no 38.5% applies at the boundary.

**Test 6 -- Lowest band.**
Input: Net taxable income XAF 1,500,000.
Expected: 1,500,000 x 11% = **XAF 165,000**.

**Test 7 -- Employer CNPS total (lowest risk).**
Input: Monthly salary at/below ceiling, lowest occupational-risk class.
Expected: employer total = 4.2% + 7% + 1.75% = **12.95%**; employee total = **4.2%**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the progressive salary scale to investment income (use flat 16.5%) or to IGS turnover
- NEVER compute final tax figures as definitive -- always label as estimated and pass to the deterministic engine
- NEVER apply CNPS 4.2% on a base above the XAF 9,000,000/year ceiling
- NEVER add the 10% CAC again on top of the 11/16.5/27.5/38.5% scale -- it is already included
- NEVER apply minimum tax to salaried workers or IGS taxpayers
- NEVER itemise business expenses for a salaried taxpayer -- only the 30% lump-sum deduction applies
- NEVER halve IGS without a verified CGA membership certificate
- NEVER treat a non-resident as worldwide-taxed without confirming residency (escalate per R-CM-3)
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, drawings, or income tax itself as a deduction
- NEVER skip the round-down to the nearest XAF 1,000 on the net taxable income
- NEVER rely on a [RESEARCH GAP] figure for a filed return without reviewer confirmation against the 2025 CGI
