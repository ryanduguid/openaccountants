# Cameroon Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — Research-verified.** Figures are sourced from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Cameroon) and the CNPS official site, corroborated by Employer-of-Record guides. This skill has **not** yet been section-by-section verified by a licensed Cameroon accountant (`verified_by: pending`). Treat all outputs as estimates pending professional sign-off. Where a figure could not be sourced to a primary authority it is flagged **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**.

| Validated by | Pending — requires sign-off by a licensed Cameroon accountant |
| Skill version | 0.1 |

> **No-PIT note:** This is **not** a no-PIT jurisdiction. Cameroon levies a progressive personal income tax (IRPP) on employment income, withheld monthly. Treat IRPP as a core employer withholding obligation.

## Section 2 — Income Tax Withholding (IRPP / PAYE)

The employer withholds IRPP monthly under the PAYE system. IRPP is progressive and applied to **annual net taxable salary** (the brackets below are annual; the monthly withholding is the annual liability divided by 12 for a stable salary).
Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/taxes-on-personal-income

### 2.1 IRPP Brackets (FY2025 — effective rates incl. 10% CAC)

The published bracket rates already incorporate the **Additional Council Tax (Centimes Additionnels Communaux, CAC)** surcharge of **10%** added to base IRPP. Base IRPP rates are 10% / 15% / 25% / 35%; × 1.10 CAC gives the effective rates below.

| Annual net taxable income (XAF) | Base rate | Effective rate (incl. 10% CAC) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,000,000 | 10% | **11%** |
| 2,000,001 – 3,000,000 | 15% | **16.5%** |
| 3,000,001 – 5,000,000 | 25% | **27.5%** |
| Over 5,000,000 | 35% | **38.5%** |

Source (brackets): https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/taxes-on-personal-income
Source (10% CAC): https://rivermate.com/guides/cameroon/taxes ; https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/hire-employees/payroll-tax/

**Cumulative tax at each bracket ceiling (effective, incl. CAC):**

| At annual net income (XAF) | Cumulative IRPP (XAF) |
|---|---|
| 2,000,000 | 220,000 |
| 3,000,000 | 385,000 |
| 5,000,000 | 935,000 |

*Check:* 2,000,000 × 11% = 220,000; + 1,000,000 × 16.5% = 165,000 → 385,000; + 2,000,000 × 27.5% = 550,000 → 935,000. Above 5,000,000 add 38.5% of the excess.

### 2.2 Net Taxable Salary — Computation Order

Apply in this exact order:

1. **Gross taxable salary** — all wages, salaries, cash and benefits in kind. Certain special-duty allowances and statutory family allowances are **exempt**.
   Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/income-determination
2. **Less employee CNPS pension contribution** (the 4.2% pension contribution is a deductible charge).
   Source: https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/hire-employees/payroll-tax/
3. **Less 30% lump-sum professional/business expense allowance** (computed on the post-CNPS taxable salary).
   Source: https://rivermate.com/guides/cameroon/taxes ; https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/hire-employees/payroll-tax/
4. **Less standard abatement of XAF 500,000** (annual) on employment income.
   Source: https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/hire-employees/payroll-tax/
5. **Round down to the nearest XAF 1,000**, then apply the progressive scale (result already includes the 10% CAC).
   Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/taxes-on-personal-income

## Section 3 — Salary-based Local Taxes (withheld with PAYE)

These flat local levies are withheld alongside IRPP on the DIPE declaration.

| Levy | Amount | Threshold | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Council tax** (Taxe Communale Libératoire) | ~XAF 2,520/month (top band) | Salaries above XAF 500,000/month | PwC, Other taxes |
| **Audiovisual royalty** (CRTV, redevance audiovisuelle) | up to XAF 13,000/month (top band) | Top band for gross salary above ~XAF 1,000,000/month | PwC, Other taxes |

Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/other-taxes

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The full council-tax and CRTV royalty **band tables** (intermediate bands) were not retrievable from a primary source. Only the **top-band amounts** (XAF 2,520 and XAF 13,000) and **thresholds** (XAF 500,000 / XAF 1,000,000) are confirmed by PwC. Source the intermediate bands from the CGI before relying on per-band figures. For salaries clearly above the top thresholds, the top-band amounts apply.

---

## Section 4 — Social Security (CNPS) — Contribution Rates

All CNPS branches are capped at a monthly contribution ceiling of **XAF 750,000** (XAF 9,000,000/year). Salary above the ceiling is **not** subject to CNPS.
Source: https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/other-taxes ; https://www.cnps.cm/en/assures/assure-e.html

| Branch | Employee | Employer | Base / ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Old-age / disability / survivor **pension** | **4.2%** | **4.2%** | salary capped at XAF 750,000/mo |
| **Family allowances** (general private sector) | 0% | **7.0%** | capped at XAF 750,000/mo |
| **Occupational accident** insurance (by risk class) | 0% | **1.75% / 2.5% / 5%** | capped at XAF 750,000/mo |
| **Total CNPS (excl. accident)** | **4.2%** | **11.2%** | |
| **Total CNPS (incl. accident)** | **4.2%** | **12.95% – 16.2%** | depends on risk class |

*Arithmetic check (employer, excl. accident):* 4.2% + 7.0% = **11.2%** ✓ (matches PwC's stated 11.2% employer figure).
*Incl. accident:* 11.2% + 1.75% = 12.95% (low risk); 11.2% + 5% = 16.2% (high risk). ✓

## Section 5 — Other Payroll Levies (CFC + FNE)

| Levy | Employee | Employer | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Housing Fund** — Crédit Foncier du Cameroun (CFC) | **1.0%** | **1.5%** | taxable salary | PwC, Other taxes |
| **National Employment Fund** (Fonds National de l'Emploi, FNE) | 0% | **1.0%** | taxable salary | PwC, Other taxes |
| **Total CFC + FNE** | **1.0%** | **2.5%** | | |

*Arithmetic check (employer):* 1.5% + 1.0% = **2.5%** ✓. PwC's corporate page describes the combined CFC + FNE as a **"payroll tax of 2.5% of total salaries and fringe benefits"** funding the Housing Loan and Employment Fund. The employee adds a separate 1.0% CFC.

Source (CFC 1.5% employer / 1% employee, FNE 1% employer): https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/individual/other-taxes
Source (combined 2.5% employer payroll tax): https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/republic-of-cameroon/corporate/other-taxes
Source (CFC 1.5%/1% corroboration): https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/employer-of-record/

> Unlike CNPS, the CFC and FNE are levied on **taxable salary** (no XAF 750,000 cap stated). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether any ceiling applies to CFC/FNE; PwC states no cap. The worked examples below assume CFC/FNE apply to the full taxable salary.

---

## Section 6 — Minimum Wage (SMIG) and Working Time

### 6.1 Minimum Wage (SMIG) — secondary sources

| Category | Monthly SMIG | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Private sector (non-agricultural) | XAF 60,000 (recent increase) | EOR guides (secondary) |
| Private sector (agricultural) | XAF 45,000 | EOR guides (secondary) |
| State employees | XAF 43,969 | EOR guides (secondary) |

Source (secondary): https://www.playroll.com/global-hiring-guides/cameroon ; https://remotepeople.com/countries/cameroon/employer-of-record/payroll-tax/

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** SMIG figures are from **secondary EOR sources only** and **disagree** across sources (XAF 41,875 vs 45,000 vs 60,000). Confirm the operative SMIG against the Ministry of Labour implementing decree before relying on it. Do **not** present a SMIG figure as definitive without this confirmation.

### 6.2 Working Time

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** Standard hours (commonly cited 40 hours/week under the Code du Travail), overtime multipliers, and weekly rest were not sourced to a primary authority in this pass. Confirm against the Code du Travail before computing overtime.

## Section 7 — Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **most conservative defensible assumption** and flag it for the reviewer. Never silently guess.

| Unknown / ambiguous input | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| CNPS occupational-accident risk class unknown | Use **2.5%** (mid band) and flag | Avoids understating employer cost; mid band is a defensible neutral |
| Family-allowance sector unclear | Use **7.0%** (general private sector) | Highest standard rate; reduced rates unconfirmed |
| Benefit-in-kind valuation uncertain | Include BIK at stated %s (housing 15%, electricity 4%, water 2%) and flag | Excluding BIK understates taxable salary |
| Council tax / CRTV band uncertain (salary above top threshold) | Apply **top band** (XAF 2,520 / XAF 13,000) | Top band confirmed; intermediate bands unconfirmed |
| Pay frequency unstated | Assume **monthly** | Standard Cameroon practice |
| Marital/dependant status (IRPP) | IRPP scale is **not** status-banded (single national scale) | Cameroon uses one progressive scale; no S/M codes |
| CFC/FNE ceiling uncertain | Apply to **full taxable salary** (no cap) | PwC states 2.5% on total salaries; no cap mentioned |
| SMIG value disputed | **Do not assume** — request confirmation | Sources disagree; flag as research gap |

Every default applied **must** be surfaced in the output as an explicit assumption line.

---

## Section 8 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### 8.1 Required Inputs

Before computing Cameroon payroll, you MUST have:

1. **Gross monthly salary in XAF** (and frequency, if not monthly).
2. **Components of pay** — basic, allowances, cash/in-kind benefits (to determine taxable vs exempt).
3. **CNPS occupational-accident risk class** (low 1.75% / mid 2.5% / high 5%) — or accept the 2.5% default with a flag.
4. **Whether any sector-specific reduced family-allowance rate applies** (default 7%).
5. **Whether the employer/employee are CNPS- and DGI-registered** (NIU and CNPS employer number).

### 8.2 Refusal Catalogue — STOP and request input if:

| Condition | Action |
|---|---|
| No gross salary figure provided | **Refuse** — cannot compute anything |
| Salary given in a currency other than XAF | **Refuse** — convert/confirm XAF first; never assume FX |
| Asked to compute SMIG-compliance as definitive | **Refuse to certify** — SMIG figure is a research gap; provide ranges only with disclaimer |
| Asked to file or sign a DIPE / tax return | **Refuse** — only a registered party / licensed professional may file |
| Asked to compute council tax / CRTV at an intermediate band | **Flag research gap** — only top band confirmed |
| Asked to treat output as professional advice | **Refuse** — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |

## Section 9 — Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic mapping of Cameroon bank-statement narratives (French/English) to payroll classifications. Match case-insensitively.

### 9.1 Salary Credits (employee side)

| Narrative pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SALAIRE`, `PAIE`, `VIREMENT SALAIRE`, `NET A PAYER` | Net salary payment |
| `VIREMENT [employer]`, `REMUNERATION` | Net salary payment |
| `PRIME`, `BONUS`, `GRATIFICATION`, `13E MOIS` | Bonus / gratuity (taxable) |
| `INDEMNITE` | Allowance — check exempt vs taxable per CGI |
| `REMB CNPS`, `REMBOURSEMENT CNPS` | CNPS refund — not income |

### 9.2 Employer Debits (employer side)

| Narrative pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `DGI`, `IMPOT`, `IRPP`, `DIPE`, `PRECOMPTE` | IRPP + salary-levy remittance to DGI |
| `CAC`, `CENTIMES ADDITIONNELS` | Additional Council Tax (within IRPP block) |
| `CNPS`, `COTISATION CNPS`, `PREVOYANCE SOCIALE` | CNPS contribution remittance |

## Section 10 — Worked Examples

> All examples use **FY2025** rates. CNPS ceiling XAF 750,000/mo. IRPP computed on annual net taxable salary then ÷12. Accident class assumed **mid (2.5%)** unless stated. Figures recomputed end-to-end.

### Example A — Junior employee, gross XAF 250,000/month (annual 3,000,000)

Bank line: `VIREMENT SALAIRE — JEAN M. — XAF 2xx,xxx`

| Step | Calc | XAF |
|---|---|---|
| Gross taxable (annual) | 250,000 × 12 | 3,000,000 |
| Less CNPS pension EE (4.2%, ≤ ceiling) | 4.2% × 250,000 × 12 | (126,000) |
| Post-CNPS | | 2,874,000 |
| Less 30% professional allowance | 30% × 2,874,000 | (862,200) |
| Less standard abatement | | (500,000) |
| Net taxable (rounded down to 1,000) | 1,511,800 → | **1,511,000** |
| IRPP (within 0–2m band @ 11%) | 11% × 1,511,000 | **166,210/yr** |
| Monthly IRPP | ÷ 12 | **13,851/mo** |

Monthly deductions (employee): CNPS pension 10,500 + CFC 1% (1% × 250,000 = 2,500) + IRPP 13,851 = **26,851**.
Net pay ≈ 250,000 − 26,851 = **XAF 223,149/mo** (excludes council tax/CRTV — salary below XAF 500,000 threshold, so neither applies).
*Council/CRTV check:* 250,000 < 500,000 → council tax not due; < 1,000,000 → CRTV top band not reached (lower bands a research gap).

### Example B — Mid employee, gross XAF 800,000/month (annual 9,600,000)

Bank line: `PAIE DU MOIS — A. NGUEMA — VIREMENT`

| Step | Calc | XAF |
|---|---|---|
| Gross taxable (annual) | 800,000 × 12 | 9,600,000 |
| Less CNPS pension EE (capped at ceiling) | 4.2% × 750,000 × 12 = 31,500 × 12 | (378,000) |
| Post-CNPS | | 9,222,000 |
| Less 30% professional allowance | 30% × 9,222,000 | (2,766,600) |
| Less standard abatement | | (500,000) |
| Net taxable (rounded to 1,000) | 5,955,400 → | **5,955,000** |
| IRPP — to 5,000,000 (cumulative) | | 935,000 |
| IRPP — excess @ 38.5% | 38.5% × (5,955,000 − 5,000,000) = 38.5% × 955,000 | 367,675 |
| Total IRPP | | **1,302,675/yr** |
| Monthly IRPP | ÷ 12 | **108,556/mo** |

Monthly employee deductions: CNPS pension **31,500** (capped) + CFC 1% (1% × 800,000 = 8,000) + IRPP 108,556 + council tax (above 500,000) **2,520** = **150,576**.
*CRTV:* 800,000 < 1,000,000 → top band not reached; lower band **[RESEARCH GAP]** — excluded.
Net pay ≈ 800,000 − 150,576 = **XAF 649,424/mo**.

### Example C — Employer monthly cost for Example B employee (gross 800,000)

| Employer levy | Calc | XAF/mo |
|---|---|---|
| CNPS pension (4.2%, capped) | 4.2% × 750,000 | 31,500 |
| CNPS family allowance (7%, capped) | 7% × 750,000 | 52,500 |
| CNPS accident (mid 2.5%, capped) | 2.5% × 750,000 | 18,750 |
| CFC employer (1.5% of taxable salary) | 1.5% × 800,000 | 12,000 |
| FNE employer (1.0% of taxable salary) | 1.0% × 800,000 | 8,000 |
| **Total employer on-costs** | | **122,750** |

Fully-loaded employer cost = 800,000 + 122,750 = **XAF 922,750/mo**.
*Check:* CNPS subtotal 31,500 + 52,500 + 18,750 = 102,750; CFC+FNE 12,000 + 8,000 = 20,000; total 122,750 ✓.

### Example D — High earner, gross XAF 1,500,000/month (annual 18,000,000)

| Step | Calc | XAF |
|---|---|---|
| Gross taxable (annual) | 1,500,000 × 12 | 18,000,000 |
| Less CNPS pension EE (capped) | 31,500 × 12 | (378,000) |
| Post-CNPS | | 17,622,000 |
| Less 30% professional allowance | 30% × 17,622,000 | (5,286,600) |
| Less standard abatement | | (500,000) |
| Net taxable (rounded to 1,000) | 11,835,400 → | **11,835,000** |
| IRPP — to 5,000,000 (cumulative) | | 935,000 |
| IRPP — excess @ 38.5% | 38.5% × (11,835,000 − 5,000,000) = 38.5% × 6,835,000 | 2,631,475 |
| Total IRPP | | **3,566,475/yr** |
| Monthly IRPP | ÷ 12 | **297,206/mo** |

Monthly employee deductions: CNPS pension 31,500 + CFC 1% (1% × 1,500,000 = 15,000) + IRPP 297,206 + council tax 2,520 (>500,000) + CRTV 13,000 (>1,000,000 → top band) = **359,226**.
Net pay ≈ 1,500,000 − 359,226 = **XAF 1,140,774/mo**.

### Example E — Worker at SMIG (illustrative only)

> SMIG is a **[RESEARCH GAP]**. Using the secondary figure XAF 60,000/month **for illustration only**: gross 60,000 < 500,000 → no council tax, no CRTV; below the first IRPP band after deductions the net taxable is likely **nil** (post-CNPS 60,000 − 2,520 = 57,480; less 30% and the 500,000 abatement → negative → IRPP = 0). Employee still bears CNPS pension 4.2% × 60,000 = **2,520** and CFC 1% = **600**. **Do not certify SMIG compliance** until the official figure is confirmed.

---

## Section 11 — Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — always apply)

1. IRPP brackets are **annual net taxable income**; the published 11%/16.5%/27.5%/38.5% rates already include the 10% CAC — never add CAC again.
2. CNPS contributions are **capped at XAF 750,000/month** per branch; never apply CNPS to salary above the ceiling.
3. The 4.2% employee CNPS pension is **deductible** before the 30% professional allowance and the 500,000 abatement.
4. Net-taxable computation order is fixed: gross → less CNPS pension → less 30% → less 500,000 → round down to 1,000 → apply scale.
5. CFC (1.5% employer / 1% employee) and FNE (1% employer) are levied on **taxable salary**; PwC states no ceiling.
6. Council tax applies only to salaries **above XAF 500,000/month**; CRTV top band only above ~XAF 1,000,000/month.
7. Employer total CNPS (excl. accident) is **exactly 11.2%** (4.2% pension + 7% family allowance); add accident 1.75/2.5/5% by risk class.
8. Monthly DIPE return + remittance is due by the **15th of the following month**.
9. All amounts are **XAF**; never assume a different currency or apply FX without explicit input.

## Section 12 — Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

Items requiring a licensed Cameroon accountant's judgement — flag, do not auto-decide:

| Item | Why it needs judgement |
|---|---|
| Benefit-in-kind valuation and caps | Full CGI BIK schedule is a research gap; housing/electricity/water %s confirmed but caps unconfirmed |
| Exempt allowances (special-duty, statutory family) | Exemption scope is fact-specific per CGI |
| Council tax / CRTV intermediate bands | Only top bands confirmed; intermediate bands a research gap |
| Sector-reduced family-allowance rates (agriculture/teachers) | Secondary-sourced only |
| Operative SMIG | Sources disagree; needs the labour decree |
| Occupational-accident risk classification | Class assignment is employer/sector-specific |
| Working time / overtime multipliers | Not sourced to the Code du Travail this pass |
| Annual recapitulative tier (DIPE) by taxpayer office | Depends on DGE / CIME / CDI classification |
| Expatriate / non-resident treatment, tax treaties | Out of scope of this base skill |

## Section 13 — Excel Working Paper Template

Suggested columns for a monthly Cameroon payroll working paper (one row per employee; XAF):

| Col | Header | Formula / source |

## Section 15 — Onboarding Fallback

If the client cannot supply complete payroll inputs:

1. **Minimum to start:** gross monthly salary in XAF + pay frequency. Without these, **refuse** (see §8.2).
2. If risk class is unknown, apply the **2.5% mid-band accident default** and flag.
3. If benefit-in-kind details are missing, compute on **cash salary only** and flag that BIK may increase the taxable base.
4. If registration status (NIU / CNPS number) is unknown, note that the employer **must** register with DGI and CNPS before lawful operation (§17) and proceed with computations marked "subject to registration."
5. Always output an **assumptions block** listing every default applied.

## Section 19 — Test Suite

Each test states inputs → expected output. Recompute to confirm before relying on the skill.

1. **CNPS pension cap.** Gross 800,000/mo. Expected employee pension = 4.2% × 750,000 = **31,500/mo** (capped, not 4.2% × 800,000). ✓
2. **Employer CNPS (excl. accident) at cap.** Expected 11.2% × 750,000 = pension 31,500 + family 52,500 = **84,000/mo**. ✓
3. **IRPP cumulative checkpoints.** At net taxable 2,000,000 → **220,000**; 3,000,000 → **385,000**; 5,000,000 → **935,000**. ✓
4. **Example A net taxable.** Gross 250,000/mo → net taxable **1,511,000**; annual IRPP **166,210**; monthly **13,851**. ✓
5. **Example B net taxable.** Gross 800,000/mo → net taxable **5,955,000**; annual IRPP **1,302,675**; monthly **108,556**. ✓
6. **Example B net pay.** 800,000 − (31,500 + 8,000 + 108,556 + 2,520) = **649,424/mo**. ✓
7. **Example C employer on-cost.** Gross 800,000, mid accident → **122,750/mo**; fully loaded **922,750/mo**. ✓
8. **Council-tax threshold.** Gross 250,000 (<500,000) → council tax **0**; gross 800,000 (>500,000) → **2,520**. ✓
9. **CRTV threshold.** Gross 800,000 (<1,000,000) → CRTV top band **not applied**; gross 1,500,000 (>1,000,000) → **13,000**. ✓
10. **Example D high earner.** Gross 1,500,000/mo → net taxable **11,835,000**; annual IRPP **3,566,475**; monthly **297,206**; net pay **1,140,774**. ✓
11. **CFC+FNE employer.** Gross 800,000 → CFC 12,000 + FNE 8,000 = **20,000/mo** (2.5% × 800,000 = 20,000). ✓
12. **CAC not double-counted.** Net taxable 1,000,000 → IRPP = 11% × 1,000,000 = **110,000** (using effective rate; do NOT add a further 10%). ✓
13. **Late-declaration penalty cap.** 10%/month capped at **30%**; late-payment interest 1.5%/month capped at **50%**. ✓
14. **SMIG refusal.** Asked to certify SMIG compliance → **flag research gap, do not certify**. ✓

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER add the 10% CAC again — the 11%/16.5%/27.5%/38.5% rates already include it.
- NEVER apply CNPS contributions to salary above the XAF 750,000/month ceiling.
- NEVER omit the employer family-allowance contribution (7%) or the CFC/FNE levies (2.5% combined employer) from employer cost.
- NEVER compute IRPP on gross salary — always run the full net-taxable order (CNPS pension → 30% → 500,000 abatement → round down).
- NEVER apply council tax or CRTV below their thresholds (XAF 500,000 / ~XAF 1,000,000).
- NEVER present a SMIG figure as definitive — it is an unresolved research gap.
- NEVER state intermediate council-tax or CRTV bands as fact — only top bands are confirmed.
- NEVER assume a currency other than XAF, or apply an FX rate without explicit input.
- NEVER miss the 15th-of-following-month DIPE deadline — penalties (10%/month up to 30%, plus interest) apply.
- NEVER file or sign a DIPE / tax return on the client's behalf.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Cameroon accountant.
