# Luxembourg Payroll Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 (research-verified).** The 2025 income tax scale (post "Entlaaschtungs-Pak" +2.5 index-bracket adjustment), the solidarity surcharge and the CIS/CISSM/CIM tax credits are confirmed against PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries. The CCSS contribution rate table (sickness 2.80%+2.80%, pension 8%+8%, dependency 1.40%, accident base 0.700%, Mutualite des Employeurs 0.07-2.64%, sante au travail 0.14%) is taken directly from the official CCSS *Avis aux employeurs - Taux de cotisation au 01.01.2025* (notice of 17.01.2025) and is firm. The min/max contribution base and the May 2025 indexation are corroborated from Orbitax and WAT Fiduciary. The live CCSS HTML "parametres sociaux" page and several Big-4 newsletter pages returned HTTP 403 to automated fetch, so the official CCSS PDF and Orbitax/WAT were used to corroborate the May 2025 figures. Figures carry **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** markers where the primary authority figure could not be pinned to a single fixed published value (notably class 1a withholding mechanics and the exact statutory penalty for late annual-statement filing).

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Monthly PAYE via the Tax Card)

The employer withholds income tax each pay period under the wage-withholding provisions of the LIR (retenue d'impot sur les salaires), reading the withholding from the **official monthly/daily withholding tax tables (bareme) published by the ACD** based on the employee's **tax class** and the data on the **electronic withholding tax card (fiche de retenue d'impot)**. Since 01.01.2022 employees no longer hand a paper card to the employer; the ACD transmits the card data electronically. The withholding includes the solidarity surcharge. (Source: guichet.public.lu retenue-impot.)

### Tax Classes (2025)

| Tax class | Who (broadly) |
|---|---|
| 1 | Single, no children |
| 1a | Single parents; persons aged 65+; certain widow(er)s (higher tax-free allowance, ~EUR 26,460 for 2025) |
| 2 | Married / civil-partnership couples taxed jointly, using income-splitting |

The withholding tables differ by class. This skill enumerates the **class 1** marginal scale from the research data; class 1a applies a higher tax-free allowance and class 2 broadly applies the class-1 scale to half of joint income ("splitting"). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact class 1a tax-free allowance (~EUR 26,460 is reported by secondary summaries) and the class 1a / class 2 withholding-table mechanics against the ACD bareme; only the class 1 marginal scale is enumerated below.]** (Source: PwC LU 2025.)

### 2025 Income Tax Scale -- Tax Class 1 (marginal rates)

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (Luxembourg, Individual, Taxes on personal income). Post "Entlaaschtungs-Pak" +2.5 index-bracket adjustment of 1 January 2025. Marginal rates applied to annual taxable income.

| Taxable Income (EUR) | Marginal Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 13,230 | 0% |
| 13,230 -- 15,435 | 8% |
| 15,435 -- 17,640 | 9% |
| 17,640 -- 19,845 | 10% |
| 19,845 -- 22,050 | 11% |
| 22,050 -- 24,255 | 12% |
| 24,255 -- 26,550 | 14% |
| 26,550 -- 28,845 | 16% |
| 28,845 -- 31,140 | 18% |
| 31,140 -- 33,435 | 20% |
| 33,435 -- 35,730 | 22% |
| 35,730 -- 38,025 | 24% |
| 38,025 -- 40,320 | 26% |
| 40,320 -- 42,615 | 28% |
| 42,615 -- 44,910 | 30% |
| 44,910 -- 47,205 | 32% |
| 47,205 -- 49,500 | 34% |
| 49,500 -- 51,795 | 36% |
| 51,795 -- 54,090 | 38% |
| 54,090 -- 117,450 | 39% |
| 117,450 -- 176,160 | 40% |
| 176,160 -- 234,870 | 41% |
| 234,870+ | 42% (top marginal) |

### Solidarity Surcharge (contribution au fonds pour l'emploi)

On top of the income tax due, a **solidarity surcharge** (employment-fund contribution) applies, withheld together with income tax:

- **7%** of the income tax due (standard), rising to
- **9%** where taxable income exceeds **EUR 150,000** (tax classes 1 and 1a) or **EUR 300,000** (tax class 2).

The surcharge funds the *Fonds pour l'emploi*. The **top effective marginal rate** is therefore approximately **45.78%** (42% x 1.09). Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries.

### No Valid Tax Card

If **no valid withholding tax card exists**, the employer must apply the **highest rate: tax class 1, at a rate that cannot be lower than 33%**. Source: guichet.public.lu retenue-impot.

### Tax Credits Applied Through Withholding

The employer **offsets** the following credits against the withholding where the tax card shows them due:

| Credit | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Employee tax credit (CIS -- credit d'impot salarie) | EUR 0 -- 600/year, income-dependent | Granted via the tax card; offset against withholding |
| Social minimum wage tax credit (CISSM -- credit d'impot salaire social minimum) | EUR 81/month for gross EUR 1,800 -- 3,000; degressive from EUR 3,000 to EUR 3,600 (formula 81/600 x (3,600 - gross)); EUR 0 above EUR 3,600 | Set so an unskilled-minimum-wage earner has nil tax in all classes for 2025 |
| Single-parent tax credit (CIM -- credit d'impot monoparental) | EUR 750 -- 3,504/year, income-dependent | Tax class 1a |

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries; guichet.public.lu (CISSM).

### PAYE Computation Method

1. Read the employee's **tax class** and any noted deductions/credits from the electronic tax card transmitted by the ACD.
2. Determine taxable income for the period (gross emoluments less the deductible employee social contributions and any card-noted deductions).
3. Look up the withholding from the ACD official monthly/daily withholding table (bareme) for that class; this implicitly applies the class scale (class 1 scale above) and adds the solidarity surcharge (7%, or 9% above the EUR 150,000 / 300,000 thresholds).
4. Offset the CIS / CISSM / CIM credits shown on the card.
5. If no valid card exists, withhold at class 1, minimum 33%.

The 0% band (to EUR 13,230 for class 1) **is** the tax-free allowance — there is no separate personal allowance on top of it.

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (CCSS)

The CCSS is the **single collector** of all Luxembourg social contributions. The employee bears four branches; the CCSS invoices the employer the combined employee + employer amount, and the employer deducts the employee share from wages. (Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025.)

### Employee Contribution Rates (2025)

| Branch | Rate | Base | Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pension (assurance pension) | 8.00% | Gross remuneration | Max base 5 x SSM (see below) |
| Sickness -- in kind (prestations en nature) | 2.80% | Gross remuneration | Same max base as pension |
| Sickness -- cash (majoration prestations en especes) | 0.25% | Gross remuneration (only insured persons entitled to cash sick pay) | Same max base as pension |
| Dependency / long-term care (assurance dependance) | 1.40% | Gross income **less an abatement of 1/4 of the SSM** | **NO floor or ceiling** |

- Combined employee **sickness** rate = 2.80% + 0.25% = **3.05%**.
- **Total employee deduction (excluding tax)** on income within the ceiling = 8.00% + 3.05% + 1.40% = **~12.45%** (the 1.40% dependency portion is on a different, uncapped, post-abatement base).

Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025.

### The Dependency-Insurance Abatement (material)

The dependency contribution (1.40%, employee only) is **not** levied on gross. The base is gross professional income **reduced by an abatement of 1/4 of the SSM**:

| Period | Monthly abatement (1/4 of SSM) |
|---|---|
| 1 Jan 2025 (index 944.43) | EUR 659.45 |
| From 1 May 2025 (index 968.04) | EUR 675.94 |

The dependency contribution has **no minimum and no maximum ceiling** — it applies to the full (post-abatement) income even above the 5 x SSM cap that limits the other branches. Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025; PwC LU Other taxes.

### Social-Contribution Ceiling (Max Base) and Floor (Min Base)

| Parameter | 1 Jan 2025 (index 944.43) | From 1 May 2025 (index 968.04) |
|---|---|---|
| Maximum monthly base (5 x SSM) | EUR 13,188.96 | EUR 13,518.68 |
| Minimum monthly base (= SSM unskilled) | EUR 2,637.79 | EUR 2,703.74 |
| Annual maximum base | approx EUR 162,224 (12 x 13,518.68) | approx EUR 162,224 (12 x 13,518.68) |

The 2.5% automatic wage indexation took effect **1 May 2025** (index moved 944.43 -> 968.04). Use the Jan 2025 set for Jan--Apr 2025 pay periods and the May 2025 set from May 2025 onward. Sources: CCSS Avis 17.01.2025; Orbitax (May 2025); WAT Fiduciary.

## Section 4 -- Social Security -- Employer Contributions (CCSS + Employer-Only Funds)

The employer matches the employee on pension and sickness, and additionally pays accident insurance, occupational health and the Mutualite des Employeurs — all employer-only. (Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025.)

### Employer Contribution Rates (2025)

| Branch | Rate | Base | Ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension (assurance pension) | 8.00% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Mirrors employee (+ 8.00% State; total 24.00%) |
| Sickness -- in kind | 2.80% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Mirrors employee |
| Sickness -- cash | 0.25% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Mirrors employee (cash-benefit majoration) |
| Accident insurance (assurance accident) | 0.700% base | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Employer-only; base 0.700% adjusted by a bonus-malus factor (see below) |
| Occupational health (sante au travail, STM) | 0.14% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Employer-only; private-sector employers using the multi-sector occupational health service (STM) |
| Mutualite des Employeurs (MDE) | 0.07% / 0.99% / 1.48% / 2.64% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | Employer-only; by financial-absenteeism risk class (see below) |
| Family benefits (prestations familiales) | 1.70% | Gross remuneration | 5 x SSM | **PUBLIC-sector employers ONLY**; private-sector employers pay **0%** (state-funded) |

> The employer does **NOT** pay the dependency (long-term care) contribution — that 1.40% is **employee only**. Private-sector employers do **NOT** pay the 1.70% family-benefits contribution.

### Accident Insurance Bonus-Malus (2025)

The accident rate is a base **0.700%** adjusted by an employer-specific **bonus-malus factor** set per employer by the Accident Insurance Association:

| Bonus-malus factor | Effective rate |
|---|---|
| 0.85 | 0.595% |
| 1.00 (default) | 0.700% |
| 1.10 | 0.770% |
| 1.30 | 0.910% |
| 1.50 | 1.050% |

Use **0.700% with factor 1.00** as the default unless the employer's notified factor is known. Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025.

### Mutualite des Employeurs (MDE) -- Absenteeism Classes (2025)

The MDE reimburses the employer continued pay during employee sickness. The rate depends on the employer's **financial-absenteeism risk class**:

| Class | Financial absenteeism | Rate (2025) |
|---|---|---|
| Class 1 | < 0.65% | 0.07% |
| Class 2 | < 1.60% | 0.99% |
| Class 3 | < 2.50% | 1.48% |
| Class 4 | >= 2.50% | 2.64% |

The actual class is assigned by the CCSS based on the employer's financial-absenteeism rate. Source: CCSS Avis aux employeurs 17.01.2025.

### Typical Private-Sector Employer On-Cost (MDE Class 2, accident factor 1.00)

Pension 8.00% + Sickness 3.05% + Accident 0.700% + Occupational health 0.14% + MDE 0.99% = **~12.88%** of gross within the ceiling (family benefits 1.70% is **not** included — it is public-sector only).

> Note: figures vary with the MDE class and the accident bonus-malus factor — both are employer-specific. The State also pays an additional 8.00% pension contribution that is **not** an employer payroll cost.

## Section 5 -- Social Minimum Wage (SSM) and Reference Items

### Social Minimum Wage (salaire social minimum, SSM) -- full-time monthly gross

| Category | 1 Jan 2025 (index 944.43) | From 1 May 2025 (index 968.04) |
|---|---|---|
| Unskilled, aged 18+ (non qualifie) | EUR 2,637.79 | EUR 2,703.74 |
| Skilled, aged 18+ (qualifie, approx +20%) | EUR 3,165.31 | EUR 3,244.48 |
| Aged 17-18 (80% of SSM) | EUR 2,110.23 | [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm May 2025 figure] |
| Aged 15-17 (75% of SSM) | EUR 1,978.34 | [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm May 2025 figure] |

SSM = EUR 279.30 at index 100; cost-of-living index 944.43 at 01.01.2025, rising to 968.04 from 01.05.2025 (+2.5%). Sources: CCSS Avis 17.01.2025; WAT Fiduciary (May 2025). The minimum **social-contribution base** equals the SSM unskilled.

### Other Reference Items

| Item | Amount | Notes / Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employee tax credit (CIS) | EUR 0 -- 600/year | Income-dependent; via tax card (PwC) |
| Social minimum wage tax credit (CISSM) | EUR 81/month (gross EUR 1,800 -- 3,000); degressive to EUR 0 at EUR 3,600 | Formula 81/600 x (3,600 - gross) between EUR 3,000 and 3,600 (PwC; Guichet.lu) |
| Single-parent tax credit (CIM) | EUR 750 -- 3,504/year | Tax class 1a (PwC) |
| Class 1a tax-free allowance (2025) | ~EUR 26,460 | [RESEARCH GAP — reported by secondary summaries; verify against ACD bareme] |

> Statutory leave, the 13th month and overtime premia are **not** enumerated in the research data for this skill. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Luxembourg statutory annual leave, public holidays, sick-pay continuation rules and any 13th-month / bonus treatment before relying on them.]**

## Section 6 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is ambiguous, apply the conservative default and flag for the reviewer rather than guessing.

| Ambiguity | Conservative Default |
|---|---|
| Accident insurance rate | **0.700%** (base, bonus-malus factor 1.00). Use the unadjusted base rate unless the employer's specific factor from the Accident Insurance Association is known. |
| Mutualite des Employeurs class | New/unrated employers are placed by CCSS into a class based on financial absenteeism; if unknown, model a **mid class** rather than assuming the lowest (0.07%). Replace with the employer's actual notified class. |
| Family benefits (prestations familiales) 1.70% | Apply **only** for PUBLIC-sector employers; for private-sector payroll set to **0%** (state-funded). |
| Occupational health (sante au travail) 0.14% | Apply only if the private-sector employer uses the multi-sector occupational health service (STM); employers with their own/in-house or sector service may differ. |
| Which 2025 index / parameter set | Use the **1 Jan 2025** set (index 944.43; SSM 2,637.79; ceiling 13,188.96; abatement 659.45) for Jan--Apr 2025; the **1 May 2025** set (index 968.04; SSM 2,703.74; ceiling 13,518.68; abatement 675.94) from 1 May 2025. |
| Tax class | If the tax card is not available, **do not guess** — flag for the card. If no valid card exists, the employer must withhold at the least favourable basis (class 1, min 33%). Trigger R-LU-P-1. |
| Dependency base | Apply 1.40% on gross **less the 1/4-SSM abatement** with **no floor or ceiling** — do not apply the 5 x SSM cap to dependency. |
| Solidarity surcharge | 7% of income tax due; step up to 9% only above EUR 150,000 (class 1/1a) or EUR 300,000 (class 2) taxable income. |
| Reliefs / deductions | Compute withholding on gross less only the deductible employee social contributions and card-noted items. Do not assume discretionary deductions. |

## Section 7 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — for each employee: gross monthly remuneration, the tax class from the **fiche de retenue d'impot (electronic tax card)**, pay frequency, and the period being run. The employer's **matricule employeur** (CCSS registration number).

**Recommended** — date of hire (CCSS entry declaration), whether the employer is public or private sector (for the 1.70% family-benefits contribution), the MDE absenteeism class, the accident bonus-malus factor, any card-noted CIS/CISSM/CIM credits, prior-month cumulative figures, and any non-cash benefits.

**Ideal** — full employee register, the CCSS monthly contribution statements/invoices, prior MyGuichet.lu withholding declarations, and prior-year salary-statement data for reconciliation.

### Luxembourg-Specific Refusal Catalogue

**R-LU-P-1 — No tax card.** *Trigger:* the employee's tax class / fiche de retenue d'impot is not available. *Message:* "Wage withholding requires the employee's electronic tax card (fiche de retenue d'impot) data; without it the tax class and credits cannot be applied. Obtain the card data before running tax withholding — otherwise the employer must withhold at class 1, minimum 33%."

**R-LU-P-2 — Self-employed / non-salaried.** *Trigger:* the worker is self-employed (independant) or a company director not on a salary. *Message:* "Self-employed and non-salaried persons are not run through employer wage withholding; their social security and tax are handled separately. Use the Luxembourg income-tax / self-employed skill."

**R-LU-P-3 — Cross-border / frontalier / posted worker.** *Trigger:* a cross-border worker (frontalier), an A1/E101 certificate, or a totalisation question. *Message:* "Cross-border social security coordination (EU Reg. 883/2004, A1 certificates) and frontalier tax treatment require specialist advice."

**R-LU-P-4 — Impatriate / expat regime.** *Trigger:* a high-earner claiming the impatriate tax regime or the inpatriate premium. *Message:* "The Luxembourg impatriate regime and inpatriate premium have specific conditions and affect withholding; route through a Luxembourg reviewer."

**R-LU-P-5 — Benefits in kind / equity.** *Trigger:* company car, accommodation, stock options or other benefits in kind. *Message:* "Benefit-in-kind valuation (company car, housing, equity) affects taxable income and contributions; route through a Luxembourg reviewer."

**R-LU-P-6 — Termination / severance.** *Trigger:* severance, ex-gratia, or redundancy lump sum. *Message:* "Termination payments have specific tax and social treatment; do not run through standard wage withholding."

## Section 9 -- Worked Examples

All figures use the **1 May 2025** parameter set (index 968.04) unless stated: SSM unskilled EUR 2,703.74; max base EUR 13,518.68/month; dependency abatement EUR 675.94/month. Tax withholding shown is **illustrative** (tax class 1, before/after card-noted credits) — exact monthly withholding comes from the ACD bareme using the tax card, so a Luxembourg reviewer must confirm. Employer on-cost assumes a **private-sector** employer with **MDE Class 2 (0.99%)** and **accident factor 1.00 (0.700%)**.

### Example 1 — Unskilled minimum-wage employee (monthly EUR 2,703.74, class 1)

**Bank statement line (employer):**
`30.05.2025 ; VIREMENT SALAIRES -- A. WEBER ; DEBIT ; Salaire mai ; -2,376.59 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Gross EUR 2,703.74. Employee social contributions: pension 8.00% = EUR 216.30; sickness 3.05% = EUR 82.46; dependency 1.40% on (2,703.74 − 675.94 abatement) = 1.40% × 2,027.80 = EUR 28.39. Employee social total = 216.30 + 82.46 + 28.39 = EUR 327.15. For tax, the CISSM credit is designed so an **unskilled-minimum-wage earner has nil tax in all classes for 2025** — illustrative withholding ≈ EUR 0 after CISSM/CIS. Net ≈ 2,703.74 − 327.15 = **EUR 2,376.59** (illustrative).

| Item | Base | Rate | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gross | -- | -- | 2,703.74 |
| Employee pension | 2,703.74 | 8.00% | 216.30 |
| Employee sickness | 2,703.74 | 3.05% | 82.46 |
| Employee dependency | 2,027.80 (post-abatement) | 1.40% | 28.39 |
| Wage withholding (after CISSM/CIS) | -- | illustrative | ~0.00 |
| **Net pay (illustrative)** | -- | -- | **~2,376.59** |

### Example 2 — Mid earner (monthly EUR 4,500, class 1)

**Bank statement line (employee credit):**
`30.06.2025 ; EMPLOYEUR SARL VIREMENT ; CREDIT ; Salaire juin ; +3,5xx.xx ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Gross EUR 4,500, within the ceiling. Employee pension 8.00% = EUR 360.00; sickness 3.05% = EUR 137.25; dependency 1.40% × (4,500 − 675.94) = 1.40% × 3,824.06 = EUR 53.54. Employee social total = 360.00 + 137.25 + 53.54 = EUR 550.79. Gross is above EUR 3,600 so **no CISSM**; a small CIS may apply via the card. Annual taxable ≈ 12 × (4,500 − 550.79) ≈ EUR 47,390; class-1 income tax + 7% solidarity, divided across the year. Withholding here is **illustrative** — the exact monthly figure comes from the ACD bareme using the tax card. **[RESEARCH GAP — exact monthly withholding requires the ACD class-1 withholding table; only the marginal scale is enumerated.]**

| Item (monthly) | Base | Rate | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gross | -- | -- | 4,500.00 |
| Employee pension | 4,500.00 | 8.00% | 360.00 |
| Employee sickness | 4,500.00 | 3.05% | 137.25 |
| Employee dependency | 3,824.06 (post-abatement) | 1.40% | 53.54 |
| Wage withholding (income tax + 7% solidarity) | -- | per bareme | illustrative |
| **Net pay** | -- | -- | 3,949.21 − withholding |

### Example 3 — High earner above the ceiling (monthly EUR 16,000, class 1)

**Bank statement line (employer debit, CCSS):**
`05.07.2025 ; CENTRE COMMUN SECURITE SOCIALE ; DEBIT ; Cotisations juin ; -4,1xx.xx ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly EUR 16,000 exceeds the max base EUR 13,518.68. Capped branches (pension, sickness, accident, occupational health, MDE) apply only to EUR 13,518.68. **Dependency has no ceiling** and is on the **full** post-abatement income: 1.40% × (16,000 − 675.94) = 1.40% × 15,324.06 = EUR 214.54.

| Item (monthly) | Base | Rate | Amount (EUR) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee pension | 13,518.68 (capped) | 8.00% | 1,081.49 |
| Employee sickness | 13,518.68 (capped) | 3.05% | 412.32 |
| Employee dependency | 15,324.06 (**uncapped**, post-abatement) | 1.40% | 214.54 |
| Employer pension | 13,518.68 (capped) | 8.00% | 1,081.49 |
| Employer sickness | 13,518.68 (capped) | 3.05% | 412.32 |
| Employer accident | 13,518.68 (capped) | 0.700% | 94.63 |
| Employer occupational health | 13,518.68 (capped) | 0.14% | 18.93 |
| Employer MDE (Class 2) | 13,518.68 (capped) | 0.99% | 133.83 |
| **Employer on-cost (CCSS, ex-State, private sector)** | -- | -- | **1,741.20** |

Employer on-cost = 1,081.49 + 412.32 + 94.63 + 18.93 + 133.83 = EUR 1,741.20. The employee dependency (EUR 214.54) is on the **full** EUR 15,324.06 post-abatement, **not** the capped EUR 13,518.68. The employer pays **no** dependency and (private sector) **no** family benefits.

### Example 4 — Index boundary (Jan--Apr 2025 vs May 2025)

**Reasoning:**
For a Jan--Apr 2025 pay period, use the **index 944.43** set: SSM unskilled EUR 2,637.79, max base EUR 13,188.96, dependency abatement EUR 659.45. From the May 2025 pay period, switch to the **index 968.04** set (EUR 2,703.74 / EUR 13,518.68 / EUR 675.94). For an unskilled-minimum-wage employee, the Jan gross is EUR 2,637.79 and the May gross is EUR 2,703.74 — a 2.5% indexation uplift (2,637.79 × 1.025 = 2,703.74). Always confirm which pay period you are running before selecting the parameter set.

### Example 5 — CCSS combined remittance

**Bank statement line (employer debit):**
`10.07.2025 ; CCSS CENTRE COMMUN ; DEBIT ; Facture cotisations juin ; -3,4xx.xx ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
The CCSS issues a **monthly account statement (extrait de compte)** invoicing the employer the combined employee + employer social contributions. The employer deducts the employee share from wages and remits the **full** invoiced amount; the **balance is payable within 10 days of the statement's issue**. Classify as a CCSS social-contribution remittance (a mix of expense — the employer share — and liability — the withheld employee share), **not** an employee salary payment. Late payment carries **default interest of 0.6% per full calendar month**. Source: CCSS recouvrement / facturation.

### Example 6 — Wage withholding remittance via MyGuichet.lu

**Bank statement line (employer debit):**
`09.04.2025 ; ACD RETENUE IMPOT ; DEBIT ; RTS Q1 / mars ; -8xx.xx ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
This is the wage withholding tax (income tax + solidarity surcharge) withheld from employees, declared and paid via MyGuichet.lu on the *Declaration de la retenue d'impot sur remunerations et des credits d'impot bonifies*. **Remittance frequency** depends on monthly withholding: **monthly** if >= EUR 750; **quarterly** if EUR 75 -- 749; **annually** if < EUR 75. The declaration and payment are due **by the 10th of the month following the period** (e.g. by 10 April for March / Q1). Classify as a wage-withholding remittance, not an expense to the employee. Source: guichet.public.lu retenue-impot.

11. **Minimum contribution base = SSM unskilled (aged 18+):** EUR 2,637.79/month (1 Jan 2025) then EUR 2,703.74/month (1 May 2025). Skilled SSM is ~+20% (EUR 3,165.31 then EUR 3,244.48). (CCSS Avis 17.01.2025; WAT Fiduciary.)
12. **The CCSS invoices the employer** the combined employee + employer contributions monthly (extrait de compte); the employer deducts the employee share and remits the full amount, payable within **10 days** of the statement's issue. (CCSS recouvrement.)
13. **Wage withholding remittance frequency:** monthly if monthly withholding >= EUR 750; quarterly if EUR 75--749; annually if < EUR 75; declared and paid via MyGuichet.lu by the **10th** of the month following the period. (guichet.public.lu retenue-impot.)
14. **Tax credits:** CIS EUR 0--600/year; CIM EUR 750--3,504/year (class 1a); CISSM EUR 81/month for gross EUR 1,800--3,000, degressive to zero at EUR 3,600. (PwC; Guichet.lu.)

## Section 13 -- Luxembourg Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

**CSV conventions.** BGL BNP Paribas, Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat (Spuerkeess), Banque Internationale a Luxembourg (BIL) and Banque Raiffeisen typically use semicolon or comma delimiters and DD/MM/YYYY dates. EUR only. Statements often mix French, German and Luxembourgish narratives.

**Language variants (treat as English equivalent):**

| French / German / Luxembourgish | English |
|---|---|
| Salaire / Traitement / Lohn / Gehalt | Salary |
| Paie / Masse salariale / Lohnlauf | Payroll run |
| Securite sociale / CCSS / Centre commun | Social security (CCSS bundle) |
| Retenue d'impot / RTS / Lohnsteuer | Wage withholding tax |
| Fonds pour l'emploi / Solidarite | Solidarity surcharge (employment fund) |
| Assurance dependance / Pflegeversicherung | Dependency / long-term care insurance |
| Assurance accident / Unfallversicherung | Accident insurance |
| Sante au travail / Arbeitsmedizin | Occupational health |
| Mutualite des Employeurs / MDE | Employer mutual insurance |
| Prestations familiales | Family benefits |
| Heures supplementaires / Ueberstunden | Overtime |

**Authority counterparties.** "ACD" / "Administration des contributions directes" / "Contributions directes" / "MyGuichet" = the tax authority (wage withholding). "CCSS" / "Centre commun de la securite sociale" / "Securite sociale" = the single social-contribution collector (pension, sickness, dependency, accident, occupational health, MDE — and, for public-sector employers, family benefits — all in one invoice / extrait de compte).

**IBAN prefix.** LU = Luxembourg.

## Section 16 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (wage withholding + CCSS) | **This skill (luxembourg-payroll.md)** |
| Resident/employee personal income tax | luxembourg-income-tax.md |
| Social contributions detail | luxembourg-social-contributions.md |
| Luxembourg VAT returns | luxembourg-vat-return.md |
| Employer corporate tax | luxembourg-corporate-tax.md |
| Cross-border / frontalier / A1 / treaty | cross-border skill |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and all employer contributions (pension, sickness, accident, occupational health, MDE, plus family benefits if public sector) are expenses; wage withholding and the employee social share are liabilities until remitted to the ACD / CCSS.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** Employment income and withholding feed the employee's annual income tax assessment and the employer's annual salary statement (extrait de compte salaire) to the ACD.
- **Payroll → Self-employed:** Self-employed and non-salaried persons are handled outside payroll.

### Known Gaps

1. Class 1a tax-free allowance (~EUR 26,460 for 2025) and the class 1a / class 2 withholding-table mechanics are reported by secondary summaries; verify against the ACD bareme.
2. Only the **class 1** marginal scale is enumerated; exact monthly withholding amounts require the ACD class-by-class withholding tables.
3. The accident bonus-malus factor (0.595%--1.050%) and the MDE absenteeism class are employer-specific and assigned by the relevant institutions; replace defaults with the employer's notified rates.
4. The occupational-health rate (0.14%) assumes the multi-sector service (STM); employers with their own/sector service may differ.
5. Family benefits 1.70% applies to **public-sector** employers only; private-sector payroll sets it to 0%.
6. The 17-18 (80%) and 15-17 (75%) SSM rates are given for Jan 2025; the May 2025 equivalents are not enumerated in the research data.
7. The exact statutory penalty for late/non-filing of the annual salary statement (additional tax vs fine) is not published as a single fixed figure.
8. A separate state pension reform raised the pension contribution rate for **2026** (from 8% to 8.05% per party); this is **out of scope** for 2025 and must NOT be applied to 2025 payroll.
9. The live CCSS HTML "parametres sociaux" page and several Big-4 newsletter pages returned HTTP 403 to automated fetch; figures are anchored to the official CCSS 17.01.2025 PDF and corroborated by Orbitax/WAT — a reviewer should confirm against the CCSS table before filing.

### Test Suite

A correct implementation should pass each of these checks (May 2025 / index 968.04 parameter set unless noted):

1. **0% band:** A class-1 employee with annual taxable income within EUR 13,230 has **EUR 0 income tax** before the solidarity surcharge.
2. **Unskilled minimum wage nil tax:** An unskilled-SSM earner (EUR 2,703.74/month) has **nil wage tax in all classes** for 2025 after the CISSM/CIS credits.
3. **No valid card:** With no valid tax card, withholding is at **class 1, minimum 33%**.
4. **Employee social rate:** A within-ceiling employee deducts pension 8.00% + sickness 3.05% + dependency 1.40% (on the post-abatement base) — the dependency base is **not** the gross.
5. **Dependency abatement:** Dependency base = gross − EUR 675.94 (May 2025); e.g. on EUR 4,500 → 1.40% × 3,824.06 = **EUR 53.54**.
6. **Dependency uncapped:** On EUR 16,000/month, dependency is 1.40% × (16,000 − 675.94) = **EUR 214.54** — computed on the **full** post-abatement income, **not** the EUR 13,518.68 ceiling.
7. **Ceiling on other branches:** On EUR 16,000/month, pension is 8.00% × 13,518.68 (capped) = **EUR 1,081.49** — **not** 8.00% × 16,000.
8. **Employer on-cost (Ex.3):** 1,081.49 + 412.32 + 94.63 + 18.93 + 133.83 = **EUR 1,741.20** (private sector, MDE Class 2, accident 0.700%).
9. **No employer dependency:** The employer pays **EUR 0** dependency; it is employee-only.
10. **No private-sector family benefits:** A private-sector employer pays **EUR 0** family benefits; the 1.70% is public-sector only.
11. **Accident employer-only:** Accident base 0.700% (factor 1.00 default) is paid by the employer only; employee EUR 0.
12. **MDE classes:** Class 1 = 0.07%, Class 2 = 0.99%, Class 3 = 1.48%, Class 4 = 2.64%.
13. **Solidarity surcharge:** 7% of income tax due; step to 9% only above EUR 150,000 (class 1/1a) / EUR 300,000 (class 2) taxable income.
14. **Index boundary:** Jan--Apr 2025 uses SSM EUR 2,637.79 / max base EUR 13,188.96 / abatement EUR 659.45 (index 944.43); from May 2025 uses EUR 2,703.74 / EUR 13,518.68 / EUR 675.94 (index 968.04).
15. **Withholding frequency:** Monthly withholding >= EUR 750 → monthly; EUR 75--749 → quarterly; < EUR 75 → annually; due by the 10th of the following month via MyGuichet.lu.
16. **CCSS combined remittance:** The CCSS invoices employee + employer combined (extrait de compte); the employer remits the full amount within 10 days; late payment = 0.6%/month default interest.
17. **CCSS entry deadline:** A new hire must be declared (declaration d'entree) within 8 days; >30 days late = EUR 50/month, max EUR 2,500.
18. **Annual salary statement:** The extrait de compte salaire for tax year 2025 is due before **1 March 2026**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER run wage withholding without the employee's tax card (fiche de retenue d'impot) data — without a valid card the employer must withhold at class 1, minimum 33%; trigger R-LU-P-1.
- NEVER compute the dependency contribution on gross — it is on gross **less the 1/4-SSM abatement** (EUR 675.94/month from May 2025; EUR 659.45 Jan--Apr) and has **NO floor or ceiling**.
- NEVER apply the 5 x SSM ceiling to the dependency contribution — only pension, sickness, accident, occupational health, MDE and (public-sector) family benefits are capped.
- NEVER charge the employer a dependency contribution — the 1.40% is **employee only**.
- NEVER charge a private-sector employer the 1.70% family-benefits contribution — it is **public-sector only**.
- NEVER compute capped-branch contributions on earnings above the ceiling (EUR 13,518.68/month from May 2025; EUR 13,188.96 Jan--Apr 2025).
- NEVER mix the two 2025 parameter sets — use index 944.43 for Jan--Apr 2025 and index 968.04 from May 2025.
- NEVER omit the employer-only funds (accident 0.700%, occupational health 0.14%, MDE by class) on top of employer pension and sickness.
- NEVER apply the 2026 pension rate (8.05%/party) to 2025 — that change takes effect 1 January 2026 and is out of scope.
- NEVER forget the solidarity surcharge (7%, or 9% above EUR 150,000 / 300,000) on top of the income tax due.
- NEVER miss the wage-withholding remittance (by the 10th of the following month via MyGuichet.lu), the CCSS payment (within 10 days of the statement), the CCSS entry declaration (within 8 days of hiring) or the annual salary statement (before 1 March) — penalties apply.
- NEVER run a self-employed / non-salaried person through employer payroll — trigger R-LU-P-2.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Luxembourg reviewer (expert-comptable / fiduciaire).
