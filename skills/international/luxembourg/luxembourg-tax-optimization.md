## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Grand Duchy of Luxembourg |
| Currency | EUR |
| Headline levers | Self-employed vs SARL/SARL-S; third-pillar pension deduction; interest & insurance deductions |
| Personal income tax | Progressive, 23 brackets, **0%–42%** |
| Corporate tax (2025) | CIT **14%** (base < €175,000) / **16%** (base > €200,000), plus municipal business tax + solidarity surtax |
| SARL allowance | Automatic **€17,500** business allowance |
| Self-employed pension (CNAP) | **24%** of net income, payable in full by the self-employed person |
| Anti-avoidance | Substance; reasonable remuneration; ATAD GAAR |

> **Lever:** beyond a certain income, a **SARL/SARL-S** separates company income (CIT ~14–16%) from personal income (PIT up to 42%), letting you retain/reinvest at the lower corporate rate and control extraction. Below that, the self-employed route with full use of personal deductions is simpler.

## Section 2 -- Self-Employed vs SARL / SARL-S

| Route | Treatment | Best when |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-employed (indépendant)** | Net profit taxed on the progressive 0–42% scale; CNAP 24%; full personal deductions | Lower income, low complexity |
| **SARL-S / SARL** | CIT 14–16% on profit; **automatic €17,500 allowance**; owner takes salary (deductible) + dividends; profit can be retained at the corporate rate | Higher income, reinvesting, liability/credibility |

**AUDIT FLASH POINT** — an owner-manager must take a **reasonable salary** for work performed; converting all profit into low-taxed distributions without substance is challengeable.

## Section 3 -- Deductions Most People Miss

| Deduction | Detail |
|---|---|
| Business expenses | Genuine costs of running the activity (self-employed) / company (SARL). |
| Mortgage interest (own home) | Deductible — **uncapped** for the year the rental value is fixed + the following year; then ceilings €4,000 / €3,000 / €2,000. |
| Personal-loan & insurance interest/premiums | Life/health/accident/liability premiums + personal-loan interest deductible up to **€672** (+ same per spouse and per dependent child). |
| SARL €17,500 allowance | Automatic, no formalities. |

---

## Section 4 -- Pension & Retirement Reliefs

| Relief | Detail |
|---|---|
| Third-pillar private pension | Premiums deductible up to **€3,200** (**€4,500 from tax year 2026**). |
| Employer pension scheme (employee) | Deductible up to **€1,200/yr**. |
| CNAP (self-employed) | 24% of net income — mandatory, but full deductibility/relief mechanics should be confirmed. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm CNAP deductibility for the self-employed.]** |

---

## Section 5 -- Personal Abatements

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Joint professional abatement | €4,500 where both jointly-taxed spouses/partners have professional income. |
| Tax classes | Class 1 / 1a / 2 affect the rate — confirm the correct class (married/partnered/with children). |
| Extra-professional / commuter / other abatements | Several standard abatements apply — confirm eligibility. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current abatement amounts.]** |

---

## Section 6 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Reasonable salary:** owner-managers must be paid a market salary; all-dividend extraction without substance is challengeable.
- **Substance:** a SARL must carry on genuine business and be managed in Luxembourg.
- ATAD GAAR applies to arrangements whose main purpose is a tax advantage.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER advise an active SARL owner to take no salary and only distributions.
- NEVER present incorporation purely as a tax play without the substance/reasonable-salary warning.
- NEVER contradict the rates in `luxembourg-income-tax.md` / `luxembourg-social-contributions.md` (note: 2026 pension contribution is 8.5% each side).
- NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Luxembourg tax adviser.
