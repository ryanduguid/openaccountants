# Ecuador Income Tax -- Personas Naturales / Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 (research-verified). NOT yet accountant-verified.** The 2026 PIT table is read verbatim from the official SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC25-00000043 PDF (high confidence). The 2025 table and several social-security / gastos-personales figures rely on Big-4 (PwC) and reputable Ecuadorian sources (JEZL, Russell Bedford, HLB Ecuador) rather than line-by-line re-extraction of the original SRI resolutions; those points carry inline `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` markers. A licensed Ecuadorian contador/CPA must sign off before filing.

### Tax Rate Brackets -- General Regime (Personas Naturales)

PIT is progressive 0%-37% on **net taxable income** (LRTI art. 36). The table is indexed annually to the urban CPI (INEC) at 30 November; the 2026 indexation was 1.0534712934405% (SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC25-00000043).

**2025 (fiscal year filed March 2026)** -- SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC24-00000041, applies from 2025-01-01; exempt base USD 12,081. Source: SRI; JEZL Auditores; PwC. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2025 bracket figures line-by-line against the original 2024 SRI resolution PDF, which was binary-encoded.]`

| Net taxable income (USD) | Tax on base (USD) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 12,081 | 0 | 0% | USD 0 |
| 12,081 -- 15,387 | 0 | 5% | USD 165 |
| 15,387 -- 19,978 | 165 | 10% | USD 624 |
| 19,978 -- 26,422 | 624 | 12% | USD 1,398 |
| 26,422 -- 34,770 | 1,398 | 15% | USD 2,650 |
| 34,770 -- 46,089 | 2,650 | 20% | USD 4,914 |
| 46,089 -- 61,359 | 4,914 | 25% | USD 8,731 |
| 61,359 -- 81,817 | 8,731 | 30% | USD 14,869 |
| 81,817 -- 108,810 | 14,869 | 35% | USD 24,316 |
| 108,810 + | 24,316 | 37% | -- |

**2026 (applies from 2026-01-01)** -- SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC25-00000043 (signed 2025-12-29); exempt base USD 12,208; confirmed verbatim from the official SRI PDF.

| Net taxable income (USD) | Tax on base (USD) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 12,208 | 0 | 0% | USD 0 |
| 12,208 -- 15,549 | 0 | 5% | USD 167 |
| 15,549 -- 20,188 | 167 | 10% | USD 631 |
| 20,188 -- 26,700 | 631 | 12% | USD 1,412 |
| 26,700 -- 35,136 | 1,412 | 15% | USD 2,678 |
| 35,136 -- 46,575 | 2,678 | 20% | USD 4,965 |
| 46,575 -- 62,005 | 4,965 | 25% | USD 8,823 |
| 62,005 -- 82,679 | 8,823 | 30% | USD 15,025 |
| 82,679 -- 109,956 | 15,025 | 35% | USD 24,572 |
| 109,956 + | 24,572 | 37% | -- |

**How to compute tax in any bracket:** tax = (tax on base) + (net taxable income − bracket floor) × marginal rate. Then subtract the personal-expense rebate (see Section 1, Personal-Expense Rebate). Never compute tax directly in prose -- pass the chargeable figure to the deterministic engine.

**Non-residents:** flat **25%** on Ecuadorian-source income, withheld at source, with NO brackets and NO personal allowance (PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries -- Ecuador Individual).

### IESS Social Security Contributions

Base = *materia gravada* (salary + habitual remuneration: commissions, overtime, etc.). Floor = 1 SBU. **No upper ceiling.** Source: IESS Tasas de Aportación (as reported by EcuadorLegalOnline; misalario.ec). `[RESEARCH GAP — the IESS official PDF was binary/unreadable; the 9.45% / 11.15% / 20.50% rates rely on EcuadorLegalOnline and misalario.ec, not the IESS document itself; fund-by-fund split (IVM/salud/riesgos/cesantía) not obtained — reviewer to confirm.]`

**Private-sector dependent worker (employee with labour relationship):**

| Contribution | Payer | Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|---|
| Aporte personal (employee) | Employee | 9.45% | materia gravada, floor 1 SBU, no ceiling |
| Aporte patronal (employer) | Employer | 11.15% | same materia gravada |
| **Total (private-sector dependent)** | **Employee + Employer** | **20.60%** | **(9.45% + 11.15%)** |

**Other IESS situations:**

| Situation | Payer | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Afiliado voluntario / independiente (self-employed, no labour relationship) | Self (full amount) | 20.50% | On declared income, floor 1 SBU; relevant for self-employed not under dependency |
| Public sector (reference only) | Worker 11.45% / State 9.15% | -- | Split differs from private sector `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]` |
| Fondos de Reserva (Reserve Fund) | Employer | 8.33% | Paid from the worker's 13th month of continuous service (= one month's pay / 12); monthly or accumulated at IESS at the worker's choice (Código del Trabajo) |

### Key Payroll / Benefit Items

| Item | 2025 | 2026 | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salario Básico Unificado (SBU / minimum wage) | USD 470.00/month | USD 482.00/month (Acuerdo Ministerial MDT-2025-195, from 2026-01-01) | Ministerio del Trabajo; NMS Law; CorralRosales |
| Décimo Tercer Sueldo (13th salary / Christmas bonus) | = 1/12 of total remuneration earned 1 Dec–30 Nov; paid by 24 Dec | same | EXEMPT from PIT; NOT part of IESS base (Código del Trabajo; PwC) |
| Décimo Cuarto Sueldo (14th salary / education bonus) | = 1 SBU (USD 470) | = 1 SBU (USD 482) | EXEMPT from PIT; paid by 15 Mar (Costa/Insular) or 15 Aug (Sierra/Amazonía) (Código del Trabajo) |
| IESS remittance deadline | within 15 days following the worked month | same | EcuadorLegalOnline |

### Personal-Expense Rebate (Rebaja por Gastos Personales)

**rebate = 18% × the lesser of (a) declared documented personal expenses, or (b) the canasta cap** (SRI; Russell Bedford; HLB Ecuador; Buró Tributario).

| Dependents | Canasta multiplier | 2025 cap (canasta USD 798.31) | 2026 cap (canasta USD 821.80) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 (base case) | 7 canastas | ≈ USD 5,588.17 → max rebate ≈ USD 1,005.87 | ≈ USD 5,752.60 → max rebate ≈ USD 1,035.47 |
| 1 | 9 canastas | `[RESEARCH GAP — per-dependent USD cap for 2025 not extracted line-by-line]` | ≈ USD 7,396.20 (9 × 821.80) |
| 2 | 11 canastas | `[RESEARCH GAP]` | ≈ USD 9,039.80 |
| 3 | 14 canastas | `[RESEARCH GAP]` | ≈ USD 11,505.20 |
| 4 | 17 canastas | `[RESEARCH GAP]` | ≈ USD 13,970.60 |
| 5+ | 20 canastas | `[RESEARCH GAP]` | ≈ USD 16,436.00 |

The canasta-multiplier structure (7/9/11/14/17/20) is sourced from HLB Ecuador for 2026; the same structure applies in 2025 with canasta USD 798.31 (Russell Bedford), but the exact per-dependent USD caps for 2025 were not extracted from an SRI boletín. Canasta básica = USD 798.31 (Jan 2025) and USD 821.80 (Jan 2026).

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown regime (general vs RIMPE) | General-regime art. 36 table -- apply RIMPE ONLY if the individual is registered in RIMPE and within the revenue band (≤ USD 300,000) |
| Unknown residency | Treat as fiscally resident (worldwide income) ONLY if 183-day test met; otherwise flat 25% on Ecuadorian-source income |
| Unknown dependents for rebate | No-dependents case (7 canastas) |
| Unknown personal-expense documentation | Rebate = 18% of declared expenses (lesser value); 0 if no documented expenses |
| 13th / 14th salaries | EXCLUDE from taxable income and from the IESS base |
| Self-employed not under labour dependency | Model IESS as the 20.50% voluntary/independent rate on declared income (min 1 SBU), NOT the 9.45/11.15 split |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown year | Use 2025 (current filing year, return due March 2026) |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text), plus confirmation of (a) residency (resident vs non-resident / 183-day test), (b) regime (general vs RIMPE), and (c) number of dependents (for the gastos-personales rebate).

**Recommended** -- all facturas (sales and purchase invoices with RUC), IESS contribution / planilla records, prior-year Formulario 102, RUC registration showing regime, RIMPE category (Negocio Popular vs Emprendedor) if applicable.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, Anexo de Gastos Personales (APS) detail with documented facturas by category (vivienda, salud, educación, alimentación, vestimenta, turismo), 13th/14th salary records, withholding certificates (comprobantes de retención).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without facturas = proceed with reviewer warning: "This Formulario 102 was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that every deductible expense and every gasto personal claimed is supported by a valid factura with RUC, and that residency and regime are correctly determined."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-EC-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines the entire computation: residents are taxed on worldwide income at the progressive 0%-37% table; non-residents pay a flat 25% on Ecuadorian-source income with no allowance. This skill cannot compute tax without resolving the 183-day test. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-EC-2 -- Companies / partnerships / sociedades.** "This skill covers natural persons (personas naturales) and self-employed individuals only. Sociedades, companies, and other legal entities file under the corporate regime (Impuesto a la Renta de Sociedades). Escalate to a licensed Ecuadorian contador."

**R-EC-3 -- Cross-border / treaty cases.** "Worldwide income, foreign tax credits, double-tax treaties, and CAN Decision 578 (Andean Community) require specialised analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a licensed Ecuadorian contador."

**R-EC-4 -- Capital gains / property disposals / herencias.** "Gains on shares or real property, inheritance/gift tax, and asset disposals require separate analysis. Escalate to a licensed Ecuadorian contador."

**R-EC-5 -- Arrears / SRI enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to SRI enforcement. Interest on mora is variable (Banco Central 90-day reference rate, set quarterly) and a 20% recargo applies where the SRI detects the omission. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-EC-6 -- IVA return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (Formulario 102/102A) only. For Ecuador IVA, use the ecuador-iva skill."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank-statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement (Spanish terms common in Ecuadorian statements). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Créditos on Bank Statement)

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All amounts in USD (Ecuador is dollarized). Tax figures use the 2025 general-regime table unless noted.

### Example 1 -- Self-Employed Professional Fee (Income)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; PICHINCHA ; TRANSFERENCIA RECIBIDA ; ACME CIA LTDA ; HONORARIOS FACTURA 001-001-000234 ; +1,150.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Professional fee. If the professional is IVA-registered, USD 1,150 includes 15% IVA → net = USD 1,000 (renta gravada); USD 150 is IVA collected (a liability to the SRI, excluded from income). If not IVA-registered, the full USD 1,150 is income.

**Classification:** Renta gravada = USD 1,000 (IVA-registered) or USD 1,150 (not registered). IVA USD 150 excluded.

### Example 2 -- Self-Employed Annual PIT with Rebate (2025)

**Input:** Resident professional, net taxable income (after deductible business costs and IESS) = USD 30,000. Documented personal expenses ≥ the cap, no dependents.

**Reasoning:**
- USD 30,000 falls in the 26,422–34,770 bracket (15%).
- Tax = 1,398 + (30,000 − 26,422) × 15% = 1,398 + 3,578 × 0.15 = 1,398 + 536.70 = **USD 1,934.70**.
- Personal-expense rebate (no dependents): 18% × min(declared expenses, 7 canastas = 5,588.17) = 5,588.17 × 0.18 = **USD 1,005.87**.
- Tax after rebate = 1,934.70 − 1,005.87 = **USD 928.83**.

**Classification:** Impuesto causado USD 1,934.70; rebaja USD 1,005.87; tax due USD 928.83 (before withholding credits).

### Example 3 -- Employee Monthly IESS Withholding (2025)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; GUAYAQUIL ; ROL DE PAGOS ; EMPLEADOR XYZ SA ; SUELDO ABRIL ; +1,358.25 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Gross monthly salary USD 1,500. Employee IESS aporte personal = 9.45% × 1,500 = USD 141.75. Net deposited to the worker = 1,500 − 141.75 = USD 1,358.25 (before any PIT withholding). The 13th/14th salaries are paid separately and are exempt; they are NOT part of the IESS base.

**Classification:** IESS employee USD 141.75; taxable employment base (this month) USD 1,358.25 before PIT withholding.

### Example 4 -- Non-Resident Ecuadorian-Source Fee

**Input line:**
`10/06/2025 ; PICHINCHA ; TRANSFERENCIA ; CLIENTE EC ; SERVICIOS PRESTADOS EN ECUADOR ; +10,000.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Payee is a non-resident (183-day test NOT met). Ecuadorian-source income is taxed at a flat 25% withheld at source, with no brackets and no personal allowance (PwC). Tax = 10,000 × 25% = USD 2,500.

**Classification:** Flat 25% non-resident withholding = USD 2,500. No rebate, no table.

### Example 5 -- RIMPE Negocio Popular (Small Self-Employed)

**Input:** Resident natural person, gross annual revenue USD 18,000, registered in RIMPE as Negocio Popular.

**Reasoning:**
Negocio Popular ceiling is gross annual income ≤ USD 20,000 (SRI RIMPE; JEZL). Negocios Populares pay a fixed-fee table (USD 0 / 5 / 15 / 35 / 60 across revenue bands), not the progressive PIT table. `[RESEARCH GAP — the exact band thresholds mapping revenue to each fixed fee were not extracted from the SRI RIMPE resolution; reviewer to confirm which fixed fee applies to USD 18,000.]` RIMPE income tax is declared in May of the following year (SRI Boletín NAC-COM-25-0020).

**Classification:** RIMPE Negocio Popular fixed fee (USD 0/5/15/35/60) -- exact figure pending reviewer confirmation of the band. NOT the art. 36 table.

### Example 6 -- IESS for Self-Employed Voluntary Affiliate

**Input line:**
`05/02/2025 ; PRODUBANCO ; DEBITO ; IESS ; APORTE VOLUNTARIO ENERO ; -96.35 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Self-employed individual not under labour dependency is a voluntary/independent IESS affiliate at 20.50% on declared income, minimum 1 SBU (USD 470 in 2025), paid entirely by the individual. On the SBU floor: 470 × 20.50% = USD 96.35/month.

**Classification:** IESS voluntary contribution USD 96.35 (on SBU floor). Deductible from the self-employed's income base, not a business expense line.

### Example 7 -- Own-Account Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; PICHINCHA ; TRANSFERENCIA ENTRE CUENTAS PROPIAS ; AHORRO ; ; -2,000.00 ; USD`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the taxpayer's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Progressive PIT, Exempt Base and Filing Obligation

PIT is progressive 0%-37% on net taxable income (LRTI art. 36). The 2025 exempt base is USD 12,081 (SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC24-00000041); 2026 is USD 12,208 with the top 37% bracket starting at USD 109,956 (SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC25-00000043). **Filing obligation:** natural persons with gross income above the exempt base (USD 12,081 for 2025, ≈ USD 1,006.75/month) must file the annual return EVEN IF the rebate reduces tax to zero (SRI; Primicias).

### 5.2 Taxable Employment Income

Taxable employment income = total labour compensation NET of employee IESS contributions (9.45%), and EXCLUDING the 13th (Christmas) and 14th (education) salaries, which are exempt (LRTI; Código del Trabajo; PwC). Employers compute monthly PIT withholding on projected annual taxable income (salary net of IESS, excluding 13th/14th) using the art. 36 table, less the projected personal-expense rebate, reconciled annually (PwC; Reglamento LRTI).

### 5.3 Personal-Expense Rebate (Rebaja por Gastos Personales)

rebate = 18% × the lesser of (a) declared documented personal expenses, or (b) the canasta cap. Cap = 7 canastas with no dependents, scaling to 9/11/14/17/20 canastas for 1/2/3/4/5+ dependents. Canasta básica = USD 798.31 (Jan 2025) and USD 821.80 (Jan 2026). All gastos personales must be backed by facturas with the taxpayer's RUC/cédula (SRI; Russell Bedford; HLB Ecuador). See Section 1 for the full multiplier table and `[RESEARCH GAP]` markers on the 2025 per-dependent caps.

### 5.4 Residency and Worldwide Income

Tax residency triggers at **183 days** (consecutive or not) in a fiscal year, OR 183+ days over 12 months spanning two fiscal periods (SRI; LRTI art. 4.1; Russell Bedford). Residents are taxed on worldwide income with a foreign tax credit (pay the Ecuadorian excess if Ecuador's rate is higher). Non-residents pay only on Ecuadorian-source income at a flat 25% withheld at source.

### 5.5 IESS Contributions

| Worker type | Employee | Employer | Total | Base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Private-sector dependent | 9.45% | 11.15% | **20.60%** | materia gravada, floor 1 SBU, no ceiling |
| Self-employed voluntary/independent | 20.50% (self) | -- | **20.50%** | declared income, floor 1 SBU |

Employer must also pay **Fondos de Reserva at 8.33%** of remuneration from the worker's 13th month of continuous service (Código del Trabajo). IESS contributions are remitted within 15 days following the worked month (EcuadorLegalOnline). `[RESEARCH GAP — IESS official PDF unreadable; rates per EcuadorLegalOnline / misalario.ec.]`

### 5.6 13th and 14th Salaries

- **Décimo Tercer Sueldo** = 1/12 of total remuneration earned 1 Dec–30 Nov; paid by 24 Dec. EXEMPT from PIT; NOT in IESS base.
- **Décimo Cuarto Sueldo** = 1 SBU (USD 470 in 2025; USD 482 in 2026); paid by 15 Mar (Costa/Insular) or 15 Aug (Sierra/Amazonía). EXEMPT from PIT.

(Código del Trabajo; PwC; EcuadorLegalOnline.)

### 5.7 Non-Deductible Expenses

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Fines, penalties, interés por mora | Public policy |
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal consumption | Not a business expense |
| Personal expenses (except via the gastos-personales rebate) | Private living costs feed the rebate, not business profit |

### 5.8 RIMPE Simplified Regime (Small Self-Employed)

| RIMPE category | Revenue band (gross annual) | Tax treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Negocio Popular | ≤ USD 20,000 | Fixed-fee table: USD 0 / 5 / 15 / 35 / 60 across bands `[RESEARCH GAP — exact band thresholds to confirm]` |
| Emprendedor | USD 20,000.01 – 300,000 | 0%-2% marginal on gross income |

RIMPE income tax is declared in **May** of the following year (e.g. 2025 RIMPE return due May 2026), by ninth digit (SRI RIMPE; JEZL; Bloomberg Línea; Primicias). Apply RIMPE ONLY if the taxpayer is registered in RIMPE and within the band.

### 5.9 IVA Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| IVA collected on sales (registered) | NOT income -- exclude from renta gravada |
| Input IVA recovered (crédito tributario) | NOT an expense -- exclude |
| Input IVA not recoverable | IS a cost -- include gross |

`[RESEARCH GAP — current IVA standard rate is 15%; confirm in the ecuador-iva skill before applying to net-of-IVA extractions.]`

### 5.10 Filing Deadlines and Penalties

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Formulario 102/102A (annual PIT) | March of the following year, staggered by ninth digit of cédula/RUC (see Section 6) |
| Anexo de Gastos Personales (APS) | February of the following year, when personal expenses exceed 50% of the exempt base |
| RIMPE income tax | May of the following year |
| Late-filing fine (tax due) | 3% of tax due per month or fraction, capped at 100% of the tax (LRTI art. 100) |
| Late-filing fine (no tax due but income exists) | 0.1% per month/fraction of gross income / sales, with statutory cap (LRTI art. 100) |
| Interest on overdue tax (interés por mora) | Banco Central 90-day reference rate, set quarterly; 1.3× that rate where SRI notifies non-filing before voluntary correction (Código Tributario art. 21) `[RESEARCH GAP — variable rate, no fixed %]` |
| Recargo on omitted tax detected by SRI | 20% of the omitted tax, in addition to fine and interest (Código Tributario) |
| Failure to file Anexo de Gastos Personales | Sanción pecuniaria per SRI sanctions schedule (SRI Preguntas frecuentes sanciones) |

## Section 7 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 7.1 Home Office Apportionment

- For a self-employed person working from home, apportion electricity, water, internet, rent to the business-use proportion.
- Must have facturas with RUC.

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the apportionment basis.

### 7.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 7.4 Gastos Personales Documentation and Dependents

- The rebate depends on documented facturas by category and on the number of dependents (drives the canasta multiplier).
- Flag for reviewer to confirm dependents and that each factura carries the taxpayer's RUC/cédula and falls in an allowed category. `[RESEARCH GAP — 2025 per-dependent caps to confirm.]`

### 7.5 Regime Choice (General vs RIMPE)

- Confirm RUC registration and revenue band. RIMPE is mandatory/elective per the taxpayer's registration; do not assume.
- Flag for reviewer where revenue is near the USD 20,000 (Negocio Popular) or USD 300,000 (Emprendedor) thresholds.

### 7.6 Foreign Income and Treaty Relief (Residents)

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Self-employed, mid-range income, full rebate (2025).**
Input: Resident, net taxable income USD 30,000, no dependents, documented personal expenses ≥ cap.
Expected: Impuesto causado = 1,398 + (30,000 − 26,422) × 15% = USD 1,934.70. Rebate = 5,588.17 × 18% = USD 1,005.87. Tax due = USD 928.83.

**Test 2 -- Income at the exempt base (2025).**
Input: Resident, net taxable income USD 12,081.
Expected: USD 0 tax (top of the 0% band). Filing still REQUIRED because gross income reaches the threshold.

**Test 3 -- Top bracket entry (2026).**
Input: Resident, net taxable income USD 109,956.
Expected: Cumulative tax = USD 24,572 at the start of the 37% band (next dollar taxed at 37%).

**Test 4 -- Non-resident flat 25%.**
Input: Non-resident, Ecuadorian-source income USD 10,000.
Expected: Tax = 10,000 × 25% = USD 2,500. No table, no rebate.

**Test 5 -- Employee monthly IESS (2025).**
Input: Gross monthly salary USD 1,500, private-sector dependent worker.
Expected: Employee IESS = 1,500 × 9.45% = USD 141.75; employer IESS = 1,500 × 11.15% = USD 167.25; total IESS = USD 309.00 (20.60%).

**Test 6 -- Self-employed voluntary IESS on SBU floor (2025).**
Input: Voluntary/independent affiliate at the SBU floor (USD 470).
Expected: Monthly contribution = 470 × 20.50% = USD 96.35.

**Test 7 -- RIMPE band check.**
Input: Resident, gross annual revenue USD 250,000.
Expected: Within the Emprendedor band (USD 20,000.01–300,000); taxed 0%-2% marginal on gross under RIMPE if registered -- NOT the art. 36 table.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the progressive table without confirming residency -- non-residents pay a flat 25% with no allowance
- NEVER compute the impuesto causado in prose -- pass the base imponible to the deterministic engine
- NEVER include the 13th or 14th salary in taxable income or in the IESS base
- NEVER apply the 9.45/11.15 split to a self-employed person not under labour dependency -- use 20.50% voluntary
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, interés por mora, or income tax itself as a deduction
- NEVER include IVA collected on sales in renta gravada for IVA-registered taxpayers
- NEVER claim a gasto personal or business deduction without a factura carrying the taxpayer's RUC/cédula
- NEVER exceed the canasta cap on the personal-expense rebate -- it is 18% of the LESSER value
- NEVER apply RIMPE unless the taxpayer is registered in RIMPE and within the revenue band
- NEVER present a figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP]` as confirmed -- escalate to the reviewer
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
