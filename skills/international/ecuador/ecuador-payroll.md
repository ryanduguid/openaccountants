### Two facts that govern Ecuador payroll

> 1. **IESS personal contribution (9.45%) is deducted before computing income-tax withholding**, and income tax uses an **annual projection** (not a monthly bracket lookup).
> 2. **Décimo tercero, décimo cuarto and fondos de reserva are EXEMPT** from both IESS contributions and income tax — never include them in the IESS base or the IR projection.

---

## Section 2 -- Social Security (IESS)

IESS contributions are computed on the *materia gravada* (salary + habitual remuneration: commissions, overtime, etc.). **Floor = 1 SBU. No upper ceiling.**

| Contribution | Rate (private sector) |
|---|---|
| Aporte personal (employee) | 9.45% |
| Aporte patronal (employer) | 11.15% |
| Combined reference | 20.60% |

*Source: IESS Tasas de Aportación (as reported by EcuadorLegalOnline; misalario.ec).* **[RESEARCH GAP — the IESS official rate PDF was not machine-readable; the 9.45% / 11.15% rates and the fund-by-fund split (IVM / salud / riesgos / cesantía) rely on secondary sources — reviewer to confirm against the IESS document.]**

---

## Section 3 -- Income Tax Withholding (Retención en relación de dependencia)

Ecuador withholds via an **annual projection**, not a monthly bracket lookup:

1. Project annual taxable income = (monthly salary × 12) + projected taxable extras − annual IESS personal (9.45%). Exclude décimos and fondos de reserva (exempt).
2. Subtract allowable items and apply the **rebaja por gastos personales** (personal-expense tax *credit*, based on family burdens / cargas familiares).
3. Apply the **annual IR table** below to get annual tax.
4. Monthly withholding = annual tax ÷ 12 (re-projected if pay changes).

### Annual IR table — 2025 (LRTI art. 36; indexed annually to urban CPI)

| Taxable income from (USD) | up to (USD) | Tax on base | % on excess |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | 12,081 | 0 | 0% |
| 12,081 | 15,387 | 0 | 5% |
| 15,387 | 19,978 | 165 | 10% |
| 19,978 | 26,422 | 624 | 12% |
| 26,422 | 34,770 | 1,398 | 15% |
| 34,770 | 46,089 | 2,650 | 20% |
| 46,089 | 61,359 | 4,914 | 25% |
| 61,359 | 81,817 | 8,731 | 30% |
| 81,817 | 108,810 | 14,869 | 35% |
| 108,810 | + | 24,316 | 37% |

**2026:** exempt base rises to USD 12,208 (SRI Resolution NAC-DGERCGC25-00000043). Use the 2026 table from `ecuador-income-tax.md` for 2026 payrolls. Non-residents: flat **25%**, no brackets, no allowance.

> The personal-expense rebate (rebaja) reduces the computed tax and is reported by the employee on Form **SRI-GP**. The worked examples below show tax **before** the rebate; the rebate lowers the withholding. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to apply the current gastos-personales rebate cap by number of cargas familiares.]**

## Section 4 -- Mandatory Bonuses & Reserve Fund

| Benefit | Amount | Timing | IESS / IR? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Décimo tercero (13th salary) | 1/12 of remuneration earned 1 Dec–30 Nov | Paid by 24 December (or monthly if elected) | Exempt from both |
| Décimo cuarto (14th salary) | 1 SBU (USD 470 in 2025) | Sierra/Amazonía by 15 Aug; Costa/Insular by 15 Mar | Exempt from both |
| Fondos de reserva | 8.33% of remuneration | From the 13th month of employment; paid monthly to IESS or accrued | Exempt from both |

(Código del Trabajo; IESS) Do NOT add these to the IESS base or to the IR projection.

## Section 5 -- Worked Examples (gross-to-net, monthly)

### Example 1 — SBU earner (gross USD 470)

- IESS personal: 9.45% × 470 = **USD 44.42**
- IR projection: (470 × 12) − (44.42 × 12) = 5,640 − 533 = 5,107 < 12,081 → **0% → USD 0.00/month**
- **Net pay = 470 − 44.42 = USD 425.58** (plus décimo tercero, décimo cuarto and fondos de reserva accruing separately)

### Example 2 — Mid salary (gross USD 1,000)

- IESS personal: 9.45% × 1,000 = **USD 94.50**
- IR projection: (1,000 × 12) − (94.50 × 12) = 12,000 − 1,134 = 10,866 < 12,081 → **0% → USD 0.00/month**
- **Net pay = 1,000 − 94.50 = USD 905.50**

### Example 3 — Higher earner (gross USD 2,500)

- IESS personal: 9.45% × 2,500 = **USD 236.25**
- IR projection: (2,500 × 12) − (236.25 × 12) = 30,000 − 2,835 = **27,165**; falls in the 26,422–34,770 band → annual tax = 1,398 + 15% × (27,165 − 26,422) = 1,398 + 111.45 = **USD 1,509.45** (before the gastos-personales rebate)
- Monthly withholding = 1,509.45 ÷ 12 = **USD 125.79** (before rebate; the rebate lowers it)
- **Net pay (before rebate) = 2,500 − 236.25 − 125.79 = USD 2,137.96**
- Employer cost: IESS patronal 11.15% × 2,500 = USD 278.75 (plus accruals for décimos and fondos de reserva)

## Section 6 -- Payslip (Rol de Pagos)

The rol de pagos must show: gross salary and habitual remuneration, IESS aporte personal (9.45%), IR retención, any other authorised deductions, net pay, and the employer-side IESS aporte patronal and benefit accruals. Employees access contribution history via the IESS portal.

## Section 7 -- Filing & Payment Obligations

| Obligation | Channel | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| IESS planilla (aportes) | IESS online system | Within 15 days of month-end |
| IR retención en relación de dependencia | SRI — monthly Formulario 103 | Per the 9th-digit (noveno dígito) calendar |
| Annual employee withholding certificate | SRI Form 107 to each employee | By end of January (following year) |
| Décimo tercero / décimo cuarto reports | Ministerio del Trabajo (SUT) | After each payment deadline |

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current form numbers and the noveno-dígito due dates.]**

## Section 8 -- Common Payroll Patterns

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| ROL DE PAGOS, SUELDO, NÓMINA, ABONO SUELDO | Net salary disbursement |
| IESS, APORTE IESS, PLANILLA IESS | IESS remittance (personal + patronal) |
| SRI, RETENCIÓN RENTA, FORM 103 | IR withholding to the SRI |
| DÉCIMO TERCERO, DÉCIMO CUARTO | Mandatory 13th / 14th salaries (exempt) |
| FONDOS DE RESERVA | 8.33% reserve fund (exempt) |

---

## Section 9 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (this skill) | **ecuador-payroll.md** |
| Self-employed / individual income tax (Formulario 102/102A, RIMPE, gastos personales) | ecuador-income-tax.md |
| Employer & self-employed IESS rates | ecuador-social-contributions.md |
| Ecuador IVA (15%) | ecuador-iva (consumption tax) |

**Handoff:** the SRI Form 107 (annual withholding certificate) feeds the employee's personal income-tax return (Form 102A) where they have other income or claim the gastos-personales rebate.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER use a monthly IR bracket lookup — Ecuador withholds by ANNUAL projection (project, apply the annual table, divide by 12).
- NEVER include décimo tercero, décimo cuarto, or fondos de reserva in the IESS base or the IR projection — all three are exempt.
- NEVER cap IESS — there is no upper salary ceiling (floor is 1 SBU).
- NEVER ignore the gastos-personales rebate — it reduces the employee's withholding.
- NEVER apply IESS at less than 1 SBU for a full-time worker.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Ecuadorian contador.
