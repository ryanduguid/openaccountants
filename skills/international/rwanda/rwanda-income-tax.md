### PAYE / PIT Rate Brackets — Monthly (2023 onward, permanent schedule)

**Same rates apply to residents and non-residents.** [RRA PIT page; PwC, individual]

| Monthly taxable income (RWF) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (RWF) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 60,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 60,001 -- 100,000 | 10% | 4,000 |
| 100,001 -- 200,000 | 20% | 24,000 |
| 200,001+ | 30% | -- |

*Cumulative check: 60k–100k = 40,000 × 10% = 4,000. 100k–200k = 100,000 × 20% = 20,000; cumulative 24,000.* [RRA new-rates guide]

### PAYE / PIT Rate Brackets — Annual equivalent

| Annual taxable income (RWF) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (RWF) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 720,000 | 0% | 0 |
| 720,001 -- 1,200,000 | 10% | 48,000 |
| 1,200,001 -- 2,400,000 | 20% | 288,000 |
| 2,400,001+ | 30% | -- |

*Cumulative check: 720k–1.2M = 480,000 × 10% = 48,000. 1.2M–2.4M = 1,200,000 × 20% = 240,000; cumulative 288,000. Annual bands = monthly bands × 12 (60k/100k/200k → 720k/1.2M/2.4M).* [RRA PIT page]

**Monthly PAYE = annual tax ÷ 12, rounded up.** [RRA new-rates guide]

> **Superseded schedule warning.** A transitional "Year 1" schedule (0% / 20% / 30%, with the 720k–1.2M band taxed at 20%) existed under Law N° 027/2022 but has been **superseded**. The current correct middle-band rate is **10%**, not 20%. [RRA new-rates guide]

### Special-Category Income Rates

| Category | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Casual labourer | 15% flat, first RWF 60,000/month at 0% | [RRA new-rates guide; Law N° 027/2022] |
| Non-resident (Rwanda-source income) | Same bracket rates as residents | Taxed only on Rwanda-source income [PwC, individual] |
| Capital gains on shares | 10% | [PwC, individual] |
| Corporate Income Tax (if operating via a company) | 28% | Reduced from 30% by the 2022 law [PwC, corporate] |

### Self-Employed Turnover Regimes

| Annual turnover (RWF) | Regime | Tax |
|---|---|---|
| < 2,000,000 | Exempt from registration | No income tax registration required [RRA register page] |
| 2,000,001 -- 12,000,000 | Micro-enterprise flat tax | Fixed annual amount (table in §5.7) [PwC, corporate] |
| 12,000,001 -- 20,000,000 | Small-business lump-sum | 3% of annual turnover [PwC, corporate] |
| > 20,000,000 (or by election) | Real regime (actual taxation) | Progressive PIT on net profit; election irrevocable for 3 years [PwC, corporate] |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residence status | Treat as **resident** worldwide-income basis only if confirmed; otherwise STOP and ask |
| Unknown employment vs self-employment | STOP — PAYE and turnover regimes differ fundamentally |
| Unknown turnover band (self-employed) | Use the band the documented turnover falls into; if turnover unknown, STOP |
| Unknown benefit-in-kind value | Apply statutory valuation (housing 20%, vehicle 10% of employment income) [PwC, sample calc] |
| Unknown business-use % (mixed expense, real regime) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category (real regime) | Not deductible |
| Unknown casual vs regular employment | Treat as regular employee (progressive brackets) unless casual status confirmed |
| Minimum-wage floor | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** — no enforceable national statutory minimum wage exists; do not assume one |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — for an **employee**: monthly gross salary breakdown (basic + housing + transport + other allowances) and confirmation of resident/non-resident status. For a **self-employed individual**: bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text) plus confirmation of annual turnover and chosen/eligible regime.

**Recommended** — payslips, RSSB contribution records, benefits-in-kind details (housing, vehicle), prior-year PIT declaration or RRA assessment, sales/purchase records (self-employed).

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account (real regime), asset register, RSSB statements for all schemes, casual-labour registers, KIFC expert status documentation (if applicable).

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No salary breakdown or no bank statement at all = hard stop. Salary stated as a single gross figure with no allowance split = proceed with reviewer warning: "Benefit-in-kind and RSSB contribution bases depend on the allowance split (housing/transport). This computation assumed [stated assumption]. The reviewer must confirm the allowance breakdown."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-RW-1 — Residence status unknown.** "Residence status affects the scope of taxable income (worldwide for residents vs Rwanda-source only for non-residents). This skill cannot compute tax without it. Please confirm before proceeding." [PwC, individual]

**R-RW-2 — Companies, partnerships, group structures.** "This skill covers individual taxpayers (employees and sole-trader / turnover-regime self-employed). Companies file Corporate Income Tax (28%) separately. Escalate to a Rwanda-licensed practitioner." [PwC, corporate]

**R-RW-3 — KIFC expert exemption.** "New residents (not resident in the prior 5 years) working as experts for Kigali International Financial Centre (KIFC)-licensed entities may be exempt from PIT on foreign-source income for their first 5 years. This requires specialist confirmation of eligibility. Escalate." [PwC; RRA]

**R-RW-4 — Capital gains / share disposals.** "Capital gains on shares are taxed at 10% under separate rules. Out of scope for this PAYE/PIT skill. Escalate." [PwC, individual]

**R-RW-5 — Arrears / RRA enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to RRA enforcement. Administrative fines reach 60% of tax due and late-payment interest accrues monthly (capped at 100% of the tax). Do not advise. Escalate immediately." [RRA penalties notice]

**R-RW-6 — VAT return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (PIT/PAYE) only. Rwanda VAT is standard-rated at 18% with a registration threshold of RWF 20,000,000/year (or RWF 5,000,000/quarter). Use a dedicated VAT skill." [PwC, corporate]

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5. Patterns appear in English, Kinyarwanda, and French because Rwandan bank statements use all three.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits on Bank Statement)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| MUSHAHARA, SALARY, SALAIRE, PAYE NET, EMPLOYER [name] | Employment income | PAYE should already be withheld at source by employer |
| Client name + TRANSFER, DEPOSIT, KWISHYURA, PAIEMENT | Business income (self-employed) | Turnover for regime test; if VAT-registered, extract net (excl. 18% VAT) |
| FEES, HONORARIES, HONORAIRES, CONSULTANCY, AMAFARANGA Y'AKAZI | Business income | Professional fees |
| MOMO PAYOUT, MTN MOMO, AIRTEL MONEY (business inflow) | Business income | Mobile-money inflow — match to invoices |
| STRIPE / PAYPAL / WISE / UPWORK / FIVERR PAYOUT | Business income | Platform payout — net of platform commission |
| RENT RECEIVED, UBUKODE, LOYER | Rental income | Separate income stream — not turnover for the trading regimes |
| INTEREST, INYUNGU, INTÉRÊTS | Investment income | May be subject to withholding tax |
| DIVIDEND, IMIGABANE, DIVIDENDE | Investment income | Subject to withholding tax |
| RRA REFUND, TAX REFUND | EXCLUDE | Refund of prior tax |
| AGRICULTURE, LIVESTOCK, UBUHINZI, UBWOROZI proceeds | Business income — but see exemption | Agriculture/livestock income exempt up to RWF 12,000,000/period; only excess taxed [RRA register page; PwC] |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits) — Deductible under the Real Regime Only

> Deductions are only relevant under the **real regime**. Micro-enterprise (flat) and lump-sum taxpayers pay on turnover and CANNOT deduct expenses.

| INTERNAL TRANSFER, OWN ACCOUNT, BETWEEN ACCOUNTS | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| LOAN REPAYMENT, INGUZANYO, PRÊT | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Monthly PAYE, regular resident employee

**Input line:**
`28/02/2025 ; BK SALARY CREDIT ; EMPLOYER KIGALI TECH LTD ; MUSHAHARA FEB ; +XXX ; RWF`
Stated: monthly taxable employment income = **RWF 350,000** (resident, regular employee).

**Reasoning (monthly brackets):**
- 0 – 60,000 @ 0% = 0
- 60,001 – 100,000: 40,000 × 10% = 4,000
- 100,001 – 200,000: 100,000 × 20% = 20,000
- 200,001 – 350,000: 150,000 × 30% = 45,000
- **Total monthly PAYE = 0 + 4,000 + 20,000 + 45,000 = RWF 69,000** [RRA PIT page]

**Classification:** PAYE withheld = RWF 69,000. Net of tax (before RSSB) = 350,000 − 69,000 = RWF 281,000.

### Example 2 — Annual PIT, self-employed real regime

**Input:** Resident sole trader, **annual net taxable profit = RWF 9,000,000** (real regime, turnover above RWF 20,000,000).

**Reasoning (annual brackets):**
- 0 – 720,000 @ 0% = 0
- 720,001 – 1,200,000: 480,000 × 10% = 48,000
- 1,200,001 – 2,400,000: 1,200,000 × 20% = 240,000
- 2,400,001 – 9,000,000: 6,600,000 × 30% = 1,980,000
- **Total annual PIT = 0 + 48,000 + 240,000 + 1,980,000 = RWF 2,268,000** [RRA PIT page]

**Classification:** PIT due = RWF 2,268,000, declared by 31 March of the following year.

### Example 3 — Micro-enterprise flat tax

**Input:** Self-employed, **annual turnover = RWF 6,500,000** (falls in the 4,000,001 – 7,000,000 band).

**Reasoning:** Micro-enterprise flat-tax regime. Turnover RWF 4,000,001 – 7,000,000 → fixed annual tax of **RWF 120,000**. No expense deductions permitted. [PwC, corporate]

**Classification:** Flat tax = RWF 120,000 for the year.

### Example 4 — Small-business lump-sum tax

**Input:** Self-employed, **annual turnover = RWF 16,000,000** (band 12,000,001 – 20,000,000).

**Reasoning:** Lump-sum regime = 3% of annual turnover. 16,000,000 × 3% = **RWF 480,000**. [PwC, corporate]

**Classification:** Lump-sum tax = RWF 480,000.

### Example 5 — Casual labourer

**Input:** Casual labourer, **monthly income = RWF 150,000**.

**Reasoning:** Casual-labour flat rate of 15%, with the first RWF 60,000/month at 0%.
- First 60,000 @ 0% = 0
- Remaining 90,000 × 15% = 13,500
- **Total = RWF 13,500** [RRA new-rates guide]

**Classification:** Tax withheld = RWF 13,500.

### Example 6 — RSSB pension contribution (2025)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; BK DEBIT ; RSSB PENSION FEB ; ; -XXX ; RWF`
Stated contribution base (basic + housing + transport) = **RWF 400,000/month**.

**Reasoning:** From 1 January 2025 the pension scheme is 6% employee / 6% employer (total 12%), and the base now includes basic + housing + transport allowances. [EY; PwC, other-taxes; Presidential Order N° 086/01]
- Employee 6% × 400,000 = 24,000
- Employer 6% × 400,000 = 24,000
- **Total remitted = RWF 48,000** (24,000 deducted from employee + 24,000 employer)

**Classification:** Employee deduction = RWF 24,000; employer cost = RWF 24,000.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residence and Scope

Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents only on Rwanda-source income. The same bracket rates apply to both. [PwC, individual]

### 5.2 PAYE Computation (Employment Income)

Employers withhold PAYE monthly using the monthly bracket table (Section 1). Monthly PAYE = annual tax ÷ 12, rounded up. PAYE return and remittance are due by the **15th of the following month**. [PwC, tax-administration; RRA new-rates guide]

### 5.3 Benefits in Kind

| Benefit | Statutory valuation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Housing benefit | 20% of total employment income | [PwC, sample calc] |
| Vehicle benefit | 10% of total employment income | [PwC, sample calc] |

Add the valued benefit to taxable employment income before applying the brackets.

### 5.4 Casual Labour

Casual-labourer income is taxed at a flat **15%**, with the first **RWF 60,000/month at 0%**. [RRA new-rates guide; Law N° 027/2022]

### 5.5 KIFC Expert Exemption

New residents (not resident in the prior 5 years) working as experts/professionals for KIFC-licensed entities are exempt from PIT on **foreign-source income for their first 5 years** of residence. Eligibility requires specialist confirmation — see R-RW-3. [PwC; RRA]

### 5.6 Self-Employed Registration

An individual must register for income tax on starting taxable activity, **except** where annual turnover is below **RWF 2,000,000** (exempt from registration). [RRA register page]

### 5.7 Micro-Enterprise Flat Tax (turnover RWF 2,000,001 – 12,000,000)

| Annual turnover (RWF) | Annual flat tax (RWF) |
|---|---|
| 2,000,001 – 4,000,000 | 60,000 |
| 4,000,001 – 7,000,000 | 120,000 |
| 7,000,001 – 10,000,000 | 210,000 |
| 10,000,001 – 12,000,000 | 300,000 |

No expense deductions. [PwC, corporate]

### 5.8 Small-Business Lump-Sum Tax (turnover RWF 12,000,001 – 20,000,000)

Tax = **3% of annual turnover**. No expense deductions. [PwC, corporate]

### 5.9 Real Regime (turnover > RWF 20,000,000, or by election)

Actual taxation on net profit using the annual progressive brackets, with proper accounting and deductible expenses. Election into the real regime is **irrevocable for 3 years**. [PwC, corporate]

### 5.10 Agriculture / Livestock Exemption

Income/turnover from agricultural and livestock activities is exempt up to **RWF 12,000,000** per tax period; only the excess is taxable. [RRA register page; PwC, corporate]

### 5.11 RSSB Social-Security Contributions (2025)

| Scheme | Employee | Employer | Total | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension (from 1 Jan 2025) | 6% | 6% | 12% | Basic + housing + transport allowances | [EY; PwC; Presidential Order N° 086/01] |
| Occupational hazards | 0% | 2% | 2% | Gross pay | [PwC, other-taxes] |
| Maternity leave | 0.3% | 0.3% | 0.6% | Excludes transport allowance | [PwC, other-taxes] |
| Medical (RSSB / formerly RAMA) | 7.5% | 7.5% | 15% | Basic salary (public sector / opt-in, min. 7 employees) | [RRA medical notice] |
| CBHI / Mutuelle | 0.5% | 0% | 0.5% | Net salary (after PAYE and RSSB deductions) | [PwC, other-taxes] |

*Column checks — Pension: 6 + 6 = 12 ✓. Occupational: 0 + 2 = 2 ✓. Maternity: 0.3 + 0.3 = 0.6 ✓. Medical: 7.5 + 7.5 = 15 ✓. CBHI: 0.5 + 0 = 0.5 ✓.*

**Pension phasing:** doubled from the previous 6% total (3%/3%) to 12% (6%/6%) on 1 Jan 2025. From January 2027, +2% per year, reaching **20% total (10% employee / 10% employer) by 2030**. [EY; PwC, other-taxes]

> A secondary payroll source claimed an 8%/4% pension split; this is **contradicted** by EY, PwC, and the Presidential Order, which all state an equal **6%/6%** split. Use 6%/6%.

### 5.12 Filing Deadlines

| Item | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Annual PIT declaration | 31 March of following year | [RRA notice; PwC, tax-administration] |
| PAYE return + remittance | 15th of the following month | [PwC, tax-administration] |
| Trading licence (patente) declaration | 31 January | [PwC, other-taxes] |

**Annual-return filing exemptions** (no annual return required): annual turnover < RWF 2,000,000; recipients of only employment income (PAYE already withheld); recipients of only withholding-taxed investment income; non-residents whose Rwanda-source income has had WHT applied. [PwC, individual]

### 5.13 Record Keeping

Records must be kept **10 years**; returns remain open to audit for **5 years**. [PwC, individual]

### 5.14 Penalties and Interest (Tax Procedures Law)

| Delay | Fine (% of tax due) |
|---|---|
| ≤ 30 days | 20% |
| 31 – 60 days | 40% |
| > 60 days | 60% |

**Declared on time but paid late:**

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction (Real Regime)

- Calculate proportion of home used for business (dedicated room/floor area as a percentage of the whole).
- Apply that percentage to rent, electricity (REG/EUCL), water (WASAC), internet.
- A dual-use room does NOT qualify.

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms the arrangement.

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use (Real Regime)

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Benefit-in-Kind Edge Cases

- Confirm whether housing/transport allowances are cash allowances (part of the RSSB pension base) or benefits in kind (statutory 20%/10% valuation).
- **Flag for reviewer:** the allowance split materially affects both PAYE and RSSB. [PwC, sample calc; EY]

### 6.5 Regime Election

- Electing into the real regime is irrevocable for 3 years — flag the long-term consequences for reviewer sign-off. [PwC, corporate]

### 6.6 Agriculture / Livestock Threshold

- Confirm the split between exempt (first RWF 12,000,000) and taxable agricultural income. [RRA register page]

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the worldwide-income basis without confirming residence status
- NEVER use the superseded 20% middle-band ("Year 1") schedule — the current middle band is 10%
- NEVER allow expense deductions for micro-enterprise (flat) or lump-sum (3%) taxpayers — those regimes tax turnover, not profit
- NEVER apply an 8%/4% pension split — the 2025 split is 6%/6%
- NEVER omit housing/transport allowances from the pension contribution base (they are now included from 2025)
- NEVER allow income tax itself, fines, or penalties as deductions
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales in turnover/income for VAT-registered self-employed
- NEVER apply the casual-labour 15% rate to a regular employee
- NEVER assume a national minimum wage figure — none is reliably enforceable
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and pending reviewer sign-off
