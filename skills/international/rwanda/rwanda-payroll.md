## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (PAYE — Pay-As-You-Earn)

Rwanda **does** levy personal income tax on employees. The employer is the
**withholding agent**: it deducts PAYE monthly from payroll and remits it monthly to RRA
by the 15th of the following month (PwC — Tax administration). The brackets are expressed on
**MONTHLY taxable employment income in RWF** and were set by **Law No. 027/2022 of 20/10/2022**,
with the bracket structure fully phased in from **November 2023** (PwC, last reviewed 18 Feb 2026;
RRA calculation guide).

### PAYE Progressive Table — Monthly Taxable Income (2025, CONFIRMED)

Source: RRA calculation guide (Law 027/2022, monthly bands, raised 0% threshold); PwC — Taxes on personal income.

| Monthly taxable income (RWF) | Marginal rate | Tax on this bracket (cumulative at top) |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 60,000 | **0%** | Frw 0 |
| 60,001 – 100,000 | **10%** | Frw 4,000 |
| 100,001 – 200,000 | **20%** | Frw 24,000 |
| 200,001 and above | **30%** | — |

- Same rates apply to **residents and non-residents** (PwC).
- **No local / municipal income taxes** in Rwanda (PwC).
- The 0% threshold (first Frw 60,000/month) was **raised from the prior Frw 30,000** when Law 027/2022 took effect (RRA).

**Subtract-method constants (2025)** — `monthly tax = (monthly taxable income × rate) − subtract`:

| Band (RWF) | Rate | Subtract (RWF) |
|---|---|---|
| 60,001 – 100,000 | 10% | 6,000 |
| 100,001 – 200,000 | 20% | 16,000 |
| 200,001+ | 30% | 36,000 |

*Continuity check:*
- At 100,000 → 0.10 × 100,000 − 6,000 = **Frw 4,000** (= cumulative band tax). Tie out.
- At 200,000 → 0.20 × 200,000 − 16,000 = **Frw 24,000**. Tie out.
- Band entry at 200,001 → 0.30 × 200,001 − 36,000 = **Frw 24,000.30** ≈ continuous with Frw 24,000. Tie out.

### Casual labour rate

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Casual labourer engaged **< 30 days** in a tax year | Employer withholds a flat **15%** of taxable employment income | RRA calculation guide |
| Tax-free portion for casual labour | Secondary sources conflict (Frw 30,000 older vs Frw 60,000 aligned to general threshold). The **15% flat rate is authoritative**; the exact tax-free slice is **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against current RRA casual-labour rules]** | RRA |

### Withholding mechanism

- PAYE is **withheld monthly by the employer** from payroll and remitted monthly to RRA by the 15th (PwC).
- **Individuals earning only employment income are exempt from filing an annual return** — PAYE is final (PwC — Tax administration). Those with additional income types must file by 31 March.

## Section 3 -- RSSB Pension Scheme (Employee + Employer)

All persons working in Rwanda (nationals and foreigners) must contribute to RSSB-managed schemes.
The **employer deducts, declares and pays both employer and employee shares** (RRA — RSSB declaration).

> **MAJOR 2025 CHANGE:** the pension rate **doubled from 6% to 12% effective 1 January 2025**,
> split equally employer/employee, with phased increases to **20% by 2030** (PwC — Other taxes;
> VisionsAfrica advisory). The contribution **base was expanded in 2025 to include the transport
> allowance** (previously excluded) (VisionsAfrica).

### Pension Contribution Schedule (basis: gross salary)

| Effective | Total | Employer | Employee |
|---|---|---|---|
| From 1 Jan 2025 | **12%** | 6% | 6% |
| From 1 Jan 2027 | 14% | 7% | 7% |
| From 1 Jan 2028 | 16% | 8% | 8% |
| From 1 Jan 2029 | 18% | 9% | 9% |
| From 1 Jan 2030 | 20% | 10% | 10% |

Source: PwC — Other taxes (full schedule, splits, basis); VisionsAfrica (2025 base now includes transport).

- Prior rate (through 2024) was **6% total / 3% each** (PwC).
- **No salary ceiling/cap** on pension was found in authoritative sources — contributions appear
  uncapped (percentage of full gross). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm absence of a ceiling with RSSB]**.

*Column check (2025):* employer 6% + employee 6% = **12%** total. Tie out.

---

## Section 4 -- RSSB Occupational Hazards Scheme

| Item | Total | Employer | Employee | Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Occupational hazards | **2%** | **2%** | **0%** | Gross salary | PwC — Other taxes |

- Employer pays **100%** of the 2%; the employee pays nothing.

*Column check:* employer 2% + employee 0% = **2%** total. Tie out.

---

## Section 5 -- RSSB Maternity Leave Benefits Scheme

| Item | Total | Employer | Employee | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Maternity leave benefits | **0.6%** | **0.3%** | **0.3%** | PwC — Other taxes |

- **Basis:** gross pay including benefits in kind, **excluding transport allowance and
  termination/retirement benefits** (PwC).

*Column check:* employer 0.3% + employee 0.3% = **0.6%** total. Tie out.

---

## Section 6 -- RSSB Medical Insurance Scheme (RAMA / RSSB medical)

| Item | Total | Employer | Employee | Basis | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Medical insurance | **15%** | **7.5%** | **7.5%** | **BASIC salary** | RRA — Medical Insurance Scheme |

- **Mandatory for civil servants / public institutions.** Private institutions may/must enrol if
  they meet registration requirements — must have **at least 7 employees** and **enrol all staff**
  (no individual opt-outs) (RRA).
- Pensioners: **7.5%** deducted from monthly pension (RRA).
- Basis is **basic salary**, not full gross (distinct from pension/occupational/maternity which use gross).

*Column check:* employer 7.5% + employee 7.5% = **15%** total. Tie out.

---

## Section 7 -- Community-Based Health Insurance (CBHI / Mutuelle de Santé)

| Item | Total | Employer | Employee | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CBHI / CBHIS | **0.5%** | **0% (collects only)** | **0.5%** | PwC — Other taxes |

- **Employee-only** contribution; the employer collects and remits it but pays no employer share.
- **Basis: NET salary** = gross salary + taxable benefits − PAYE − pension − occupational hazards
  − maternity contributions (PwC). (Medical insurance is **not** subtracted in arriving at the CBHI base.)

*Column check:* employer 0% + employee 0.5% = **0.5%** total. Tie out.

---

## Section 8 -- Combined Employer / Employee Social Burden (2025)

For a **private employer enrolled in the medical scheme** (7+ employees), on an employee with no
separate transport-allowance split (so basic = gross for illustration):

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| PAYE | 0–30% progressive | (withholding agent) | monthly taxable income |
| Pension | 6% | 6% | gross |
| Occupational hazards | — | 2% | gross |
| Maternity | 0.3% | 0.3% | gross (excl. transport / termination) |
| Medical insurance | 7.5% | 7.5% | basic |
| CBHI | 0.5% | — | net |

*Employee social column (excl. PAYE, where basic = gross):* 6% + 0.3% + 7.5% + 0.5% = **14.3%** (the
CBHI 0.5% is on net, the rest on gross/basic, so this is an upper-bound shorthand — compute each on its own base).
*Employer social column (where basic = gross):* 6% + 2% + 0.3% + 7.5% = **15.8%** of gross.

> If the employer is **not** enrolled in the medical scheme (e.g. fewer than 7 employees and not a
> public institution), drop the 7.5% / 7.5% medical lines. CBHI 0.5% (employee) and the other RSSB
> schemes still apply.

---

## Section 9 -- Minimum Wage

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Statutory national minimum wage | **None effective / enforceable.** The only formally established rate dates to **1974 (Frw 100/day ≈ Frw 2,440/month)** and is obsolete and not enforced | Mywage.org / WageIndicator |
| Practice | Wages set by **sector agreements / collective bargaining** (e.g. mining sector living wage ~Frw 1,500/day as of 2025) | Mywage.org / WageIndicator |
| Status | A statutory minimum wage has been discussed but **not yet introduced** | Mywage.org / WageIndicator |

> Do **not** rely on the 1974 figure as a contractual floor. Use the employee's contract and any
> applicable sector agreement; flag for the reviewer where no sector benchmark exists.

---

## Section 10 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is missing or ambiguous, apply the **conservative** assumption (the one that does
NOT understate withholding/contributions) and FLAG it for the reviewer.

| Unknown | Conservative default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Whether employer is enrolled in medical scheme | If headcount ≥ 7 → assume **enrolled** (7.5%/7.5%); FLAG | Mandatory once registration criteria met |
| Headcount unknown | Compute **without** medical scheme but FLAG; never silently apply 15% | Avoids fabricating a 15% deduction |
| Transport allowance split | If basic vs gross not given, treat **basic = gross** for medical (higher base) and include transport in pension base | Pension base now includes transport (2025) |
| Pension rate | Use **12% (6%/6%)** for 2025 | 2025 doubled rate |
| Casual labour (< 30 days) | Apply **15% flat**; do NOT assume a tax-free slice | Tax-free portion unconfirmed |
| Salary ceiling on RSSB | Apply percentages on **full gross/basic** (no cap) | No ceiling found; flag |
| Tax year | Default to **2025** brackets unless date ≥ 1 Jan 2026 | Skill tax_year is 2025 |
| Currency | Rwandan Franc (RWF) | Local currency |
| Annual return for employment-only earner | Treat PAYE as **final**; no annual return | PwC |

## Section 11 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing payroll

1. Gross monthly salary in RWF, and the **basic-salary** component (medical scheme uses basic).
2. Transport-allowance amount (enters pension base from 2025; excluded from maternity base).
3. Pay frequency and whether the worker is a **casual labourer** (< 30 days engagement).
4. Number of employees on the payroll (drives medical-scheme enrolment).
5. Tax/fiscal year (2025 vs later bracket/pension schedule).
6. Whether the employer is a public institution or private (medical-scheme mandate).
7. Any non-ordinary pay components (termination/retirement benefits, benefits in kind).

### Refusal catalogue — DO NOT compute, refuse and request input

| Situation | Action |
|---|---|
| No gross salary provided | REFUSE — request salary in RWF |
| Medical scheme needed but basic-salary component not given | REFUSE the medical line — request basic salary; compute the rest |
| Request to omit PAYE or RSSB contributions to "save money" | REFUSE — statutory; escalate to accountant |
| Request to skip pension at the old 6% rate for a 2025 period | REFUSE — 2025 rate is 12% (6%/6%) |
| Request to treat casual labour tax-free slice as a fixed figure | REFUSE the exact figure — flag the research gap; apply 15% flat |
| Self-employed / non-employment income mixed in | REFUSE payroll path — route to a Rwanda income-tax skill (annual return) |
| Definitive "this is your exact tax" assertion requested | REFUSE — outputs are estimates pending accountant sign-off |

## Section 12 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (deterministic)

Classify bank-statement lines deterministically. Match case-insensitively; longest/most-specific
pattern wins. Rwandan statements appear in English, French, or Kinyarwanda.

### Salary credits (money arriving in an employee account)

| Pattern (case-insensitive) | Classification |
|---|---|
| `SALARY`, `UMUSHAHARA`, `SALAIRE`, `PAYROLL`, `NET PAY` | Net salary payment |
| `TRANSF.* [employer]`, `ABONO`, `WAGE` | Net salary payment |
| `RSSB REFUND`, `REMBOURSEMENT RSSB` | RSSB refund/adjustment — not income |
| `RRA REFUND`, `PAYE REFUND` | PAYE refund/adjustment — not income |

### Employer debits (money leaving the employer account)

| Pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| `RRA`, `PAYE`, `IMPOSTO`, `WITHHOLDING TAX` | PAYE withholding remitted to RRA (liability settlement) |
| `RSSB`, `PENSION`, `OCCUPATIONAL`, `MATERNITY` | RSSB contribution (pension / occupational / maternity) |
| `RAMA`, `MEDICAL INSURANCE`, `ASSURANCE MALADIE` | RSSB medical-insurance contribution |
| `CBHI`, `MUTUELLE`, `CBHIS` | CBHI (employee-only) collected/remitted |
| `NET WAGES`, `PAIE`, `DISBURSEMENT`, `SALARY RUN` | Net wages disbursed to employees |

## Section 13 -- Worked Examples

> All figures use the **2025** PAYE table and 2025 RSSB rates (pension 6%/6%). Where the employer is
> enrolled in the medical scheme, basic = gross is assumed for illustration. Occupational hazards is
> employer-only (no employee deduction). CBHI base = gross − PAYE − pension − occupational(0 ee) −
> maternity. Amounts rounded to the franc/centime.

### Example 1 — Low earner below the exempt threshold (no medical scheme)

**Inputs:** Gross salary Frw 50,000/month. Small employer (< 7 staff), **not** medical-enrolled.

- PAYE: 50,000 ≤ 60,000 → **Frw 0**.
- Pension employee 6% × 50,000 = **Frw 3,000**.
- Maternity employee 0.3% × 50,000 = **Frw 150**.
- CBHI base (net) = 50,000 − 0 − 3,000 − 0 − 150 = 46,850 → CBHI 0.5% × 46,850 = **Frw 234.25**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 3,000 + 150 + 234.25 = **Frw 3,384.25**.
- **Net pay** = 50,000.00 − 3,384.25 = **Frw 46,615.75**.

*Bank line example:* `UMUSHAHARA — JUNE` credit **Frw 46,615.75**.

### Example 2 — Mid earner in the 20% PAYE band (medical-enrolled)

**Inputs:** Gross = basic = Frw 150,000/month. Private employer, ≥ 7 staff, medical-enrolled.

- PAYE: 150,000 in 20% band → 0.20 × 150,000 − 16,000 = 30,000 − 16,000 = **Frw 14,000**.
  - Verify by bands: 0 (first 60k) + 4,000 (60k–100k @10%) + 10,000 (100k–150k @20%) = 14,000. Tie out.
- Pension employee 6% × 150,000 = **Frw 9,000**.
- Maternity employee 0.3% × 150,000 = **Frw 450**.
- Medical employee 7.5% × basic 150,000 = **Frw 11,250**.
- CBHI base (net) = 150,000 − 14,000 − 9,000 − 0 − 450 = 126,550 → CBHI 0.5% = **Frw 632.75**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 14,000 + 9,000 + 450 + 11,250 + 632.75 = **Frw 35,332.75**.
- **Net pay** = 150,000.00 − 35,332.75 = **Frw 114,667.25**.

### Example 3 — Higher earner in the 30% PAYE band (medical-enrolled)

**Inputs:** Gross = basic = Frw 500,000/month. Private employer, medical-enrolled.

- PAYE: 500,000 in 30% band → 0.30 × 500,000 − 36,000 = 150,000 − 36,000 = **Frw 114,000**.
  - Verify by bands: 0 + 4,000 + 20,000 (100k–200k @20%) + 90,000 (200k–500k @30%) = 114,000. Tie out.
- Pension employee 6% × 500,000 = **Frw 30,000**.
- Maternity employee 0.3% × 500,000 = **Frw 1,500**.
- Medical employee 7.5% × 500,000 = **Frw 37,500**.
- CBHI base (net) = 500,000 − 114,000 − 30,000 − 0 − 1,500 = 354,500 → CBHI 0.5% = **Frw 1,772.50**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 114,000 + 30,000 + 1,500 + 37,500 + 1,772.50 = **Frw 184,772.50**.
- **Net pay** = 500,000.00 − 184,772.50 = **Frw 315,227.50**.

### Example 4 — Employer total cost of the mid earner (Frw 150,000/month, medical-enrolled)

Building on Example 2 (gross = basic = Frw 150,000):

| Employer cost item | Computation | Amount (Frw) |
|---|---|---|
| Gross salary | — | 150,000.00 |
| Pension employer 6% | 6% × 150,000 | 9,000.00 |
| Occupational hazards 2% | 2% × 150,000 | 3,000.00 |
| Maternity employer 0.3% | 0.3% × 150,000 | 450.00 |
| Medical employer 7.5% | 7.5% × 150,000 | 11,250.00 |
| CBHI employer share | — (employee-only) | 0.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | sum | **173,700.00** |

*Check:* 150,000 + 9,000 + 3,000 + 450 + 11,250 = **173,700.00**. Tie out.
(Employer-on-top burden = Frw 23,700.00 = **15.8%** of gross at this salary.)

### Example 5 — Casual labourer (< 30 days)

**Inputs:** Casual engagement, taxable employment income Frw 80,000 for the period.

- PAYE = flat **15% × 80,000 = Frw 12,000** (RRA casual-labour rate).
- Net of PAYE = 80,000 − 12,000 = **Frw 68,000**.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** A tax-free portion for casual labour may apply before the
> 15% (Frw 30,000 vs Frw 60,000 in conflicting secondary sources). This example applies 15% to the
> full Frw 80,000; confirm the exact tax-free slice against current RRA casual-labour rules.

### Example 6 — Earner exactly at the exempt boundary (Frw 60,000, no medical scheme)

**Inputs:** Gross salary Frw 60,000/month. Small employer, **not** medical-enrolled.

- PAYE: 60,000 ≤ 60,000 → **Frw 0**.
- Pension employee 6% × 60,000 = **Frw 3,600**.
- Maternity employee 0.3% × 60,000 = **Frw 180**.
- CBHI base (net) = 60,000 − 0 − 3,600 − 0 − 180 = 56,220 → CBHI 0.5% = **Frw 281.10**.
- **Employee deductions total** = 3,600 + 180 + 281.10 = **Frw 4,061.10**.
- **Net pay** = 60,000.00 − 4,061.10 = **Frw 55,938.90**.

## Section 14 -- Tier 1 Rules (hard, non-negotiable)

1. PAYE is **employer-withheld monthly** and remitted to RRA by the **15th** of the following month; never skip it for salaried staff (PwC).
2. Use the **monthly** taxable-income table and apply the subtract-method constants exactly (6,000 / 16,000 / 36,000).
3. **Pension is 12% (6%/6%) for 2025** — never use the old 6% rate for a 2025 period (PwC; VisionsAfrica).
4. The pension base **includes the transport allowance** from 2025 (VisionsAfrica).
5. Occupational hazards (2%) is **employer-only**; maternity (0.6%) splits **0.3%/0.3%**.
6. Medical insurance (15%, 7.5%/7.5%) is on **basic** salary and applies only where the employer is enrolled (public, or private with ≥ 7 employees, all staff enrolled) (RRA).
7. CBHI (0.5%) is **employee-only**, on **net** salary; the employer collects but pays no share (PwC).
8. RSSB contributions are remitted **monthly** by the **15th** of the following month (RRA).
9. Every output is an **estimate** pending licensed-accountant sign-off.

## Section 15 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

| Question | Why it needs a reviewer |
|---|---|
| Casual-labour tax-free portion (30,000 vs 60,000) | Secondary sources conflict; only the 15% flat rate is confirmed |
| Penalty percentages (20% / 40% / 60%) | Sourced from an advisory firm summarising Law 020/2023, not RRA primary text |
| Medical-scheme remittance date (10th vs 15th) | One RRA medical page references the 10th; general RSSB deadline is the 15th |
| Absence of an RSSB salary ceiling/cap | No cap found in sources; confirm explicitly with RSSB |
| Exact maternity-base treatment of benefits in kind | "Excl. transport/termination" confirmed; in-kind edge cases not |
| Whether a specific private employer must enrol in medical scheme | Depends on ≥ 7 employees + registration criteria |

## Section 18 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement lacks key data:

1. **No prior payroll register available** → request the last 3 months of payroll and RRA/RSSB receipts to back-solve the rates actually applied.
2. **Unknown headcount** → default medical scheme OFF, FLAG; confirm before first remittance.
3. **Unknown basic-vs-gross split** → request the contract; medical needs basic salary specifically.
4. **Unknown transport allowance** → confirm; it enters the pension base (2025) and is excluded from the maternity base.
5. **Year ambiguity** → default 2025 table/rates; switch only for periods ≥ 1 Jan of a later year (pension steps up again in 2027).

## Section 20 -- Penalties (late filing / late payment)

Governed by the **Tax Procedures Law (Law No. 020/2023)** and RSSB rules.

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late declaration / late payment (≤ 30 days) | **20%** of tax due | ALSM — Law 020/2023 summary |
| Late by 31–60 days | **40%** of tax due | ALSM — Law 020/2023 summary |
| Late by more than 60 days | **60%** of tax due | ALSM — Law 020/2023 summary |
| Late-payment interest | **1.5% per month** on the overdue amount | ALSM; RRA — RSSB declaration |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The graduated penalty percentages (20% / 40% / 60%) are
> from a reputable Rwandan tax-advisory firm summarising Law 020/2023, **not** the RRA primary Tax
> Procedures Law text. The RRA Tax Handbook was unreachable during research; cross-check the exact

## Section 22 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputes end-to-end. Expected values use the 2025 PAYE table and 2025 RSSB rates.

1. **Exempt earner.** Gross Frw 50,000/mo, no medical scheme. Expected: PAYE = **Frw 0**;
   employee pension **Frw 3,000**; maternity **Frw 150**; CBHI **Frw 234.25**; net **Frw 46,615.75**.
2. **20% band, medical-enrolled.** Gross = basic Frw 150,000/mo. PAYE **Frw 14,000**;
   pension **Frw 9,000**; maternity **Frw 450**; medical **Frw 11,250**; CBHI **Frw 632.75**;
   net **Frw 114,667.25**.
3. **30% band, medical-enrolled.** Gross = basic Frw 500,000/mo. PAYE **Frw 114,000**;
   medical **Frw 37,500**; CBHI **Frw 1,772.50**; net **Frw 315,227.50**.
4. **Employer cost.** Gross = basic Frw 150,000/mo, medical-enrolled. Total employer cost **Frw 173,700.00**
   (burden 15.8% of gross).
5. **Casual labour.** Taxable income Frw 80,000, < 30 days. PAYE = **Frw 12,000** (15% flat);
   net of PAYE **Frw 68,000** (tax-free slice is a research gap).
6. **Boundary earner.** Gross Frw 60,000/mo, no medical. PAYE **Frw 0**; net **Frw 55,938.90**.
7. **Bracket continuity.** At monthly 100,000 → PAYE **Frw 4,000**; at 200,000 → PAYE **Frw 24,000**
   (subtract constants 6,000 / 16,000 / 36,000 tie out).
8. **Pension rate guard.** A 2025 period computed at the old 6% total (3%/3%) is WRONG — must be 12% (6%/6%).
9. **CBHI base.** Gross 150,000, PAYE 14,000, pension 9,000, maternity 450 → CBHI base **126,550**;
   CBHI **Frw 632.75** (medical NOT subtracted in the base).
10. **Currency / minimum-wage refusal.** Treating the 1974 Frw 100/day as a contractual floor → REFUSE;
    request the contract / sector benchmark.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER skip PAYE withholding for salaried employees — the employer is the legal withholding agent.
- NEVER use the old 6% total pension rate for a 2025 period — it doubled to 12% (6%/6%) on 1 Jan 2025.
- NEVER omit the transport allowance from the pension base for 2025 onward.
- NEVER apply the medical-insurance 15% to full gross — it is on **basic** salary, and only where the employer is enrolled.
- NEVER charge an employer share of CBHI — it is employee-only (0.5% on net); the employer only collects.
- NEVER assume a fixed casual-labour tax-free slice — apply 15% flat and flag the research gap.
- NEVER state the 20%/40%/60% penalty percentages as RRA-confirmed — they are an advisory-firm summary of Law 020/2023.
- NEVER apply an RSSB salary ceiling without confirming one exists — no cap was found in the sources.
- NEVER rely on the obsolete 1974 minimum wage as a contractual floor.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Rwandan accountant.
