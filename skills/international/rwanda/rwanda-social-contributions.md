  Use this skill whenever asked about Rwanda payroll taxes, PAYE, or social security / RSSB contributions for employees and employers. Trigger on phrases like "how much PAYE in Rwanda", "RSSB pension contribution", "Rwanda social security rate", "what is the pension rate 2025", "occupational hazards contribution", "maternity scheme RSSB", "CBHIS deduction", "RAMA / medical insurance scheme", "net pay calculation Rwanda", "casual labour tax rate", "Rwanda monthly declaration deadline", or any question about an employee's or employer's RSSB / RRA obligations. Also trigger when classifying bank statement transactions that relate to RRA tax payments, RSSB contribution debits, or PAYE remittances from Bank of Kigali, BPR, Equity Bank Rwanda, I&M Bank or other Rwandan banks. Also trigger when preparing or reviewing a monthly unified PAYE + RSSB declaration on E-Tax / MyRRA. This skill covers the 2025 PAYE brackets, the five RSSB schemes (pension, occupational hazards, maternity, CBHIS, medical), their differing contribution bases, the unified monthly declaration, penalties and interest under the Tax Procedures Law, expat/KIFC treatment, bank statement classification patterns, and edge cases. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Rwanda payroll or social-contribution work.

# Rwanda PAYE & RSSB Social Contributions Skill v0.1

> Rwanda **does** levy personal income tax. This is a standard PAYE + social-insurance jurisdiction. Payroll obligations are filed jointly to the **Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA)** and the **Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB)** via a single monthly declaration on **E-Tax / MyRRA**.

**RSSB scheme overview (2025):**

| Scheme | Employee | Employer | Total | Contribution base |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension | 6% | 6% | 12% | Gross salary (incl. transport allowance from 1 Jan 2025) |
| Occupational hazards | 0% | 2% | 2% | Gross salary |
| Maternity leave benefits | 0.3% | 0.3% | 0.6% | Gross pay excl. transport & termination/retirement benefits |
| CBHIS (community health) | 0.5% | 0% | 0.5% | Net salary (gross + benefits less PAYE, pension, occ. hazards, maternity) |
| Medical (RAMA, if enrolled) | 7.5% | 7.5% | 15% | Basic salary |

*Arithmetic check: Pension 6+6=12; Occ. hazards 0+2=2; Maternity 0.3+0.3=0.6; CBHIS 0.5+0=0.5; Medical 7.5+7.5=15. Each total row equals the sum of its components.*
Source for the full breakdown: PwC Rwanda -- Corporate "Other taxes" (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/rwanda/corporate/other-taxes) and the PwC sample personal income tax calculation (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/rwanda/individual/sample-personal-income-tax-calculation). Medical scheme: RRA -- Medical Insurance Scheme (https://www.rra.gov.rw/en/details?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=469&cHash=dc8044c4d18d710cf5ab2cc68f2283b4).

**Note on the differing bases.** This is the single most error-prone feature of Rwanda payroll: the four mandatory schemes use *different* contribution bases. Pension and occupational hazards are on **gross**; maternity is on **gross excluding transport**; CBHIS is on **net** (after PAYE and the other deductions); medical (RAMA) is on **basic** salary. Do not apply one base across all schemes.

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether transport allowance is paid | Assume transport is part of gross (pension base now includes it from 2025); flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether employer is RAMA/medical-enrolled | Assume NOT enrolled (medical is mandatory only for civil servants; private opt-in needs ≥7 employees); flag for reviewer |
| Unknown residency status | Assume resident (taxed on worldwide income); flag for reviewer to confirm |
| Unknown whether worker is casual labour | Assume regular employee on progressive brackets, not the 15% flat rate; flag |
| Unknown basic vs gross split | Cannot compute medical contribution; STOP and request the basic-salary figure |
| Ambiguous RRA/RSSB bank debit (tax vs penalty) | Classify as statutory remittance; flag for reviewer |
| KIFC foreign-income exemption claimed | Do not apply; escalate to reviewer (case-specific licensing required) |

## Section 2 -- PAYE brackets and rates (2025)

Progressive **monthly** brackets, in force since November 2023 (Law No. 027/2022 of 20/10/2022, Art. 56 second-year rates, still current for 2025). Source: RRA "new rates" guide (https://www.rra.gov.rw/en/details?tx_news_pi1%5Baction%5D=detail&tx_news_pi1%5Bcontroller%5D=News&tx_news_pi1%5Bnews%5D=1669&cHash=8a281f98a1e1d9501765985f3a91fe8d) and PwC Rwanda -- Taxes on personal income (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/rwanda/individual/taxes-on-personal-income).

| Monthly taxable income (RWF) | Rate | Tax on this band | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 60,000 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| 60,001 -- 100,000 | 10% | 4,000 | 4,000 |
| 100,001 -- 200,000 | 20% | 20,000 | 24,000 |
| 200,001 and above | 30% | — | — |

*Cumulative check: band 2 = 10% × 40,000 = 4,000 → cumulative 4,000. Band 3 = 20% × 100,000 = 20,000 → cumulative 24,000. Consistent.*

**PAYE shortcut formula (monthly taxable income `B`, in RWF):**

```
If B <= 60,000        PAYE = 0
If 60,001..100,000    PAYE = (B - 60,000) * 0.10
If 100,001..200,000   PAYE = 4,000 + (B - 100,000) * 0.20
If B >= 200,001       PAYE = 24,000 + (B - 200,000) * 0.30
```

## Section 3 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- gross monthly salary and whether a transport allowance is included. Without the gross figure, STOP.

**Recommended** -- the basic-salary component (needed if medical/RAMA applies), the transport-allowance amount (excluded from the maternity base), residency status, and whether the worker is a regular employee or casual labour.

**Ideal** -- the employer's RSSB registration status and which schemes apply (medical/RAMA optional), the E-Tax/MyRRA monthly declaration, and bank statements showing RRA/RSSB remittances.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-RW-1 -- Medical (RAMA) contribution without basic salary.** *Trigger:* employer is RAMA-enrolled but only the gross figure is supplied. *Message:* "The medical scheme contribution (7.5% employee + 7.5% employer) is computed on **basic** salary, not gross. Cannot compute without the basic-salary component."

**R-RW-2 -- KIFC foreign-income exemption.** *Trigger:* client claims the 5-year KIFC exemption on foreign-sourced income. *Message:* "The KIFC PIT exemption depends on holding a qualifying KIFC licence and on the source/timing of the income. This is case-specific and outside the scope of this skill. Escalate to a Rwandan licensed accountant / RRA-registered tax agent."

**R-RW-3 -- Arrears, penalties and interest.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid PAYE/RSSB and asks for the total owed. *Message:* "Late-payment interest (0.5%--1.5%/month, capped at 100% of annual tax) and administrative fines (5%--30%, plus a possible 60% non-declaration penalty) under Tax Procedures Law No. 020/2023 depend on the exact delay and turnover band. Do not estimate. Request an RRA statement and escalate to a reviewer."

**R-RW-4 -- Pension phased increases beyond 2025.** *Trigger:* client asks for pension contributions for 2027 onward. *Message:* "The scheduled pension step-ups (7% each from 2027 up to 10% each by 2030) are reported by PwC but I have not confirmed the underlying RSSB ministerial order text. Treat the 2025 6%+6% rate as firm; flag future years for reviewer confirmation. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm 2027--2030 steps against the RSSB order.]"

**R-RW-5 -- Minimum wage.** *Trigger:* client asks for the national minimum wage. *Message:* "Rwanda has **no enforceable national minimum wage**; the 1974 statutory rate is obsolete and effective wages are set by sector/collective agreement. The widely cited ~RWF 60,000/month figure is unconfirmed press/HR-guide speculation. [RESEARCH GAP -- no gazetted statutory rate; reviewer to confirm.]"

## Section 4 -- Payment pattern library

Deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Rwanda payroll taxes and RSSB. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference. RRA tax and RSSB contributions are statutory remittances -- always EXCLUDE from any VAT return or revenue/expense P&L classification beyond their proper payroll-liability treatment.

### 4.1 RRA tax remittances (PAYE and other)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RRA, RWANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY | EXCLUDE -- statutory tax remittance | PAYE / income tax / VAT payment to RRA |
| PAYE, P.A.Y.E | EXCLUDE -- employee income tax remitted | Monthly PAYE |
| E-TAX, MYRRA, ETAX | EXCLUDE -- RRA portal payment | Unified declaration settlement |
| IMISORO, UMUSORO | EXCLUDE -- tax (Kinyarwanda "umusoro" = tax) | Generic tax reference |

### 4.2 RSSB social-contribution remittances

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| RSSB, RWANDA SOCIAL SECURITY BOARD | EXCLUDE -- social contribution remittance | Pension / occ. hazards / maternity / CBHIS |
| PENSION, RETIREMENT CONTRIB | EXCLUDE -- pension contribution | RSSB pension scheme |
| RAMA, MEDICAL SCHEME, ASSURANCE MALADIE | EXCLUDE -- medical scheme | RSSB medical (formerly RAMA) |
| CBHI, CBHIS, MUTUELLE, MUTUELLE DE SANTE | EXCLUDE -- community health contribution | Community-Based Health Insurance |
| KUBAKA, IMITURIRE (transport allowance ref) | Component of gross -- see base notes | Affects pension/maternity bases |

### 4.3 Rwandan bank debit descriptions

| Bank | Typical debit description | Treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Bank of Kigali (BK) | "RRA TAX", "RSSB CONTRIB", "PAYE" | EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance |
| BPR Bank (Atlas Mara / BPR) | "RWANDA REVENUE", "RSSB" | EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance |
| Equity Bank Rwanda | "RRA E-TAX", "RSSB PENSION" | EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance |
| I&M Bank Rwanda | "RRA", "SOCIAL SECURITY" | EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance |
| Mobile money (MoMo / Airtel Money) | "RRA PAYMENT", "RSSB" | EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance |

### 4.4 Payroll and benefits received (not contributions)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARY, UMUSHAHARA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net wage paid to employee, not a contribution |
| RSSB PENSION (incoming credit) | EXCLUDE -- pension benefit received | Inbound benefit, not a contribution paid |
| MATERNITY BENEFIT (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- benefit received | Not a contribution |

## Section 5 -- Worked examples

Five payroll computations and bank-statement classifications for a hypothetical Kigali employer and its staff. All figures in RWF. The employer is **not** RAMA-enrolled unless stated (so no 7.5% medical) — the four mandatory schemes apply.

### Example 1 -- Standard salaried employee, full computation

**Input:** Gross monthly salary RWF 500,000, of which transport allowance RWF 30,000. Resident, regular employee, employer not RAMA-enrolled.

**Step 1 -- Employee social security (deductible before PAYE):**
- Pension EE = 6% × 500,000 = **30,000** (base: gross incl. transport)
- Occupational hazards EE = 0% × 500,000 = **0**
- Maternity EE = 0.3% × (500,000 − 30,000) = 0.3% × 470,000 = **1,410** (base: gross excl. transport)

**Step 2 -- PAYE taxable base:** 500,000 − 30,000 − 0 − 1,410 = **468,590**

**Step 3 -- PAYE** (B = 468,590, top band): 24,000 + 0.30 × (468,590 − 200,000) = 24,000 + 0.30 × 268,590 = 24,000 + 80,577 = **104,577**

**Step 4 -- CBHIS** (base = net = gross − PAYE − pension − occ. hazards − maternity): 500,000 − 104,577 − 30,000 − 0 − 1,410 = 364,013; CBHIS EE = 0.5% × 364,013 = **1,820.07**

**Step 5 -- Net pay:** 500,000 − 30,000 − 1,410 − 104,577 − 1,820.07 = **362,192.93**

**Employer-side cost on top of gross:** pension ER 6% × 500,000 = 30,000; occ. hazards 2% × 500,000 = 10,000; maternity ER 0.3% × 470,000 = 1,410. Employer total = **41,410**.

**Classification:** the RRA PAYE remittance of 104,577 and the RSSB contributions are EXCLUDE -- statutory remittances on the unified monthly declaration (due 15th of next month).

### Example 2 -- Low earner below the PAYE threshold

**Input:** Gross monthly salary RWF 55,000, no transport allowance. Regular employee, not RAMA-enrolled.

**Reasoning:**
- Pension EE = 6% × 55,000 = 3,300; occ. hazards EE = 0; maternity EE = 0.3% × 55,000 = 165.
- PAYE base = 55,000 − 3,300 − 165 = 51,535 → **below 60,000 → PAYE = 0**.
- CBHIS net base = 55,000 − 0 − 3,300 − 0 − 165 = 51,535; CBHIS EE = 0.5% × 51,535 = 257.675 ≈ **257.68**.
- Net pay = 55,000 − 3,300 − 165 − 0 − 257.68 = **51,277.32**.

**Classification:** No PAYE due this month, but RSSB contributions still apply and must be declared.

### Example 3 -- Casual labourer (flat 15%)

**Input:** Casual worker paid RWF 80,000 for a short engagement.

**Reasoning:** Casual labour uses the flat **15%** special rate, not the progressive brackets. PAYE = 15% × 80,000 = **12,000**. (RSSB treatment of casual labour is case-specific; flag for reviewer whether the engagement triggers RSSB registration.)

**Classification:** RRA remittance of 12,000 -- EXCLUDE, statutory tax remittance. Flag RSSB applicability.

### Example 4 -- RRA/RSSB bank debit on the unified declaration

**Input line:**
`13.02.2025 ; RWANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY ; DEBIT ; E-TAX PAYE+RSSB JAN 2025 ; -145,987 ; RWF`

**Reasoning:** Matches "RWANDA REVENUE AUTHORITY" / "E-TAX" (patterns 4.1). This is the January 2025 unified PAYE + RSSB declaration settled before the 15 Feb deadline. EXCLUDE from VAT/P&L; it clears the payroll statutory liabilities.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- statutory remittance (PAYE + RSSB). Paid on time (before 15th).

### Example 5 -- Ambiguous RSSB debit (possible penalty/arrears)

**Input line:**
`28.03.2025 ; RSSB CONTRIB ; DEBIT ; ARREARS + INTEREST ; -512,300 ; RWF`

**Reasoning:** Matches "RSSB" (pattern 4.2) but the reference says "ARREARS + INTEREST" and the amount is irregular. Under Tax Procedures Law No. 020/2023, late payment carries interest (0.5%--1.5%/month, capped at 100% of annual tax) plus administrative fines (5%/10%/30%). Cannot separate principal from interest/penalty without an RRA/RSSB statement.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from VAT. Flag for reviewer -- request the RRA/RSSB breakdown to split contribution principal from interest and penalty.

## Section 6 -- Tier 1 rules

Apply exactly as written when inputs are clear.

### Rule 1 -- Compute employee social security first, then PAYE

Deduct pension, occupational hazards and maternity (employee shares) from gross to get the PAYE taxable base. CBHIS is computed **after** PAYE (it sits on net). Source: PwC Rwanda -- sample personal income tax calculation.

### Rule 2 -- Use the correct base per scheme

Pension & occupational hazards → **gross**. Maternity → **gross excl. transport & termination/retirement benefits**. CBHIS → **net** (gross + benefits − PAYE − pension − occ. hazards − maternity). Medical/RAMA → **basic** salary. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Other taxes; RRA -- Medical Insurance Scheme.

### Rule 3 -- Pension is 6% + 6% in 2025 and includes transport

From 1 Jan 2025 the pension rate is 6% employee + 6% employer (doubled from 3%+3%), and the base now includes the transport allowance (harmonised with the PAYE base). Source: PwC Rwanda -- Other taxes. Future step-ups (2027--2030) are scheduled but unconfirmed at source — see Rule 11.

### Rule 4 -- Occupational hazards is employer-only

2% employer, 0% employee, on gross. Never deduct it from the employee. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Other taxes.

### Rule 5 -- Maternity is 0.3% each, excluding transport

0.3% employee + 0.3% employer on gross **excluding** transport and termination/retirement benefits. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Other taxes.

### Rule 6 -- CBHIS is employee-only on net

0.5% employee, 0% employer, on **net** salary as defined in Rule 2. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Other taxes.

### Rule 7 -- Medical (RAMA) only if enrolled

7.5% employee + 7.5% employer on **basic** salary, due by the **10th** of the following month. Mandatory for civil servants (automatic). Private institutions may opt in but must enrol **all** employees and need **at least 7 employees**. If enrolment is unknown, assume not enrolled and flag. Source: RRA -- Medical Insurance Scheme.

### Rule 8 -- PAYE brackets are monthly and progressive

0% to 60,000; 10% on 60,001--100,000; 20% on 100,001--200,000; 30% above 200,000. Casual labour is a flat 15%. Source: RRA new-rates guide; PwC Rwanda -- Taxes on personal income.

### Rule 9 -- Residency drives scope

Residents: worldwide income. Non-residents: Rwanda-sourced only. No local income taxes. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Taxes on personal income.

### Rule 10 -- Unified monthly declaration deadline

PAYE + RSSB (except voluntary pension) are declared and paid via E-Tax/MyRRA by the **15th** of the following month. RSSB medical itself is due the **10th**. Annual individual return due **31 March** of the following year. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Tax administration; RRA PAYE declaration page (https://www.rra.gov.rw/en/domestic-tax-services/employment-tax-paye/declare-paye).

### Rule 11 -- Treat 2025 rates as firm; flag future years

The 2025 6%+6% pension rate is firm. The scheduled increases (7% each in 2027, 8% in 2028, 9% in 2029, 10% in 2030) come from PwC only and lack confirmed primary-order text. Do not apply them silently. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm 2027--2030 steps.]

---

## Section 7 -- Tier 2 catalogue (reviewer judgement)

Flag these for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- Transport allowance treatment

**Trigger:** the gross/transport split is unclear or transport is paid as a separate line.
**Issue:** transport is **included** in the pension base (from 2025) but **excluded** from the maternity base. Mis-classifying it shifts both contributions and the PAYE base.
**Action:** confirm the exact transport amount before computing.

### T2-2 -- Medical (RAMA) enrolment

**Trigger:** employer's RSSB medical enrolment status unknown, or fewer than 7 employees.
**Issue:** medical is mandatory only for civil servants; private opt-in requires all-employee enrolment and ≥7 staff. The base is **basic** salary, not gross.
**Action:** confirm enrolment and obtain the basic-salary figure.

### T2-3 -- Casual labour vs regular employment

**Trigger:** short-term or irregular engagement.
**Issue:** casual labour is taxed at flat 15%; RSSB applicability is case-specific.
**Action:** confirm engagement nature; flag RSSB registration question.

### T2-4 -- Expatriate / KIFC foreign-income exemption

**Trigger:** non-resident or KIFC-licensed taxpayer with foreign-sourced income.
**Issue:** the 5-year KIFC PIT exemption on foreign income is licence- and source-dependent.
**Action:** escalate; do not auto-apply the exemption.

### T2-5 -- Arrears, interest and penalties

**Trigger:** unpaid PAYE/RSSB from prior periods.
**Issue:** interest 0.5%--1.5%/month (capped at 100% of annual tax) plus 5%/10%/30% administrative fines and a possible 60% non-declaration penalty.
**Action:** do not estimate; request an RRA statement; escalate.

### T2-6 -- Future-year pension step-ups

**Trigger:** computation requested for 2027 onward.
**Issue:** scheduled 7%--10% step-ups are unconfirmed at primary source.
**Action:** flag; confirm against the RSSB ministerial order before applying.

## Section 9 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How Rwanda payroll remittances appear

**Bank of Kigali (BK):**
- Description: "RRA TAX", "RRA E-TAX", "PAYE", "RSSB CONTRIB", "RSSB PENSION"
- Timing: around the 10th (medical) and by the 15th (unified declaration) of the following month
- Amount: the monthly PAYE + RSSB total per the declaration

**BPR / Equity Bank Rwanda / I&M Bank Rwanda:**
- Description: "RWANDA REVENUE", "RRA", "RSSB", "SOCIAL SECURITY", "MUTUELLE / CBHI"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Mobile money (MoMo / Airtel Money):**
- Description: "RRA PAYMENT", "RSSB"
- Used by small employers to settle via the portal

**Key identification tips:**
1. RRA and RSSB remittances are outgoing (DEBIT), recurring monthly.
2. "RRA / E-TAX / MyRRA / UMUSORO" = tax (PAYE). "RSSB / PENSION / RAMA / CBHI / MUTUELLE" = social contributions.
3. Inbound "RSSB PENSION" or "MATERNITY BENEFIT" credits are benefits received, not contributions paid.
4. Irregular lump sums referencing "ARREARS / INTEREST / FINE" may include penalties under Tax Procedures Law No. 020/2023 -- flag for reviewer.

## Section 10 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no payroll detail:

1. **Scan for RRA and RSSB debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 4 patterns.
2. **Separate tax from contributions** -- "RRA / E-TAX / PAYE / UMUSORO" = PAYE; "RSSB / PENSION / RAMA / CBHI / MUTUELLE" = social contributions.
3. **Sum the monthly remittances** to estimate total payroll cost; note that a single unified debit may combine PAYE + RSSB.
4. **Do not reverse-engineer individual salaries** from a combined debit without the declaration -- the differing bases (gross / gross-excl-transport / net / basic) make this unreliable.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank statement totals only. Gross/basic/transport split, residency, and RAMA enrolment have not been verified. Reviewer must confirm before relying on the monthly declaration."

### Filing exemptions (no annual individual return required)

- Annual turnover below RWF 2 million; or
- Only employment income (PAYE is final); or
- Only investment income subject to final WHT; or
- Non-residents with Rwandan WHT income.

Record retention: **10 years**; returns auditable for **5 years**. Source: PwC Rwanda -- Tax administration (https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/rwanda/individual/tax-administration).

### Minimum wage

**No enforceable national minimum wage.** The 1974 statutory rate is obsolete; effective floors are set by sector/collective agreement. A new statutory minimum (reportedly ~RWF 60,000/month) has been discussed but not implemented as of 2025. [RESEARCH GAP -- no gazetted statutory rate; secondary HR/payroll guides only; reviewer to confirm.]

### Pension phased increases (scheduled, indicative)

| Effective | Employee | Employer | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Jan 2025 (firm) | 6% | 6% | 12% |
| 1 Jan 2027 | 7% | 7% | 14% |
| 1 Jan 2028 | 8% | 8% | 16% |
| 1 Jan 2029 | 9% | 9% | 18% |
| 1 Jan 2030 | 10% | 10% | 20% |

### Test suite

**Test 1 -- PAYE at top band.** Taxable base RWF 468,590. PAYE = 24,000 + 0.30 × (468,590 − 200,000) = 24,000 + 80,577 = **104,577**.

**Test 2 -- PAYE in the 20% band.** Taxable base RWF 150,000. PAYE = 4,000 + 0.20 × (150,000 − 100,000) = 4,000 + 10,000 = **14,000**.

**Test 3 -- PAYE in the 10% band.** Taxable base RWF 90,000. PAYE = 0.10 × (90,000 − 60,000) = **3,000**.

**Test 4 -- Below threshold.** Taxable base RWF 55,000 → **PAYE = 0**.

**Test 5 -- Casual labour.** Payment RWF 80,000 at flat 15% → PAYE = **12,000**.

**Test 6 -- Pension contribution.** Gross RWF 500,000 → pension EE 6% = **30,000**; pension ER 6% = **30,000**; total = **60,000**.

**Test 7 -- Maternity base excludes transport.** Gross RWF 500,000 incl. transport RWF 30,000 → maternity EE 0.3% × 470,000 = **1,410**.

**Test 8 -- CBHIS on net.** From Example 1: net base 364,013 → CBHIS EE 0.5% = **1,820.07**.

**Test 9 -- Medical on basic (if enrolled).** Basic salary RWF 400,000 → medical EE 7.5% = **30,000**; medical ER 7.5% = **30,000**; total = **60,000**.

**Test 10 -- Full net pay reconciliation (Example 1, not RAMA-enrolled).** 500,000 − 30,000 (pension) − 1,410 (maternity) − 104,577 (PAYE) − 1,820.07 (CBHIS) = **362,192.93**.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply a single contribution base across all schemes -- pension/occ.hazards use gross, maternity uses gross-excl-transport, CBHIS uses net, medical uses basic.
- NEVER deduct occupational hazards (2%) from the employee -- it is employer-only.
- NEVER compute the medical (RAMA) contribution on gross -- it is on **basic** salary.
- NEVER apply the medical scheme without confirming enrolment (mandatory only for civil servants; private opt-in needs ≥7 employees).
- NEVER use the progressive brackets for casual labour -- it is a flat 15%.
- NEVER apply the 2027--2030 pension step-ups without reviewer confirmation -- they are unconfirmed at primary source.
- NEVER quote a Rwandan national minimum wage as a hard figure -- there is no enforceable gazetted rate.
- NEVER auto-apply the KIFC foreign-income exemption -- it is licence- and source-specific; escalate.
- NEVER estimate arrears, interest or penalties without an RRA/RSSB statement -- escalate to a reviewer.
- NEVER present these figures as definitive -- label them estimated and direct the client to their RRA/RSSB declaration.
