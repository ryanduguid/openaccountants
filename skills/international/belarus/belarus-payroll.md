# Belarus Payroll Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 -- research-verified. Figures below are sourced from the Official Internet Portal of the President of the Republic of Belarus (president.gov.by tax-legislation release), the Ministry of Taxes and Duties (MNS / nalog.gov.by), the State Social Protection Fund (FSZN / ssf.gov.by), Belgosstrakh (bgs.by), and cross-checked against established law-firm guides (GSL, Chandrawat & Partners) and specialist Belarusian payroll providers (Spex.by, EOR.by, Recruitment.by, Asanify). NOT yet signed off by a licensed Belarusian accountant (бухгалтер) or auditor. Treat every computation as an estimate pending professional review. All amounts are in Belarusian rubles (BYN / Br).**

> **Provenance caveat (read before relying on any figure).** PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries no longer maintains a standalone Belarus territory page (URLs 404), and the official ssf.gov.by page timed out on direct fetch, so the FSZN 28%/6% split and the quarterly Form 4-fund / PU-3 reporting were confirmed via secondary Belarusian sources rather than scraped from the authority. Penalty/peni figures are NOT sourced from an authority page and are flagged low-confidence. Standard-deduction amounts (192/56/107/272 BYN) and the minimum wage (726 BYN) are 2025 figures indexed annually -- confirm against the gazetted decree. **Tax-year precision: the 25% surtax over BYN 220,000 is the 2025 rule; the President's release describes a BYN 350,000 threshold and an added 30% band as effective 2026 -- do NOT mix these.**

### The single most important Belarus facts

> **1. Income tax is a FLAT 13%, withheld by the employer as tax agent.** It is charged on the PIT base = gross income MINUS the employee's applicable standard/child/category deductions. The employee's 1% FSZN contribution is NOT a deduction from the PIT base (unlike some other CIS systems). (EOR.by; Tax Code arts. 199--214)
>
> **2. The 25% high-income surtax is NOT a monthly payroll item.** For 2025 it applies only to the portion of an individual's ANNUAL income exceeding BYN 220,000, and it is assessed by the tax authority on the basis of the individual's annual declaration filed by 31 March of the following year -- the employer does NOT withhold it monthly. (eor.by; reform.news)
>
> **3. The employer on-cost is dominated by FSZN 34% + Belgosstrakh ~0.6%.** FSZN = 28% pension + 6% social on the full gross salary with no general ceiling for standard employers; Belgosstrakh accident insurance is a standard 0.6% (0.1% for budget organisations; ~0.1%--0.9% by professional-risk class). The employee bears only 13% PIT + 1% FSZN = 14%. (recruiting.by; spex.by; eor.by; bgs.by)

---

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (подоходный налог / PIT)

The employer withholds income tax as the **tax agent** at the moment income is paid out. Belarus operates a **single flat rate** for employment income with no marital-status tables.

### Flat Income Tax Rate (2025)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Income tax rate on employment income | **13%** (flat) (president.gov.by; eor.by) |
| Tax base | Gross income **minus** the employee's applicable standard / child / category deductions (the BYN amounts in Section 5) (EOR.by; Tax Code art. 209) |
| High-income surtax (2025) | **25%** on the portion of ANNUAL income over **BYN 220,000** -- assessed via the individual's annual declaration, NOT withheld monthly (eor.by; reform.news) |
| 2026 forward change (do NOT apply to 2025) | Threshold rises to **BYN 350,000** and a **30%** top band is added for ultra-high incomes, effective 2026 (president.gov.by) |
| Dividends | 13% (and 25% on high amounts); 6% if no profit distributed for 3 consecutive years; 0% if none for 5 years (GSL) **[RESEARCH GAP -- 6%/0% special rates from a 2024 GSL snapshot; reviewer to re-verify for 2025]** |

### Withholding computation method

There are no FS4-style status categories or cumulative projection. The monthly withholding is mechanically simple:

```
PIT_base = gross_income - applicable_deductions   # standard 192 (income-tested) + per-child 56/107 + category 272
PIT      = PIT_base x 13%
```

The 13% is withheld by the employer-as-tax-agent at payout. **The 25% surtax is never part of monthly withholding.** If an employee's annualised income looks set to exceed BYN 220,000, flag it for the annual declaration -- do not increase the monthly withholding.

> **Note on the surtax mechanism.** Because the flat 13% has already been withheld on the full salary, the additional liability assessed on the annual declaration for income over BYN 220,000 is the **incremental** 12% (25% − 13%) on the excess portion -- see Worked Example 4. (eor.by; reform.news)

---

## Section 3 -- Social, Pension and Accident Contributions -- Tables (2025)

Contributions are computed on the **full gross salary**. For standard (non-HTP, non-budget) employers there is **no general upper ceiling** in 2025; the minimum contribution base is tied to the minimum wage for periods worked. (eor.by)

### 3.1 Standard employer (non-HTP, non-budget) -- the default case

| Contribution (Russian) | Employee | Employer | Total | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FSZN pension / retirement insurance (пенсионное страхование) | 1% | 28% | 29% | eor.by; recruiting.by |
| FSZN social insurance -- sickness, maternity, etc. (социальное страхование) | 0% | 6% | 6% | spex.by; chandrawatpartners.com |
| **FSZN subtotal** | **1%** | **34%** | **35%** | eor.by |
| Belgosstrakh -- accident & occupational-disease insurance (Белгосстрах) | 0% | 0.6% (standard) | 0.6% | spex.by; bgs.by |
| **TOTAL social/accident on-cost** | **1%** | **34.6%** | **35.6%** | (derived) |

**Arithmetic check (component rows sum to the subtotals/total):**
- FSZN employer column: pension 28% + social 6% = **34%** ✓
- FSZN employee column: 1% + 0% = **1%** ✓
- FSZN total: 34% + 1% = **35%** ✓
- Belgosstrakh employer column: **0.6%** (standard) ✓
- Employer grand total: 34% + 0.6% = **34.6%** ✓
- Combined (EE + ER): 1% + 34.6% = **35.6%** ✓

> The 1% employee FSZN is the **only** payroll contribution withheld from the employee; the employer's 34% FSZN and Belgosstrakh are paid on top of gross. The employee's total deduction from gross is therefore **13% PIT + 1% FSZN = 14%** before any PIT deductions are applied.

### 3.2 Belgosstrakh accident-insurance rate (employer-only)

| Policyholder type | Rate on gross payroll | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard / most policyholders | **0.6%** | spex.by; eor.by |
| Budget / state organisations | **0.1%** | spex.by; eor.by |
| Effective range by professional-risk class (discounts/surcharges) | **~0.1% -- 0.9%** | bgs.by |

Use 0.6% as the default for a standard private employer; use the policyholder's actual risk-class rate when known.

### 3.3 Contribution base -- floor and ceiling (2025)

| Threshold | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| General upper ceiling (standard employer) | **None** in 2025 -- FSZN on full gross | eor.by |
| Minimum contribution base | Tied to the **minimum wage** (BYN 726/month in 2025) for periods worked | eor.by |
| HTP-resident special base | FSZN may be computed on the **national average monthly wage** (Belstat) instead of full salary, capping high earners | recruitment.by |

> **HTP cap is a RESEARCH GAP for the exact figure.** The Belstat national average monthly wage used as the HTP cap is not supplied in the research data. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the current Belstat national average monthly wage used as the HTP FSZN base.]**

### 3.4 Other regimes (reference only -- NOT employer payroll)

| Regime | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Self-employed / individual entrepreneurs (self-pay) | **35%** = 29% pension + 6% social | self-declared income, min tied to minimum wage | chandrawatpartners.com; spex.by |
| HTP residents (employer/employee) | same **34% / 1%** rates | FSZN base may be the Belstat national average wage | recruitment.by |

## Section 4 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is ambiguous, apply the conservative default below and flag it for the reviewer.

| Ambiguity | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Belgosstrakh risk-class rate unknown | Use the standard **0.6%** -> employer on-cost 34.6% | The 0.1% rate is budget-org only; the ~0.1%--0.9% band is risk-class dependent (bgs.by) |
| Standard BYN 192 deduction -- eligibility unclear | Do **NOT** apply it unless monthly income ≤ BYN 1,164 is confirmed | The deduction is only available below the BYN 1,164 monthly ceiling, and most employees earn above it (eor.by) |
| Employer total on-cost (quick estimate) | **~34.6% of gross** (34% FSZN + 0.6% Belgosstrakh) for a standard non-HTP, non-budget employer | Use the 0.6% standard rate unless the risk class is known |
| Employee deduction from gross (quick estimate) | **14% of gross** (13% PIT + 1% FSZN) before any standard/child deductions | Most employees earn above BYN 1,164/month so the BYN 192 standard deduction often does not apply |
| High-income 25% surtax | Do **NOT** apply in monthly withholding; flag for annual declaration if annual income > BYN 220,000 | It is assessed by the tax authority on the annual return, not withheld by the employer (eor.by) |
| HTP-resident FSZN base unknown | Default to FSZN on **full gross** (standard treatment) and flag the HTP cap for the reviewer | The Belstat average-wage cap requires the exact figure, which is a RESEARCH GAP |
| 2026 vs 2025 threshold | Use the **BYN 220,000 / 25%** 2025 rule for 2025 runs; flag the BYN 350,000 / 30% rule as a 2026-only forward change | The President's release dates the new band to 2026 (president.gov.by) |

## Section 5 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- gross monthly remuneration and confirmation that the worker is an employee (not a self-employed individual entrepreneur). Without a gross figure, STOP.

**Recommended** -- the employer's Belgosstrakh professional-risk class (to fix the 0.1%--0.9% rate), whether the employer is a High-Tech Park resident, the number of qualifying children/dependents (for the BYN 56/107 deductions), and whether monthly income is below BYN 1,164 (for the BYN 192 standard deduction).

**Ideal** -- payslip showing the FSZN and PIT split, MNS confirmation of withheld PIT remitted, the latest Form 4-fund (4-фонд) and PU-3 (ПУ-3) personalised records, the employee's residency status, and -- for high earners -- the annualised income projection against the BYN 220,000 threshold.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-BY-PAY-1 -- Gross figure unknown.** *Trigger:* no gross monthly remuneration provided. *Message:* "A gross monthly remuneration is mandatory. PIT (13%) is charged on gross minus applicable deductions, and FSZN/Belgosstrakh are percentages of gross. Cannot proceed without the gross figure."

**R-BY-PAY-2 -- Payroll arrears / late-payment quantification.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid contributions or withheld PIT from prior periods and wants the arrears + interest quantified. *Message:* "Overdue taxes/contributions accrue penalty interest (peni) based on the National Bank refinancing rate, plus administrative fines for late/incorrect filing. The exact 2025 peni formula is NOT confirmed from an authority page **[RESEARCH GAP]**. Escalate to a Belarus-qualified accountant -- do not estimate arrears."

**R-BY-PAY-3 -- High-income annual declaration / 25% surtax computation.** *Trigger:* client wants the exact 25% surtax computed and remitted through payroll. *Message:* "The 25% surtax on annual income over BYN 220,000 is NOT withheld monthly by the employer -- it is assessed by the tax authority on the individual's annual declaration filed by 31 March of the following year. Flag the exposure; do not add it to monthly withholding."

**R-BY-PAY-4 -- Cross-border / EAEU / non-resident coordination.** *Trigger:* employee works across EAEU states, is a non-resident, or splits duties internationally. *Message:* "Cross-border and EAEU social-security/PIT coordination and non-resident rates are outside the scope of this skill. Escalate to a Belarus-qualified accountant."

**R-BY-PAY-5 -- Self-employed / individual entrepreneur contributions.** *Trigger:* the worker is a self-employed individual entrepreneur (ИП), not an employee. *Message:* "This skill covers EMPLOYED persons (employer is the tax agent and withholds PIT + the 1% FSZN, and pays 34% FSZN on top). Self-employed/individual-entrepreneur FSZN is self-paid at 35% (29% pension + 6% social) on declared income and is out of scope. Escalate to a Belarus-qualified accountant."

**R-BY-PAY-6 -- Foreign-worker salary-threshold compliance.** *Trigger:* hiring a foreign national from 1 Nov 2025. *Message:* "From 1 November 2025 foreign employees must earn at least BYN 3,630/month (= 5x minimum wage) under a special work permit / temporary residence permit, or BYN 2,100/month for other categories, and must be on local BYN payroll (Nairametrics, citing Fragomen). Confirm the category and threshold with an immigration adviser before running payroll."

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples

Realistic Minsk-based payroll scenarios for a hypothetical standard (non-HTP, non-budget) employer at the standard 0.6% Belgosstrakh class, unless stated. Currency is BYN. Every figure below is recomputed end-to-end. Unless stated, the employee earns above BYN 1,164/month, so the BYN 192 standard deduction does NOT apply and no children are claimed.

### Example 1 -- Standard salary above the deduction ceiling (gross BYN 2,000)

**Input line:**
`25.05.2025 ; ФСЗН ВЗНОСЫ 04/2025 ; DEBIT ; ФСЗН + ПОДОХОДНЫЙ ; -960.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BYN 2,000 exceeds BYN 1,164, so no standard deduction; no children. PIT base = full gross.
- PIT = 13% × 2,000 = **BYN 260.00**
- Employee FSZN = 1% × 2,000 = **BYN 20.00**
- **Net pay** = 2,000 − 260.00 − 20.00 = **BYN 1,720.00**
- Employer FSZN = 34% × 2,000 = **BYN 680.00**
- Belgosstrakh = 0.6% × 2,000 = **BYN 12.00**
- Employer on-cost = 680.00 + 12.00 = **BYN 692.00**; total cost to employer = 2,000 + 692.00 = **BYN 2,692.00**

The combined remittance shown on the bank line above is employee FSZN 20.00 + PIT 260.00 + employer FSZN 680.00 = **BYN 960.00** to MNS/FSZN; Belgosstrakh 12.00 is paid separately on the Belgosstrakh schedule.

**Classification:** Net wage BYN 1,720.00 to employee; FSZN + PIT BYN 960.00 by the 22nd of the following month; employer-share FSZN BYN 680.00 and Belgosstrakh BYN 12.00 are deductible payroll on-costs.

### Example 2 -- Minimum-wage employee, standard deduction applies (gross BYN 726)

**Input line:**
`25.06.2025 ; ЗАРПЛАТА МАЙ 2025 ; DEBIT ; МИН ЗП ; -649.32 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BYN 726 (the 2025 statutory minimum wage) is below BYN 1,164, so the BYN 192 standard deduction applies; no children.
- PIT base = 726 − 192 = BYN 534.00; PIT = 13% × 534.00 = **BYN 69.42**
- Employee FSZN = 1% × 726 = **BYN 7.26**
- **Net pay** = 726 − 69.42 − 7.26 = **BYN 649.32**
- Employer FSZN = 34% × 726 = **BYN 246.84**
- Belgosstrakh = 0.6% × 726 = **BYN 4.36** (726 × 0.006 = 4.356, rounded)

**Classification:** Net wage BYN 649.32. The standard deduction reduces PIT only because income is under the BYN 1,164 ceiling; if income rises above it in any month the BYN 192 falls away.

### Example 3 -- Low-paid parent with one child (gross BYN 1,000, 1 child)

**Input line:**
`25.07.2025 ; ЗАРПЛАТА ИЮНЬ 2025 ; DEBIT ; ЗП + ДЕТСКИЙ ВЫЧЕТ ; -892.24 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BYN 1,000 is below BYN 1,164, so the BYN 192 standard deduction applies; plus one child under 18 at BYN 56.
- Deductions = 192 + 56 = BYN 248.00
- PIT base = 1,000 − 248.00 = BYN 752.00; PIT = 13% × 752.00 = **BYN 97.76**
- Employee FSZN = 1% × 1,000 = **BYN 10.00**
- **Net pay** = 1,000 − 97.76 − 10.00 = **BYN 892.24**
- Employer FSZN = 34% × 1,000 = **BYN 340.00**; Belgosstrakh = 0.6% × 1,000 = **BYN 6.00**

**Classification:** Net wage BYN 892.24. Child deduction stacks on the standard deduction. A parent of 2+ children, a single parent, or a guardian would use the enhanced BYN 107 per child instead of BYN 56.

### Example 4 -- High earner triggering the annual 25% surtax (gross BYN 20,000/month)

**Input line:**
`25.05.2025 ; ФСЗН + ПОДОХОДНЫЙ 04/2025 ; DEBIT ; ВЫСОКАЯ ЗП ; -9,600.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning -- monthly withholding only:**
Gross BYN 20,000/month, annualised BYN 240,000 (> BYN 220,000). The employer withholds ONLY the flat 13% monthly; there is no FSZN ceiling for a standard employer.
- PIT withheld = 13% × 20,000 = **BYN 2,600.00**
- Employee FSZN = 1% × 20,000 = **BYN 200.00**
- **Net pay (monthly, before surtax)** = 20,000 − 2,600.00 − 200.00 = **BYN 17,200.00**
- Employer FSZN = 34% × 20,000 = **BYN 6,800.00**; Belgosstrakh = 0.6% × 20,000 = **BYN 120.00**
- Combined monthly MNS/FSZN remittance = 200.00 + 2,600.00 + 6,800.00 = **BYN 9,600.00**.

**Reasoning -- annual surtax (NOT a payroll item):**
Annual income BYN 240,000; excess over BYN 220,000 = BYN 20,000. The 25% rate applies to that excess. Because the flat 13% was already withheld on the whole salary, the **incremental** liability assessed on the individual's annual declaration is (25% − 13%) × 20,000 = 12% × 20,000 = **BYN 2,400.00**, due via the declaration filed by 31 March of the following year. (eor.by; reform.news)

**Classification:** Run monthly payroll at the flat 13% only. Flag the high earner for the annual declaration; do NOT add the BYN 2,400.00 to monthly withholding. (For 2026 onward the threshold becomes BYN 350,000 with a 30% top band -- do not apply to 2025.)

### Example 5 -- High-Tech Park (HTP) resident, FSZN base capped (gross BYN 10,000)

**Input line:**
`25.06.2025 ; ФСЗН ПВТ 05/2025 ; DEBIT ; HTP CAPPED BASE ; -1,300.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
HTP residents apply the same 13% PIT and the same 34%/1% FSZN rates, but FSZN may be computed on the **national average monthly wage** (Belstat) rather than the full BYN 10,000 salary. (recruitment.by)
- PIT (no cap) = 13% × 10,000 = **BYN 1,300.00** (the bank line above shows PIT; FSZN is on the capped base)
- Employee FSZN = 1% × [Belstat national average wage] -- **[RESEARCH GAP -- the Belstat average-wage cap figure is not in the research data; reviewer to supply]**
- Employer FSZN = 34% × [Belstat national average wage] -- **[RESEARCH GAP]**
- Belgosstrakh = 0.6% × 10,000 = **BYN 60.00** (Belgosstrakh follows full gross unless told otherwise -- flag for reviewer)

**Classification:** PIT is unaffected by HTP status; only the FSZN base is capped at the national average wage for the salary above it. The cap figure must be confirmed before the FSZN amounts can be finalised.

### Example 6 -- Budget organisation, reduced Belgosstrakh rate (gross BYN 2,000, 0.1% class)

**Input line:**
`25.05.2025 ; БЕЛГОССТРАХ БЮДЖ 04/2025 ; DEBIT ; СТРАХ 0.1% ; -2.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Same employee as Example 1 (gross BYN 2,000) but a budget/state organisation, so Belgosstrakh is 0.1% instead of 0.6%.
- PIT = **BYN 260.00** (unchanged); Employee FSZN = **BYN 20.00** (unchanged); Net pay = **BYN 1,720.00** (unchanged)
- Employer FSZN = 34% × 2,000 = **BYN 680.00** (unchanged)
- Belgosstrakh = 0.1% × 2,000 = **BYN 2.00** (vs BYN 12.00 at 0.6%)
- Employer on-cost = 680.00 + 2.00 = **BYN 682.00**

**Classification:** Only the Belgosstrakh on-cost changes; the employee net pay is identical to Example 1. Use 0.1% ONLY for budget/state organisations.

## Section 8 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic)

Apply exactly as written when inputs are clear.

### Rule 1 -- Income tax is a flat 13% on the deduction-adjusted base

```
PIT_base = gross_income - applicable_deductions   # standard 192 (income-tested) + per-child 56/107 + category 272
PIT      = PIT_base x 13%
```
No brackets, no marital-status tables. The employer withholds at payout as the tax agent. (president.gov.by; eor.by)

### Rule 2 -- FSZN contribution formula (standard employer)

```
fszn_base            = gross_income            # no general ceiling for standard employers in 2025
employee_fszn        = fszn_base x 1%
employer_fszn        = fszn_base x 34%          # 28% pension + 6% social
belgosstrakh         = gross_income x 0.6%      # standard; 0.1% budget org; 0.1%–0.9% by risk class
employer_on_cost     = employer_fszn + belgosstrakh   # = 34.6% at the 0.6% rate
```
(eor.by; recruiting.by; spex.by; bgs.by)

### Rule 3 -- The employee bears only 14% of gross

The employee's total deduction from gross is 13% PIT + 1% FSZN = 14% (before any PIT deductions). Everything else is employer on-cost. (eor.by)

### Rule 4 -- Standard deduction is income-tested

The BYN 192/month standard deduction applies ONLY if monthly income ≤ BYN 1,164. Above that, it falls away. Child deductions (BYN 56, or enhanced BYN 107) and the BYN 272 category deduction are not subject to the BYN 1,164 standard-deduction ceiling but have their own eligibility rules. (eor.by; Tax Code art. 209)

### Rule 5 -- The 25% surtax is annual, not monthly

For 2025, income over BYN 220,000/year bears 25% on the excess, assessed on the individual's annual declaration filed by 31 March of the following year. The employer NEVER withholds it monthly; the incremental liability after the flat 13% is (25% − 13%) × excess. (eor.by; reform.news)

### Rule 6 -- Belgosstrakh is employer-only

Compulsory accident/occupational-disease insurance (standard 0.6%; 0.1% budget org; ~0.1%--0.9% by risk class) is paid ENTIRELY by the employer and is never withheld from the employee. (spex.by; bgs.by)

### Rule 7 -- Monthly remittance and deadline

Withheld PIT and FSZN/Belgosstrakh contributions are due monthly, generally by the **22nd of the month following salary payment**; monthly tax reports by the **20th of the following month**. The Tax Code rule is that the tax agent transfers withheld PIT no later than the day of payout from the bank (or next day), with the 22nd as a backstop. (asanify.com; by.icalculator.com) **[RESEARCH GAP -- confirm the exact PIT remittance timing against Tax Code art. 216]**

### Rule 8 -- Forms

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Income tax (PIT) remittance | Employer (tax agent) transfers withheld 13% PIT to the budget | At payout; not later than the 22nd of the following month where withholding is deferred | asanify.com; by.icalculator.com |
| FSZN Form 4-fund (4-фонд) + PU-3 (ПУ-3) personalised records | Quarterly report to the FSZN on accrued/paid contributions and personalised employee data | Contributions paid monthly by the 22nd (or by payday); quarterly 4-fund report generally by the 20th of the month after the quarter | ssf.gov.by; asanify.com |
| Annual individual income declaration (high earners) | Individual declares income over BYN 220,000 and pays the 25% surtax on the excess | 31 March of the year following the reporting year | eor.by |
| Employer annual income/withholding report to MNS | Report of employee income and tax withheld | By March of the following year (annual reconciliation) | rivermate.com; asanify.com |
| Belgosstrakh accident-insurance reporting | Mandatory occupational accident/disease premiums and reporting; employer registers with Belgosstrakh | Per Belgosstrakh schedule (monthly/quarterly) | bgs.by |

### Rule 9 -- Minimum wage and minimum contribution base

The 2025 statutory minimum wage is **BYN 726/month** (was BYN 626 in 2024; rises to BYN 858 in 2026); hourly equivalent ≈ BYN 4.54. The minimum FSZN contribution base is tied to the minimum wage for periods worked. (wageindicator.org; belarusvc.com; eor.by)

### Rule 10 -- Employer registration / foreign workers

Employers must register with the MNS, the FSZN, and Belgosstrakh before hiring. From 1 November 2025, foreign employees must earn at least BYN 3,630/month (= 5x minimum wage) under a special work permit / temporary residence permit, or BYN 2,100/month for other categories, and be on local BYN payroll. (asanify.com; nairametrics.com)

## Section 11 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

References commonly appear in Cyrillic; some banks transliterate to Latin. All amounts are in BYN.

| Belarusian/Russian term | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Зарплата / Оплата труда | Zarplata / Oplata truda | Salary / wage |
| Подоходный налог | Podokhodny nalog | Personal income tax (flat 13%) |
| ФСЗН (Фонд социальной защиты населения) | FSZN | State Social Protection Fund |
| Пенсионное страхование | Pensionnoe strakhovanie | Pension (retirement) insurance (28% ER / 1% EE) |
| Социальное страхование | Sotsialnoe strakhovanie | Social insurance -- sickness/maternity (6% ER) |
| Белгосстрах | Belgosstrakh | Accident/occupational-disease insurance (employer-only) |
| Минимальная заработная плата (МЗП) | Minimalnaya zarabotnaya plata (MZP) | Minimum wage |
| Стандартный вычет | Standartny vychet | Standard PIT deduction (BYN 192) |
| Детский вычет | Detskiy vychet | Child deduction (BYN 56 / enhanced 107) |
| Аванс | Avans | Salary advance |
| Окончательный расчёт | Okonchatelny raschyot | Final settlement |
| Форма 4-фонд / ПУ-3 | Forma 4-fund / PU-3 | FSZN quarterly report / personalised records |
| Пеня | Penya (peni) | Penalty interest on overdue tax/contributions |

**Identification tips:**
1. PIT and FSZN debits are outgoing (DEBIT) to MNS/FSZN and recur monthly around the 22nd.
2. A single MNS/FSZN debit may bundle employee FSZN + employer FSZN + the 13% PIT -- split by reference (ФСЗН = contributions; ПОДОХОДНЫЙ = income tax).
3. Belgosstrakh is a separate, much smaller debit (~0.6% of payroll) on its own schedule.
4. Net wage to the employee (ЗАРПЛАТА outgoing) is separate from the MNS/FSZN remittance and is net of the 14% employee burden (after deductions).
5. Do not confuse outgoing contribution debits with incoming FSZN benefit credits (ПЕНСИЯ pension, ПОСОБИЕ benefit).
6. The 25% surtax never appears in monthly payroll -- it is settled via the individual's annual declaration.

---

## Section 12 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for MNS/FSZN debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 6 patterns (ФСЗН / ПОДОХОДНЫЙ / БЕЛГОССТРАХ).
2. **Separate PIT from contributions** -- tag ФСЗН/ПЕНСИОННЫЕ as FSZN contributions; tag ПОДОХОДНЫЙ as the 13% PIT; tag БЕЛГОССТРАХ as accident insurance.
3. **Reverse-engineer the base** -- for an employer FSZN remittance, divide the FSZN amount by the combined 35% (employer 34% + employee 1%) to estimate gross payroll; cross-check against the 13% PIT and the ~0.6% Belgosstrakh.
4. **Match the net wage** -- a ЗАРПЛАТА outgoing equals gross minus the 13% PIT (on the deduction-adjusted base) minus 1% employee FSZN.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank-statement amounts only. Employment status, Belgosstrakh risk class, HTP status, deduction eligibility, and any high-income annual-declaration exposure have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing Form 4-fund / PU-3."

### Calculation summary (2025, BYN; standard employer; 0.6% Belgosstrakh; no children unless noted)

| Gross monthly | Deductions | PIT base | PIT (13%) | Employee FSZN (1%) | Net pay | Employer FSZN (34%) | Belgosstrakh (0.6%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

### Wider entity context (informational, not payroll)

Corporate income tax is 20% standard (25% where annual profit exceeds BYN 25,000,000) and VAT is 20% standard (10%/0% reduced). (GSL) **[RESEARCH GAP -- BYN 25m corporate 25% band and dividend special rates from a 2024 GSL snapshot; re-verify for 2025/2026]**

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Employee, gross BYN 726 (min wage), no children, income ≤ 1,164 so BYN 192 standard deduction applies. -> PIT base = 534.00; PIT = BYN 69.42; employee FSZN = BYN 7.26; net = BYN 649.32; employer FSZN = BYN 246.84; Belgosstrakh 0.6% = BYN 4.36.

**Test 2:** Employee, gross BYN 1,000, one child, income ≤ 1,164 (deductions 192 + 56 = 248). -> PIT base = 752.00; PIT = BYN 97.76; employee FSZN = BYN 10.00; net = BYN 892.24; employer FSZN = BYN 340.00; Belgosstrakh = BYN 6.00.

**Test 3:** Employee, gross BYN 2,000, no deductions (above the 1,164 ceiling). -> PIT base = 2,000.00; PIT = BYN 260.00; employee FSZN = BYN 20.00; net = BYN 1,720.00; employer FSZN = BYN 680.00; Belgosstrakh = BYN 12.00. Employer total cost = BYN 2,692.00.

**Test 4:** High earner, gross BYN 20,000/month (annual 240,000). -> Monthly: PIT 13% = BYN 2,600.00; employee FSZN = BYN 200.00; net = BYN 17,200.00; employer FSZN = BYN 6,800.00; Belgosstrakh = BYN 120.00. Annual surtax (NOT monthly): excess 20,000 over 220,000; incremental 12% = BYN 2,400.00 via the 31 March annual declaration.

**Test 5:** Same as Test 3 but a budget organisation (Belgosstrakh 0.1%). -> Employee figures unchanged (net BYN 1,720.00); Belgosstrakh = 0.1% × 2,000 = BYN 2.00; employer on-cost = 680.00 + 2.00 = BYN 682.00.

**Test 6:** HTP resident, gross BYN 10,000. -> PIT (uncapped) = 13% × 10,000 = BYN 1,300.00; FSZN base capped at the Belstat national average wage (figure not supplied). Flag for reviewer. **[RESEARCH GAP -- Belstat average-wage cap.]**

**Test 7:** Foreign hire from 1 Nov 2025 on a special work permit. -> Must earn ≥ BYN 3,630/month (5x min wage) and be on local BYN payroll; otherwise out of compliance (refusal R-BY-PAY-6). Standard 13% PIT + FSZN apply once on payroll.

**Test 8:** Worker is a self-employed individual entrepreneur, not an employee. -> Out of scope; self-pays FSZN at 35% (29% pension + 6% social) on declared income; route per refusal R-BY-PAY-5.

---

## Section 14 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (13% PIT + FSZN + Belgosstrakh) | **This skill (belarus-payroll.md)** |
| Belarus VAT (NDS) returns | belarus-vat.md |
| Self-employed / individual-entrepreneur contributions | (out of scope -- escalate to a qualified accountant) |
| High-income annual income declaration (> BYN 220,000) | (individual annual return -- escalate; not payroll) |

### Key handoff points

- **Payroll -> Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and the employer's 34% FSZN + Belgosstrakh are expenses; the 13% PIT and the 1% employee FSZN are liabilities until remitted to MNS/FSZN.
- **Payroll -> Income Tax:** The employer's annual income/withholding report feeds the individual's record; high earners (> BYN 220,000) must file their own annual declaration by 31 March for the 25% surtax on the excess.
- **Payroll -> VAT:** Independent of NDS; salaries are outside the scope of VAT.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER withhold the 25% high-income surtax through monthly payroll -- it is assessed on the individual's annual declaration (filed by 31 March) for income over BYN 220,000 in 2025
- NEVER apply the 2026 BYN 350,000 threshold or 30% top band to 2025 payroll -- they are a forward change effective 2026
- NEVER apply the BYN 192 standard deduction when monthly income exceeds BYN 1,164 -- it is income-tested
- NEVER subtract the 1% employee FSZN from the PIT base -- the PIT base is gross minus the BYN standard/child/category deductions, not minus FSZN
- NEVER withhold the employer's 34% FSZN or the Belgosstrakh premium from the employee -- only the 1% FSZN and 13% PIT come out of the employee's pay
- NEVER use the 0.1% Belgosstrakh rate for a private employer -- 0.1% is for budget/state organisations; the standard private rate is 0.6%
- NEVER assume an FSZN ceiling for a standard employer in 2025 -- contributions are on full gross (only HTP residents may cap the base at the Belstat average wage)
- NEVER treat self-employed/individual-entrepreneur FSZN (35%, self-paid) as employer payroll
- NEVER miss the 22nd-of-following-month remittance deadline for PIT and FSZN, or the quarterly Form 4-fund / PU-3 -- peni and fines apply
- NEVER quantify payroll arrears, peni, or fines without an MNS/FSZN statement -- the exact 2025 formula is unconfirmed; escalate to a qualified accountant
- NEVER treat the 6%/0% dividend rates or the BYN 25m corporate band as confirmed 2025 figures -- they are from a 2024 snapshot and must be re-verified
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Belarusian accountant
