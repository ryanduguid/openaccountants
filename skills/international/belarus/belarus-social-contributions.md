# Belarus Social Insurance Contributions (FSZN) + Payroll PIT -- Skill v0.1

**Confidence: MEDIUM.** Belarus is NOT covered by the PwC / Deloitte / EY / KPMG Worldwide Tax Summaries (taxsummaries.pwc.com/belarus returns 404). Figures below rely on the official President of Belarus portal (president.gov.by), the official Social Protection Fund portal (ssf.gov.by), the Lloyds/Standard Bank International Trade Portal, Bloomberg Tax, and specialist Belarusian payroll/EOR providers (eor.by, spex.by, globalization-partners). Several figures carry an explicit **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** marker and MUST be verified against the Russian-language Tax Code (Налоговый кодекс) and current FSZN regulations before any filing. Belarus is also under extensive international sanctions affecting banking/payment practicalities (not the statutory rates).

## Section 1 -- Quick reference

**Read this whole section before computing or classifying anything.**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Republic of Belarus |
| Primary Legislation | Tax Code of the Republic of Belarus (Налоговый кодекс); Law No. 138-Z on social insurance + Decree/Law on mandatory FSZN contributions; Law on mandatory state social insurance against industrial accidents and occupational diseases (Belgosstrakh) |

**Contribution overview (per gross wage):**

| Contribution | Payer | Rate | Component |
|---|---|---|---|
| FSZN pension insurance | Employer | 28% | Part of 34% employer total |
| FSZN social insurance | Employer | 6% | Part of 34% employer total |
| FSZN pension insurance | Employee (withheld) | 1% | Employee share |
| **Total FSZN (employer + employee)** | **Combined** | **35%** | **34% + 1% = 35%** |
| Belgosstrakh accident insurance | Employer | 0.6% base | On top of FSZN; risk-class adjusted |

Arithmetic check: 28% + 6% = 34% employer; 34% + 1% employee = 35% combined. Belgosstrakh (0.6%) sits OUTSIDE the 35% FSZN total.

**Conservative defaults:**

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown whether HTP resident | Apply full-gross FSZN (34% employer + 1% employee) + 0.6% Belgosstrakh — do NOT assume the HTP base reduction |
| Unknown annual income vs PIT threshold | Use 13% PIT for all employment income unless annual income demonstrably exceeds the 25% threshold (BYN 220,000 for 2025 / BYN 350,000 for 2026) |
| Unknown Belgosstrakh risk class | Use 0.6% base premium |
| Unknown self-employed status | Use 35% (29% pension + 6% social) on at least the 12-minimum-wage annual floor |
| Unknown whether a debit is FSZN or PIT | Classify by reference text; if still ambiguous, flag for reviewer |
| Unknown payment date | Use the 20th-of-following-month outer limit (do not assume earlier compliance) |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- employment status (employee vs self-employed/IP), gross monthly remuneration in BYN, and the tax year (2025 vs 2026 changes the PIT scale and minimum wage).

**Recommended** -- whether the employer is a High Technology Park (HTP) resident, the annual cumulative income (to test the 25%/30% PIT thresholds), and the Belgosstrakh occupational risk class.

**Ideal** -- FSZN personalised account statements (ПУ forms), payroll register, prior-year annual tax return, and bank statements showing FSZN/Belgosstrakh/PIT remittances.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-BY-SSC-1 -- Annual increased-rate (25%/30%) PIT reconciliation.** *Trigger:* annual income approaches or exceeds the high-income threshold (BYN 220,000 in 2025; BYN 350,000 in 2026). *Message:* "The increased PIT rate (25%, and 30% from 2026) is reconciled by the individual via an annual tax return, not by simple payroll withholding. The exact year of application of the BYN 350,000 / 600,000 thresholds is a [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Escalate to a Belarusian tax professional."

**R-BY-SSC-2 -- Belgosstrakh risk-class tariff.** *Trigger:* a precise accident-insurance figure is requested for a specific industry. *Message:* "The Belgosstrakh premium is 0.6% as a base, but the actual rate depends on the assigned occupational risk class and coefficients (commonly cited ~0.2%–0.9%, up to ~1.5 for high-risk trades). Confirm against the specific tariff certificate. Do not quote a precise rate without it."

**R-BY-SSC-3 -- Self-employed / IP voluntary vs mandatory social portion.** *Trigger:* an individual entrepreneur asks whether the 6% social-insurance portion is mandatory. *Message:* "Whether the social-insurance portion is mandatory or voluntary for IPs, and the 29%+6% split, must be confirmed against current FSZN rules [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]. Escalate to a Belarusian payroll professional."

**R-BY-SSC-4 -- FSZN ceiling and HTP base figures.** *Trigger:* a computation depends on the 5×-average-wage ceiling or the HTP average-wage base. *Message:* "The FSZN ceiling (five times the national average monthly wage) and the HTP base (~BYN 2,000 in 2025) move with Belstat statistics. Verify the current Belstat average-wage figure before relying on the cap [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]."

**R-BY-SSC-5 -- Sanctions / payment practicalities.** *Trigger:* questions about how to actually remit funds cross-border. *Message:* "Belarus is under extensive international sanctions affecting banking and payment routing. This skill covers statutory rates only, not payment mechanics. Escalate banking questions to a sanctions-aware adviser."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for Belarusian bank statement transactions related to payroll, social contributions, and PIT. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the statement (Cyrillic or transliterated). FSZN, Belgosstrakh and PIT remittances are statutory obligations — EXCLUDE from any VAT return; treat per the notes for payroll-cost classification.

### 3.1 FSZN (Social Protection Fund) contributions

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ФСЗН, FSZN | EXCLUDE -- FSZN contribution | Pension (28%/29%) + social (6%) + employee (1%) |
| ФОНД СОЦИАЛЬНОЙ ЗАЩИТЫ, SOCIAL PROTECTION FUND | EXCLUDE -- FSZN contribution | Full authority name |
| ОТЧИСЛЕНИЯ В ФСЗН, STRAHOVYE VZNOSY | EXCLUDE -- FSZN contribution | "Insurance contributions" |
| ПЕНСИОННОЕ СТРАХОВАНИЕ, PENSION INSURANCE | EXCLUDE -- FSZN pension portion | 28% employer / 1% employee |
| СОЦИАЛЬНОЕ СТРАХОВАНИЕ | EXCLUDE -- FSZN social portion | 6% employer |

### 3.2 Belgosstrakh occupational-accident insurance

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| БЕЛГОССТРАХ, BELGOSSTRAKH | EXCLUDE -- accident insurance | Employer premium, ~0.6% base |
| СТРАХОВАНИЕ ОТ НЕСЧАСТНЫХ СЛУЧАЕВ | EXCLUDE -- accident insurance | "Insurance against accidents" |
| ОБЯЗАТ. СТРАХ. ОТ НС И ПЗ | EXCLUDE -- accident insurance | Industrial accidents / occupational diseases |

### 3.3 Personal income tax (PIT) — NOT FSZN; do not confuse

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ПОДОХОДНЫЙ НАЛОГ, PODOHODNYY NALOG | EXCLUDE -- PIT, not FSZN | 13% (25%/30% on high income) |
| МНС, MNS, INSPEKTSIYA PO NALOGAM | EXCLUDE -- tax authority remittance | Ministry of Taxes and Duties |
| НАЛОГ НА ДОХОДЫ ФИЗ. ЛИЦ | EXCLUDE -- PIT | Tax on income of individuals |

### 3.4 Salary and payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ЗАРПЛАТА, ЗАРАБОТНАЯ ПЛАТА, ZARPLATA (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- payroll expense | Net wage payment; not a contribution |
| АВАНС (outgoing) | EXCLUDE -- salary advance | Not a contribution |
| ЗАРПЛАТА, SALARY (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- employment income received | Not a contribution |

### 3.5 FSZN benefits received (not contributions paid)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ПЕНСИЯ, PENSIYA (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- pension income received | Not a contribution |
| ПОСОБИЕ, BENEFIT (incoming) | EXCLUDE -- temporary disability / maternity benefit | Reimbursed via FSZN; not a contribution paid |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement classifications and computations for a hypothetical Belarusian employer and self-employed individual. All amounts in BYN. Statement lines use a typical Belarusbank/Priorbank export format.

### Example 1 -- Employer FSZN remittance on standard payroll

**Scenario:** Employer pays an employee gross BYN 3,000/month (2025), not HTP resident.

**Input line:**
`20.02.2025 ; ФСЗН ОТЧИСЛЕНИЯ ЯНВАРЬ ; ДЕБЕТ ; -1,020.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "ФСЗН" (pattern 3.1). Employer FSZN = 34% × BYN 3,000 = BYN 1,020.00 (28% pension = BYN 840 + 6% social = BYN 180). This is the employer's January contribution, remitted by the 20th of February. Employee's 1% (BYN 30) is withheld separately from wages. EXCLUDE from VAT; record as a payroll on-cost.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- FSZN employer contribution (BYN 1,020.00 = 34% of BYN 3,000).

### Example 2 -- Employee 1% FSZN + 13% PIT withheld from wages

**Scenario:** Same BYN 3,000 gross. Employee deductions (2025).

**Reasoning:**
- Employee FSZN (1%) = BYN 3,000 × 1% = **BYN 30.00** (withheld).
- PIT base = gross less employee FSZN? In Belarus PIT is generally computed on gross income; for a conservative estimate ignoring personal deductions, PIT = BYN 3,000 × 13% = **BYN 390.00**.
- Net to employee = 3,000 − 30 − 390 = **BYN 2,580.00** (before any personal/child deductions, which reduce PIT).

**Classification:** Employee FSZN BYN 30.00 (EXCLUDE -- FSZN); PIT BYN 390.00 (EXCLUDE -- PIT). Net pay BYN 2,580.00. [Note: personal monthly deduction ~BYN 192 only applies where monthly income ≤ ~BYN 1,164, so it does NOT apply at BYN 3,000 — see Section 10.]

### Example 3 -- Belgosstrakh accident-insurance premium

**Scenario:** Same BYN 3,000 gross, base risk class.

**Input line:**
`20.02.2025 ; БЕЛГОССТРАХ СТРАХ ВЗНОС ; ДЕБЕТ ; -18.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "БЕЛГОССТРАХ" (pattern 3.2). Premium = 0.6% × BYN 3,000 = BYN 18.00. This is employer-only, on top of the 34% FSZN. Total employer on-cost = BYN 1,020.00 + BYN 18.00 = BYN 1,038.00 (= 34.6% × 3,000). EXCLUDE from VAT.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- Belgosstrakh accident insurance (BYN 18.00 = 0.6% of BYN 3,000). [Risk class assumed base — RESEARCH GAP if a higher coefficient applies.]

### Example 4 -- HTP resident: reduced FSZN base

**Scenario:** HTP resident employer, employee gross BYN 6,000/month (2025). HTP allows FSZN to be calculated on a base capped at the national average monthly wage (~BYN 2,000 in 2025) instead of full salary (eor.by / spex.by).

**Reasoning:**
- WITHOUT HTP: employer FSZN = 34% × 6,000 = BYN 2,040.00.
- WITH HTP base (~BYN 2,000): employer FSZN = 34% × 2,000 = **BYN 680.00**. Employee 1% = 2,000 × 1% = **BYN 20.00**.
- Saving on employer FSZN ≈ BYN 1,360/month. PIT is still computed on full gross: 13% × 6,000 = BYN 780.00 (assuming below the 25% annual threshold).

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- FSZN at HTP base (employer BYN 680.00). [HTP base ~BYN 2,000 is a Belstat-linked figure — RESEARCH GAP; verify current average wage.]

### Example 5 -- High earner crossing the 25% PIT threshold (2025)

**Scenario:** Executive with cumulative 2025 annual income of BYN 260,000.

**Reasoning:**
- 13% applies to the first BYN 220,000: 220,000 × 13% = **BYN 28,600.00**.
- 25% applies to income above BYN 220,000: (260,000 − 220,000) × 25% = 40,000 × 25% = **BYN 10,000.00**.
- Total PIT = 28,600 + 10,000 = **BYN 38,600.00**.
- The 25% portion is reconciled via the annual tax return (due 31 March); payroll only withholds 13% at source (eor.by / president.gov.by).

**Classification:** Payroll withholds 13% at source; the additional BYN 10,000 (25% band) is reconciled on the annual return. Flag for reviewer — annual reconciliation required (R-BY-SSC-1).

### Example 6 -- Self-employed / individual entrepreneur (IP) FSZN floor (2025)

**Scenario:** IP with low/irregular income; minimum-wage floor applies.

**Reasoning:**
- Annual FSZN floor = 12 × monthly minimum wage = 12 × BYN 726 = **BYN 8,712** base (search corroboration).
- FSZN = 35% × BYN 8,712 = **BYN 3,049.20/year** (29% pension = BYN 2,526.48 + 6% social = BYN 522.72).
- Contributions are due on actual income or this floor, whichever applies. The mandatory vs voluntary status of the 6% social portion is a [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm].

**Classification:** EXCLUDE -- IP FSZN (BYN 3,049.20/year minimum on the 12-minimum-wage floor). Flag for reviewer (R-BY-SSC-3).

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when bank statement data is clear and all required inputs are available. Apply exactly as written.

### Rule 1 -- Employer FSZN formula

```
Employer FSZN = gross_wages × 34%   (28% pension + 6% social)
```
Source: lloydsbanktrade / eor.by. Subject to the FSZN ceiling (Rule 7) and the HTP base option (Rule 8).

### Rule 2 -- Employee FSZN formula

```
Employee FSZN = gross_wages × 1%   (withheld and remitted by employer)
```
Source: lloydsbanktrade / globalization-partners. Combined employer + employee FSZN = 35%.

### Rule 3 -- Belgosstrakh accident insurance

```
Belgosstrakh = gross_payroll × 0.6%   (base; employer-only; risk-class adjusted)
```
Source: lloydsbanktrade / eor.by. Sits OUTSIDE the 35% FSZN total. Use 0.6% unless the specific industry risk class/coefficient is known (commonly ~0.2%–0.9%).

### Rule 4 -- PIT standard rate and withholding

PIT is a flat **13%** on most employment income, withheld at source by the employer at the time of salary payment (lloydsbanktrade / president.gov.by). Remitted on the day funds are received from the bank for wages.

### Rule 5 -- PIT increased rates (2025)

For tax year 2025, an increased rate of **25%** applies to annual income above **BYN 220,000** (eor.by / president.gov.by). The increased-rate portion is reconciled by the individual via the annual tax return — payroll withholds only 13% at source.

### Rule 6 -- PIT scale (2026)

For 2026, the Tax Code amendment signed December 2025 sets: **13%** up to BYN 350,000; **25%** on BYN 350,001–600,000; **30%** above BYN 600,000 (president.gov.by / Bloomberg Tax). Dividends remain on a separate 13%/25% scale. The exact year of application of the BYN 350,000 / 600,000 thresholds is a **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** — sources most consistently describe these as 2026 figures, with the 2025 25% threshold being BYN 220,000.

### Rule 7 -- FSZN ceiling (maximum base)

FSZN contributions are capped at a base of **five times the national average monthly wage** of the month preceding payment (search corroboration). The exact BYN ceiling moves with Belstat statistics — **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** the current average wage before applying the cap.

### Rule 8 -- HTP resident base option

High Technology Park (HTP) resident companies may calculate FSZN on a base capped at the national average monthly wage (**~BYN 2,000 in 2025**) rather than full salary, sharply reducing payroll on-costs (eor.by / spex.by). The ~BYN 2,000 figure is Belstat-linked — **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]**. PIT is still computed on full gross.

### Rule 9 -- Self-employed / IP FSZN

```
IP FSZN = max(actual_income, 12 × monthly_minimum_wage) × 35%   (29% pension + 6% social)
```
2025 floor = 12 × BYN 726 = BYN 8,712 (search corroboration). The 29%/6% split and whether the social portion is mandatory or voluntary are a **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]**.

### Rule 10 -- Payment timing

FSZN contributions are paid on the day wages are actually paid for the month, no later than the established wage-payment day — in practice no later than the **20th of the month following** the reporting month where wages are paid later (search corroboration). PIT is remitted at the time of salary payment.

### Rule 11 -- Reporting cadence

FSZN personalised reporting (Form **4-fund / 4-фонд**, plus **ПУ-3 / ПУ-6** personalised account data) is submitted **quarterly** (search corroboration). The annual individual tax return (for increased-rate reconciliation) is due by **31 March** of the following year, with tax payable by ~1 June (eor.by).

### Rule 12 -- These are personal/statutory obligations, not VAT supplies

FSZN, Belgosstrakh and PIT remittances are EXCLUDED from any VAT return. Employer FSZN and Belgosstrakh are deductible payroll on-costs for corporate income tax; employee FSZN (1%) and PIT are withheld from gross wages.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 -- HTP residency status unconfirmed

**Trigger:** Employer may be an HTP resident but residency is not documented.

**Issue:** HTP residency caps the FSZN base at the average monthly wage (~BYN 2,000), changing employer FSZN from 34% of full gross to a much smaller figure. Applying it wrongly under- or over-states contributions materially.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Do NOT apply the HTP base reduction without documented residency.

### T2-2 -- Annual income near the 25%/30% PIT thresholds

**Trigger:** Cumulative annual income approaches BYN 220,000 (2025) / BYN 350,000 or 600,000 (2026).

**Issue:** The increased-rate portion is reconciled via the annual return, not payroll withholding. The exact application year of the BYN 350,000 / 600,000 thresholds is unsettled in the sources.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer (R-BY-SSC-1). Confirm the threshold year against the Tax Code.

### T2-3 -- Belgosstrakh risk class unknown

**Trigger:** Industry/occupation has elevated accident risk but no tariff certificate is provided.

**Issue:** The 0.6% base can rise with risk-class coefficients (commonly to ~0.9%, up to ~1.5 for high-risk trades).

**Action:** Flag for reviewer (R-BY-SSC-2). Use 0.6% base as a placeholder and label it as such.

### T2-4 -- Self-employed / IP social-portion treatment

**Trigger:** An IP queries the 6% social-insurance portion.

**Issue:** Whether the 6% social portion is mandatory or voluntary for IPs, and the 29%+6% split, are not firmly sourced.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer (R-BY-SSC-3). Confirm against current FSZN rules.

### T2-5 -- FSZN ceiling application

**Trigger:** A high earner's gross exceeds five times the average monthly wage.

**Issue:** The ceiling caps the contributable base; the exact BYN figure moves with Belstat statistics.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer (R-BY-SSC-4). Verify the current average wage before capping.

### T2-6 -- Personal/child/disability PIT deductions

**Trigger:** Low-income employee or employee with children/dependants or privileged status.

**Issue:** The basic (~BYN 192), child (~BYN 56/107) and vulnerable-category (~BYN 272) monthly deductions are 2025 figures, indexed annually, and the basic deduction only applies where monthly income ≤ ~BYN 1,164.

**Action:** Flag for reviewer. Confirm 2025/2026 deduction amounts and eligibility against the Tax Code.

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How contribution/PIT debits appear on Belarusian bank statements

Belarusian statements are usually in Russian (Cyrillic); transliterated Latin variants appear in some exports. Common originating banks: Belarusbank (Беларусбанк), Belinvestbank, Priorbank, BPS-Sberbank, Alfa-Bank Belarus.

**FSZN contributions:**
- Description: "ФСЗН", "ФОНД СОЦИАЛЬНОЙ ЗАЩИТЫ", "ОТЧИСЛЕНИЯ В ФСЗН", "СТРАХОВЫЕ ВЗНОСЫ"
- Timing: by the 20th of the month following the reporting month (where wages paid later)
- Amount: 34% of the FSZN base for the employer portion; 1% withheld separately

**Belgosstrakh:**
- Description: "БЕЛГОССТРАХ", "СТРАХОВАНИЕ ОТ НЕСЧАСТНЫХ СЛУЧАЕВ"
- Amount: ~0.6% of payroll (risk-class adjusted)

**PIT:**
- Description: "ПОДОХОДНЫЙ НАЛОГ", "НАЛОГ НА ДОХОДЫ ФИЗ. ЛИЦ", "МНС"
- Timing: at salary payment
- Amount: 13% of PIT base (increased-rate portion reconciled annually)

**Key identification tips:**
1. Contribution/tax debits are always outgoing (ДЕБЕТ), never credits.
2. FSZN employer debits should be ~34% of the gross payroll base; if materially smaller, suspect an HTP base reduction (flag T2-1).
3. Belgosstrakh debits are small (~0.6%) and separate from FSZN.
4. Do not confuse outgoing "ФСЗН" debits with incoming "ПЕНСИЯ" / "ПОСОБИЕ" credits (benefits received).
5. PIT ("ПОДОХОДНЫЙ НАЛОГ" / "МНС") is a tax remittance, NOT a social contribution — keep them separate.

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for FSZN, Belgosstrakh and PIT debits** — identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns.
2. **Reverse-engineer the payroll base:**
   - Employer FSZN debit ÷ 0.34 ≈ gross payroll base (if NOT HTP).
   - If the implied base is suspiciously low relative to known salaries, suspect HTP base capping (~BYN 2,000) — flag T2-1.
   - Belgosstrakh debit ÷ 0.006 ≈ payroll base (cross-check).
   - PIT debit ÷ 0.13 ≈ PIT base (for income below the 25% threshold).
3. **Sum contributions by period** to confirm monthly/quarterly cadence.
4. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution and PIT figures derived from bank statement amounts only. HTP residency, Belgosstrakh risk class, annual income vs the 25%/30% PIT thresholds, and the 2026 threshold year have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing."

### Worked-figure cross-check (2025, BYN 3,000 gross, non-HTP)

| Line | Computation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Employer FSZN pension (28%) | 3,000 × 0.28 | 840.00 |
| Employer FSZN social (6%) | 3,000 × 0.06 | 180.00 |
| Employer FSZN total (34%) | 840 + 180 | 1,020.00 |
| Belgosstrakh (0.6%) | 3,000 × 0.006 | 18.00 |
| Employer total on-cost | 1,020 + 18 | 1,038.00 |
| Employee FSZN (1%) | 3,000 × 0.01 | 30.00 |
| PIT (13%, no deduction) | 3,000 × 0.13 | 390.00 |
| Net pay | 3,000 − 30 − 390 | 2,580.00 |

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Employee gross BYN 3,000, 2025, non-HTP. → Employer FSZN = 34% × 3,000 = **BYN 1,020.00** (840 + 180). Belgosstrakh = **BYN 18.00**. Employer total = **BYN 1,038.00**.

**Test 2:** Same employee, employee-side. → Employee FSZN = 1% × 3,000 = **BYN 30.00**; PIT = 13% × 3,000 = **BYN 390.00**; net pay = **BYN 2,580.00**.

**Test 3:** HTP employer, gross BYN 6,000, HTP base ~BYN 2,000. → Employer FSZN = 34% × 2,000 = **BYN 680.00**; employee FSZN = 1% × 2,000 = **BYN 20.00**; PIT still on full gross = 13% × 6,000 = **BYN 780.00**.

**Test 4:** Executive, 2025 annual income BYN 260,000. → PIT = (220,000 × 13%) + (40,000 × 25%) = 28,600 + 10,000 = **BYN 38,600.00**. 25% band reconciled on annual return.

**Test 5:** 2026 earner, annual income BYN 700,000. → PIT = (350,000 × 13%) + (250,000 × 25%) + (100,000 × 30%) = 45,500 + 62,500 + 30,000 = **BYN 138,000.00**. [2026 threshold year is a RESEARCH GAP — see Rule 6.]

**Test 6:** IP, low income, 2025 floor. → FSZN base = 12 × 726 = BYN 8,712; FSZN = 35% × 8,712 = **BYN 3,049.20** (pension 29% = 2,526.48 + social 6% = 522.72).

**Test 7:** Employer FSZN debit on statement = BYN 1,020.00, non-HTP. → Implied gross base = 1,020 ÷ 0.34 = **BYN 3,000** (reverse-engineering check, Section 9).

**Test 8:** Belgosstrakh debit = BYN 18.00. → Implied payroll base = 18 ÷ 0.006 = **BYN 3,000** (cross-check vs FSZN-derived base).

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply the HTP FSZN base reduction without documented HTP residency.
- NEVER quote a precise Belgosstrakh rate above the 0.6% base without the specific risk-class tariff certificate.
- NEVER withhold the 25%/30% PIT through payroll — the increased-rate portion is reconciled on the annual return.
- NEVER state the 2026 BYN 350,000 / 600,000 thresholds as settled without the reviewer confirming the application year (RESEARCH GAP).
- NEVER apply the FSZN ceiling or HTP base without verifying the current Belstat average wage (RESEARCH GAP).
- NEVER tell a self-employed/IP they owe FSZN below the 12-minimum-wage floor — the floor applies.
- NEVER conflate FSZN (social) with PIT (tax) with Belgosstrakh (accident insurance) — they are three separate obligations.
- NEVER confuse outgoing contribution debits with incoming pension/benefit credits.
- NEVER present any Belarus figure as definitive — confidence is MEDIUM and Big-4 coverage is absent; label estimates and direct to ssf.gov.by / nalog.gov.by.
- NEVER advise on sanctions-affected payment mechanics — statutory rates only.
