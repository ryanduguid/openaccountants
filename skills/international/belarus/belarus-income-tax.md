## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text) in BYN, plus confirmation of (a) tax residency (>183 days in Belarus in the calendar year), (b) status (employee / self-employed under Professional Income Tax / individual entrepreneur), and (c) whether any income was NOT taxed at source by a Belarusian tax agent.

**Recommended** — payroll slips (employer withholding records), FSZN contribution records, Professional Income Tax app receipts, marital/dependant status (for standard deductions), prior-year declaration.

**Ideal** — full income and expenditure records, evidence supporting standard and social/property deductions, foreign-source income statements, prior assessments.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without supporting records = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify residency, that all income taxed at source is correctly excluded from the self-declaration, and that any deductions claimed are supported."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-BY-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Belarus taxes residents (>183 days/year) on worldwide income and non-residents on Belarus-source income only. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming residency status. Please confirm before proceeding." (Source: revera.legal)

**R-BY-2 -- Companies and legal entities.** "This skill covers individuals, self-employed persons, and individual entrepreneurs only. Corporate profit tax (налог на прибыль) for legal entities is out of scope. Escalate to a Belarusian tax adviser."

**R-BY-3 -- High-income / 25%-30% bracket near threshold.** "Income approaching or exceeding BYN 220,000 (2025) engages the increased 25% rate, and the 30% top-rate trigger is not fully reconciled in this skill [RESEARCH GAP]. Escalate to a Belarusian tax adviser for high-income returns."

**R-BY-4 -- HTP / special regimes.** "High-Tech Park (HTP) residents historically benefited from a reduced 9% PIT; current treatment is unconfirmed [RESEARCH GAP]. Free Economic Zone, Great Stone, and other special regimes are out of scope. Escalate."

**R-BY-5 -- Arrears / enforcement / concealed income.** "Concealed or undeclared income is taxed at a penal 26% rate plus administrative/criminal liability. Do not advise on concealment or enforcement matters. Escalate to a Belarusian tax adviser immediately." (Source: GSL)

**R-BY-6 -- VAT or corporate filing requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Belarus VAT (НДС) or corporate profit tax, use the appropriate dedicated skill."

**R-BY-7 -- Cross-border / sanctions complexity.** "Belarus is under significant Western sanctions affecting cross-border payments, dividends, and banking. Domestic statutory rates are unchanged, but cross-border treatment requires specialist advice. Escalate."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Belarusian statements are typically in Russian; common terms are given in both. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All figures in BYN. Tax year 2025. PIT verified arithmetic shown inline.

### Example 1 -- Standard Salaried Employee (income above deduction threshold)

**Input line:**
`25/03/2025 ; БЕЛАРУСБАНК ЗАЧИСЛЕНИЕ ; РАБОТОДАТЕЛЬ ООО "АЛЬФА" ; ЗАРПЛАТА МАРТ ; +2,580.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
This is net salary already credited. Reconstruct from a gross of BYN 3,000/month. Monthly income BYN 3,000 exceeds BYN 1,164, so NO standard personal deduction applies. PIT = 3,000 × 13% = BYN 390.00. Employee FSZN = 3,000 × 1% = BYN 30.00. Net = 3,000 − 390 − 30 = **BYN 2,580.00**. Employer separately pays FSZN 34% (BYN 1,020) + Belgosstrakh ~0.6% (BYN 18). (Source: president.gov.by; ssf.gov.by; G-P)

**Classification:** Employment income, PIT withheld at source. Excluded from any self-declaration.

### Example 2 -- Low-Income Employee with Standard Deduction and One Child

**Input line:**
`25/04/2025 ; БЕЛИНВЕСТБАНК ; РАБОТОДАТЕЛЬ ; ЗАРПЛАТА ; +978.24 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross monthly salary BYN 1,100. Because 1,100 ≤ BYN 1,164, the BYN 192 personal deduction applies; plus BYN 56 for one child under 18. Taxable base = 1,100 − 192 − 56 = BYN 852.00. PIT = 852 × 13% = BYN 110.76. Employee FSZN = 1,100 × 1% = BYN 11.00. Net = 1,100 − 110.76 − 11.00 = **BYN 978.24**. (Source: eor.by; by.icalculator.com)

**Classification:** Employment income with standard + child deduction applied.

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed under Professional Income Tax (PIT app)

**Input line:**
`12/06/2025 ; ПРИОРБАНК ; ООО "КЛИЕНТ" ; ОПЛАТА УСЛУГ ; +5,000.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Freelancer registered under the Professional Income Tax regime, total annual income BYN 80,000 received from Belarusian organisations. First BYN 60,000 at 10% = BYN 6,000. Excess BYN 20,000 at 20% = BYN 4,000. Annual Professional Income Tax = **BYN 10,000**. Tax is assessed and paid monthly via the official app; no separate annual return is required; receipts are generated per payment. (Source: help.solarstaff.com; spex.by)

**Classification:** Self-employment income, Professional Income Tax regime.

### Example 4 -- High-Income Individual Crossing the 25% Threshold (2025)

**Input (annual aggregate):**
Total 2025 income BYN 250,000.

**Reasoning:**
For 2025, income up to BYN 220,000 is taxed at 13%, and the portion above BYN 220,000 at 25%. First 220,000 × 13% = BYN 28,600. Excess 30,000 × 25% = BYN 7,500. Total PIT = **BYN 36,100**. (Source: president.gov.by; eor.by) Note: if this were 2026, the 25% threshold would be BYN 350,000 and the whole BYN 250,000 would be at 13% = BYN 32,500 — **do not conflate years.**

**Classification:** High-income individual; 25% increased rate engaged for 2025. Flag for reviewer (R-BY-3).

### Example 5 -- Individual Entrepreneur (general 20% regime)

**Input (annual):**
IE gross receipts BYN 90,000; documented deductible business expenses BYN 30,000.

**Reasoning:**
IE on the general regime taxes net income. Net = 90,000 − 30,000 = BYN 60,000. PIT = 60,000 × 20% = **BYN 12,000**. The 30% rate would apply only on income above ~BYN 500,000 [RESEARCH GAP — threshold]. (Source: arzinger.by; GSL) Note: a 16% figure also appears in some sources for IEs [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm applicable 2025 rate].

**Classification:** Individual entrepreneur, general regime. Flag for reviewer.

### Example 6 -- Own-Account Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; АЛЬФА-БАНК ; ВНУТРЕННИЙ ПЕРЕВОД — НАКОПИТЕЛЬНЫЙ ; ; -2,000.00 ; BYN`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between the taxpayer's own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Flat 13% Standard Rate

**Legislation:** Tax Code, Special Part, Chapter 18; Article 214.

Belarus levies a flat 13% personal income tax (podokhodny nalog) on most income of residents; this rate covers ~98% of employed persons. (Source: president.gov.by tax-system page)

### 5.2 Increased Rates (25% and 30%)

| Year | 25% applies to portion above | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 | BYN 200,000 | president.gov.by |
| 2025 | BYN 220,000 | president.gov.by; eor.by |
| 2026 | BYN 350,000 (broadened base) | president.gov.by event 1767167458 |

The 25% rate is applied only to the portion of total annual income above the threshold, not to the whole. A 30% top rate exists for the highest incomes; Article 214 §3 cites BYN 500,000 (some summaries say BYN 600,000) [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact 2025 PIT trigger and scope].

### 5.3 Tax Residency

**Legislation:** Tax Code, Special Part.

Tax residency is based on physical presence of more than 183 days in a calendar year (1 Jan – 31 Dec). Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Belarus-source income only. (Source: revera.legal; taxatlas.io)

### 5.4 Social Contributions (FSZN) and Accident Insurance

**Authority:** Social Protection Fund (FSZN — ssf.gov.by); accident insurance via Belgosstrakh. Governed by Decree No. 40 (24.09.2024) and FSZN legislation.

| Contribution | Payer | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FSZN — pension (employer) | employer | 28% | gross salary | ssf.gov.by; G-P |
| FSZN — social insurance (employer) | employer | 6% | gross salary | ssf.gov.by; G-P |
| **FSZN total (employer)** | **employer** | **34%** | **gross salary** | **ssf.gov.by; G-P** |
| FSZN — pension (employee) | employee | 1% | gross salary | payslip.com; recruitment.by |
| Accident insurance (Belgosstrakh) | employer | ~0.6% standard (range ~0.1%–0.9% by occupational risk class) [RESEARCH GAP — range varies by source] | gross salary | G-P; eor.by |

Employer total = 28% + 6% = **34%** ✓. Combined employer on-cost ≈ 34% + 0.6% = **34.6%** of gross.

| Self-employed / IE FSZN | Payer | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension (mandatory) | self | 29% | self-determined base, not below minimum wage, not above 5× average wage | ssf.gov.by [RESEARCH GAP — confirm split/base] |
| Social insurance (sickness) | self | 6% | same base | ssf.gov.by [RESEARCH GAP] |
| **Self-employed total** | **self** | **35%** | **chosen base** | **ssf.gov.by** |

Self-employed total = 29% + 6% = **35%** ✓. The social (sickness) portion is voluntary for some categories; the pension portion is mandatory. Minimum annual contribution is tied to the minimum wage [RESEARCH GAP — confirm 2025 mechanics from ssf.gov.by].

### 5.5 Employee Withholding (Tax Agent Mechanics)

Employers act as tax agents, withholding 13% PIT (plus the increased rate where annual income crosses the threshold) and the 1% employee FSZN from each salary payment, and remitting both to the authorities. Total employee deduction ≈ 13% + 1% = **14%** of gross (before standard deductions). (Source: payslip.com; recruitment.by)

### 5.6 Standard Monthly Deductions (2025)

| Deduction | Amount (BYN/month) | Condition | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard personal deduction | 192 | Only if monthly taxable income ≤ BYN 1,164 | eor.by; by.icalculator.com |
| Per child under 18 / per dependent | 56 | Each | eor.by |
| Enhanced per-child deduction | 107 | Parents with 2+ children, single parents, widows/widowers, guardians/foster parents, parents of disabled children | eor.by |
| Special-category deduction | 272 | Disability groups I–II, Chernobyl-affected persons, certain veterans | eor.by; by.icalculator.com |

### 5.7 Dividends to Resident Individuals

| Scenario | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard resident dividend | 13% | spex.by; vmp.by |
| Reduced (profits not distributed 3 years) | 6% | Valid through 31 Dec 2025; abolished from 1 Jan 2026 [RESEARCH GAP — exact 3- vs 5-year retention conditions differ between sources] (spex.by) |
| Historic 0% (not distributed 5 years) | 0% | Historic (spex.by) |
| Dividends to non-residents | 25% (raised from 15%) | Effective 2025 (vmp.by) |

### 5.8 Professional Income Tax Regime (Self-Employed)

**Authority:** MNS official Professional Income Tax mobile app.

| Band | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Income up to BYN 60,000 (from Belarusian orgs/IEs and individuals) | 10% | help.solarstaff.com; spex.by |
| Excess above BYN 60,000 | 20% | help.solarstaff.com |
| Pensioners | 8% | help.solarstaff.com |

Receipts are generated in the official app on each payment received; tax is assessed and paid monthly via the app; **no separate annual return is required.** (Source: help.solarstaff.com)

### 5.9 Individual Entrepreneur (General Regime)

Registered IEs on the general regime pay PIT at 20% on net income, with 30% applying above ~BYN 500,000 annual income (Art. 214 §3). The simplified single-tax / USN regimes were largely phased out for IEs across 2023–2025. (Source: arzinger.by; allfordmorisson.by; GSL) A 16% figure also appears in some sources for IEs / unexplained income [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the applicable 2025 rate].

### 5.10 Filing Deadlines and Penalties

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Annual self-declaration | Income NOT taxed at source (foreign-source, non-tax-agent income, certain property/share sales) | revera.legal |
| Declaration deadline | 31 March of the following year | revera.legal; eor.by |
| Payment of declared tax | 1 June of the following year (one calculator cites 15 May) [RESEARCH GAP — verify] | revera.legal |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 The 30% Top-Rate Threshold

The exact BYN threshold for the 30% top rate in the PIT context for 2025 is unresolved — Article 214 §3 cites BYN 500,000 but some summaries say BYN 600,000, and it is unclear whether 30% applies to all individuals or mainly IEs on general taxation. **Conservative default:** flag for reviewer; do not auto-apply 30% [RESEARCH GAP].

### 6.2 Individual Entrepreneur Deductible Expenses

IE net-income computation requires applying the wholly-and-exclusively (business-purpose) test to each expense. Personal, entertainment, and capital items require judgement. **Conservative default:** not deductible until reviewer confirms business purpose and documentation.

### 6.3 Self-Employed / IE FSZN Base

The self-determined contribution base (not below minimum wage, not above 5× average wage), the mandatory-pension vs voluntary-social split, and the 29%/6% structure need confirmation from ssf.gov.by. **Flag for reviewer** [RESEARCH GAP].

### 6.4 Foreign-Source Income and Double Taxation

Residents are taxed on worldwide income. Foreign-source income must be self-declared. Treaty relief / foreign tax credits and sanctions-affected flows require specialist analysis. **Flag for reviewer.**

### 6.5 HTP (High-Tech Park) Residents

HTP employees historically benefited from a reduced 9% PIT; reporting indicates the generally-established 13% rate applied in some 2025 cases. **Conservative default:** apply 13% and flag for reviewer to confirm current HTP treatment [RESEARCH GAP].

### 6.6 Dividend Reduced-Rate Conditions

The 6% reduced dividend rate's exact retention conditions (3 vs 5 years) differ between sources, and it is abolished from 1 Jan 2026. **Flag for reviewer** [RESEARCH GAP].

### 6.7 Property / Share Disposals

Capital gains on property and share disposals have specific rules (and from 2026 share-sale gains enter the higher-rate base). **Flag for reviewer.**

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Standard salaried employee, above deduction threshold.**
Input: Gross BYN 3,000/month; monthly income > BYN 1,164 (no personal deduction).
Expected: PIT = 3,000 × 13% = BYN 390.00. Employee FSZN = 3,000 × 1% = BYN 30.00. Net = BYN 2,580.00. Employer FSZN = BYN 1,020.00; Belgosstrakh ≈ BYN 18.00.

**Test 2 -- Low-income employee with deductions.**
Input: Gross BYN 1,100/month (≤ 1,164); one child.
Expected: Base = 1,100 − 192 − 56 = BYN 852.00. PIT = 852 × 13% = BYN 110.76. FSZN = BYN 11.00. Net = BYN 978.24.

**Test 3 -- 25% increased rate (2025).**
Input: Annual income BYN 250,000.
Expected: 220,000 × 13% = BYN 28,600 + 30,000 × 25% = BYN 7,500 = total PIT BYN 36,100.

**Test 4 -- Year-conflation guard (2026).**
Input: Same BYN 250,000 but tax year 2026.
Expected: Below BYN 350,000 threshold → entirely at 13% = BYN 32,500. (Confirms 2025 vs 2026 thresholds must not be conflated.)

**Test 5 -- Professional Income Tax bands.**
Input: BYN 80,000 from Belarusian organisations (non-pensioner).
Expected: 60,000 × 10% = BYN 6,000 + 20,000 × 20% = BYN 4,000 = total BYN 10,000.

**Test 6 -- Individual Entrepreneur general regime.**
Input: Gross BYN 90,000; deductible expenses BYN 30,000.
Expected: Net = BYN 60,000; PIT = 60,000 × 20% = BYN 12,000. (30% only above ~BYN 500,000 [RESEARCH GAP].)

**Test 7 -- Employer on-cost reconciliation.**
Input: Gross BYN 3,000.
Expected: FSZN 34% (28% + 6%) = BYN 1,020.00; Belgosstrakh ~0.6% = BYN 18.00; total employer on-cost ≈ BYN 1,038.00 (34.6%).
