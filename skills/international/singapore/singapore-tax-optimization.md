### Individual Tax Brackets (YA 2026, Residents)

| Chargeable Income (SGD) | Rate | Gross Tax Payable |
|---|---|---|
| First 20,000 | 0% | $0 |
| 20,001 – 30,000 | 2% | $200 |
| 30,001 – 40,000 | 3.5% | $550 |
| 40,001 – 80,000 | 7% | $3,350 |
| 80,001 – 120,000 | 11.5% | $7,950 |
| 120,001 – 160,000 | 15% | $13,950 |
| 160,001 – 200,000 | 18% | $21,150 |
| 200,001 – 240,000 | 19% | $28,750 |
| 240,001 – 280,000 | 19.5% | $36,550 |
| 280,001 – 320,000 | 20% | $44,550 |
| 320,001 – 500,000 | 22% | $84,150 |
| 500,001 – 1,000,000 | 23% | $199,150 |
| Above 1,000,000 | 24% | — |

**YA 2026 Personal Income Tax Rebate:** 60% of tax payable, capped at $200 (automatically applied).

**No capital gains tax.** No estate/inheritance tax. No dividend tax. Territorial system — only Singapore-sourced income and foreign income remitted to Singapore are taxable (with substantial exemptions for individuals).

---

## Section 2 — Income Splitting & Structuring

### Sole Proprietor vs Company (Pte Ltd)

**Sole proprietor:** business income reported in personal tax return at progressive rates (0%–24%). Simple compliance. Losses offset personal income.

**Private Limited Company (Pte Ltd):** profits taxed at flat 17%. Effective rate much lower due to exemption schemes:

| Scheme | First $100k | Next $100k |
|---|---|---|
| Start-Up Tax Exemption (SUTE) — first 3 YAs | 75% exempt | 50% exempt |
| Partial Tax Exemption (PTE) — all companies | 75% exempt | 50% exempt (first $100k at 75% exempt, next $100k at 50%) |

SUTE effective rate on first $200,000 profit: ~6.4% (before CIT rebate).

**CIT Rebate YA 2026:** 50% of corporate tax payable, capped at $40,000 (less $2,000 CIT Rebate Cash Grant if applicable). Applied automatically.

**When to incorporate:** generally beneficial when annual profit exceeds ~$80,000–$100,000. Company retains earnings at low effective rates. Extraction via salary (deductible to company) or dividends (tax-free to Singapore tax-resident shareholders — one-tier system).

### Dividends — One-Tier System

Singapore operates a one-tier corporate tax system: dividends paid from corporate profits that have been taxed at the corporate level are tax-exempt in the hands of shareholders. No further tax, no franking system needed.

### Family Structuring

Singapore has no formal income-splitting or family trust regime comparable to Australia or Canada. Key strategies:
- Employ family members in the company at arm's-length salaries — deductible to the company
- Utilise spousal and dependent reliefs (limited, see Section 3)
- Make CPF top-ups for family members (generates reliefs — see Section 8)
- No attribution rules for investment income gifted to family (unlike some jurisdictions)

---

## Section 3 — Deductions Most People Miss

### Personal Reliefs (Subject to $80,000 Cap)

| Relief | Amount | Key Conditions |
|---|---|---|
| Earned income relief | $1,000 (below 55); $6,000 (55–59); $8,000 (60+) | Automatic for those with earned income |
| Spouse relief | $2,000 | Spouse income ≤$4,000/year; living together or maintained |
| Qualifying child relief (QCR) | $4,000/child | Child under 16, or full-time student/NS, income ≤$4,000 |
| Handicapped child relief | $7,500/child | In lieu of QCR if child is handicapped |
| Working mother's child relief (WMCR) | 15%/20%/25% of mother's earned income (1st/2nd/3rd+ child) | Mother must be married, divorced, or widowed. Combines with QCR up to $50,000/child |
| Parent relief | $9,000 (living together); $5,500 (not living together) | Parent 55+, income ≤$4,000, living in Singapore |
| Handicapped parent relief | $14,000 / $10,000 | In lieu of parent relief |
| Grandparent caregiver relief | $3,000 | Working mother; grandparent/parent cares for child |
| Life insurance relief | Lower of premiums paid or $5,000 | Only if CPF contributions <$5,000 |
| Course fees relief | $5,500 | Courses for degree, diploma, professional qualification |
| CPF relief | Mandatory CPF contributions | Auto-included. Self-employed: MediSave contributions |
| CPF cash top-up relief | Up to $8,000 (self) + $8,000 (family member) | Top-up to Special/Retirement/MediSave account |
| SRS relief | Up to $15,300 (citizen/PR) or $35,700 (foreigner) | Contributions by 31 December |
| NSman relief | $1,500–$5,000 | Active/non-active NSman and spouse/parent |

### Self-Employed Deductions (Trade, Business, Profession)

| Deduction | Provision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Wholly and exclusively rule | s 14 ITA | All expenses must be incurred to produce income |
| Home office expenses | s 14 | Proportional deduction (dedicated workspace). IRAS requires reasonable basis |
| Renovation and refurbishment | s 14Q ITA | Capped at $300,000 over 3 consecutive YAs. Spread 1/3 per year |
| Approved donations | s 37 ITA | 250% tax deduction on qualifying donations to IPCs (extended through 2026) |
| R&D expenditure | s 14C, 14E ITA | Enhanced deductions for qualifying R&D |
| Medical expenses (employees) | s 14 | Capped at 1% of total remuneration (2% if implementing PHPC programme) |
| Training expenses | s 14 | Staff training — fully deductible |

---

## Section 4 — Capital Allowances Optimization

### Section 19/19A — Capital Allowances (Depreciation for Tax)

| Method | Detail |
|---|---|
| Section 19 — over working life | Claim over prescribed or estimated working life of the asset |
| Section 19A — 1-year write-off | Immediate 100% write-off of qualifying plant and machinery in the year of purchase. Powerful accelerated deduction |
| Section 19A — 3-year write-off | Spread equally over 3 years. Useful if company is in loss and wants to utilise CAs when profitable |

**Section 19A(1) one-year write-off** is the default accelerated option for most equipment, computers, furniture, and tools. No cost cap per asset.

### Low-Value Assets

Assets costing ≤$5,000 each (aggregate ≤$30,000/YA): immediate write-off even if not qualifying for s 19A.

### Motor Vehicles

Private motor vehicles: capital allowances NOT available (s 15 ITA). Commercial vehicles (goods vehicles, buses): capital allowances claimable over estimated useful life.

### Intellectual Property

Writing-down allowances on qualifying IP (patents, copyrights, trademarks, designs) under s 19B ITA. 5-year or 10-year write-off from date of registration/acquisition.

---

## Section 5 — Loss Utilization

### Current Year Losses

Business losses can be set off against all other income in the same YA (s 37 ITA). Self-employed losses offset employment and investment income.

### Carry Forward

Unabsorbed losses and capital allowances carry forward indefinitely (s 37(3)), subject to:
- **Shareholding test:** substantial shareholders (≥50%) must remain the same. If ownership changes, losses may be forfeited unless IRAS grants waiver
- Losses and CAs must be deducted in the order they arise (FIFO)

### Carry Back (Group Relief)

- **Carry-back:** unabsorbed CAs, trade losses, and donations can be carried back 1 YA (up to $100,000) under s 37E — claim must be made within the filing deadline
- **Group relief (s 37C):** current-year unabsorbed losses, CAs, and donations can be transferred to related Singapore companies (75%+ common ownership)

### Loss Planning

- Use s 19A 1-year write-off to accelerate CAs in profitable years; use 3-year write-off to spread when expecting future profits
- Carry back $100,000 of losses to prior profitable YA for immediate refund
- Group relief to utilise losses across related companies

---

## Section 6 — Timing Strategies

| Strategy | Detail |
|---|---|
| SRS contribution by 31 December | Contributions made by 31 Dec qualify for relief in the following YA. Maximum: $15,300 (citizen/PR) |
| CPF cash top-up by 31 December | Top-up to own or family member's CPF Special/Retirement/MediSave account for up to $16,000 relief |
| Asset purchases before year-end | Use s 19A one-year write-off on equipment purchased before 31 December |
| Defer income (self-employed) | Delay invoicing past 31 December to defer income to next YA |
| Accelerate expenses | Pay deductible expenses before 31 December |
| Donations to IPCs | 250% deduction on qualifying donations. Consolidate donations before year-end |
| Carry-back of losses | Elect carry-back within filing deadline. Useful if current year is loss-making but prior year was profitable |
| Renovation costs | Plan major renovations to maximise the $300,000 s 14Q cap across 3 consecutive YAs |
| Personal income tax rebate | Automatically applied — no action needed. But ensures every dollar of tax saved is further reduced by rebate |

---

## Section 7 — GST Optimization

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| Registration threshold | Mandatory if taxable turnover >$1 million (retrospective 12 months or prospective 12 months). Voluntary registration below threshold to claim input tax |
| Voluntary registration trade-off | Allows input GST credits but must charge 9% GST to customers. Advantageous if customers are GST-registered businesses (they claim it back). Disadvantageous for B2C businesses (price-sensitive consumers) |
| Input tax claims | GST on business expenses. Not claimable on: motor vehicle expenses (private), club memberships, medical expenses (with exceptions), transaction costs for share/property transfers |
| Exempt supplies | Financial services, sale/lease of residential property, import/local supply of investment precious metals. No GST charged, limited input credit |
| Zero-rated exports | International services and exported goods at 0% GST. Full input credit claimable. Excellent for export-oriented businesses |
| Tourist refund scheme | Tourists can claim GST refund on qualifying purchases >$100 via eTRS |
| Reverse charge | From 1 Jan 2020: GST-registered businesses must self-account for GST on imported services (B2B). Prevents advantage of importing services from overseas |
| Simplified Filing | Major Exporter Scheme, Approved 3rd Party Logistics, Import GST Deferment Scheme — various cash-flow benefits for qualifying businesses |

---

## Section 8 — CPF & Social Security Optimization

### CPF (Central Provident Fund) — Employees and Self-Employed

**Employees:** mandatory CPF contributions by employer and employee.

| Age | Employee Rate | Employer Rate | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| ≤55 | 20% | 17% | 37% |
| 55–60 | 15% | 14.5% | 29.5% |
| 60–65 | 9.5% | 11% | 20.5% |
| 65–70 | 7% | 8.5% | 15.5% |
| 70+ | 5% | 7.5% | 12.5% |

Ordinary Wage ceiling: $7,400/month (from 1 Jan 2026). Additional Wage ceiling ensures total annual CPF does not exceed $44,400 (employee share, based on OW + AW caps).

**Self-employed:** mandatory MediSave contributions only (based on net trade income). No mandatory OA/SA contributions — but voluntary contributions possible.

### CPF Cash Top-Up Relief

Top up your own or family member's Special Account, Retirement Account, or MediSave Account:
- **Self:** up to $8,000 relief
- **Family member:** additional up to $8,000 relief
- **Total possible:** $16,000/year

This directly reduces taxable income while boosting retirement savings. Often overlooked by higher earners.

### SRS (Supplementary Retirement Scheme)

- **Contribution cap:** $15,300/year (citizen/PR); $35,700 (foreigner)
- **Contribution deadline:** 31 December
- **Tax relief:** full deduction (within $80,000 overall relief cap)
- **Investment flexibility:** invest SRS funds in shares, bonds, unit trusts, REITs, ETFs, FDs
- **Withdrawal at retirement (statutory age):** only 50% of withdrawals are taxable. Spread withdrawals over 10 years for maximum tax efficiency
- **Penalty withdrawal (before statutory retirement age):** 100% taxable + 5% penalty

### Optimization Strategy

For higher earners:
1. **CPF Cash Top-Up** — $16,000 relief (instant tax saving)
2. **SRS Contribution** — $15,300 relief (invest for retirement, 50% taxable on withdrawal)
3. Combined: $31,300 annual relief from retirement channels alone

At 22% marginal rate: **~$6,886 annual tax saving.**

## Section 9 — Investment & Retirement

| Investment | Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| Capital gains | Not taxable (unless IRAS treats as trading income — based on badges of trade) |
| Dividends (Singapore companies) | Tax-exempt under one-tier system |
| Dividends (foreign, not remitted) | Generally not taxable for individuals (territorial basis) |
| Interest income | Taxable if Singapore-sourced. Bank interest from approved banks in Singapore: exempt for individuals |
| Rental income | Taxable at marginal rates. Deduct property tax, maintenance, interest, insurance, agent fees |
| REITs | Distributions are tax-exempt for individuals (if REIT satisfies qualifying conditions) |
| SRS withdrawals | 50% taxable at retirement; 100% if early withdrawal + 5% penalty |
| CPF withdrawals | Tax-free (contributions from post-tax income) |

### Tax-Free Investment Income

Singapore residents benefit from:
- No capital gains tax on shares, property, crypto (if not trading)
- Tax-exempt Singapore company dividends
- Tax-exempt interest from approved banks
- Tax-exempt REIT distributions
- No estate/inheritance tax

**Key risk:** if IRAS reclassifies asset disposals as "trading income" (based on frequency, holding period, profit-seeking motive), gains become taxable at marginal rates. Maintain clear long-term investment intent and documentation.

---

## Section 10 — Red Lines (GAAR & Scrutiny Triggers)

### Section 33 ITA (General Anti-Avoidance)

IRAS can disregard or vary any arrangement that has the purpose or effect of (directly or indirectly) reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability if the arrangement is not carried out for bona fide commercial reasons and has as one of its main purposes the avoidance of tax.

### IRAS Scrutiny Triggers

| Trigger | Risk |
|---|---|
| Personal expenses claimed as business deductions | Disallowed; penalties. s 14 wholly-and-exclusively test |
| Private motor vehicle expenses claimed | Specifically disallowed under s 15 ITA |
| Excessive reliefs claimed (>$80,000) | Automatically capped; but fraudulent claims trigger penalties |
| Artificial splitting of business income | IRAS may aggregate under s 33 |
| Non-arm's length transactions with related parties | Transfer pricing adjustments (s 34D, 34E ITA) |
| Trading income disguised as capital gains | Reclassification — assessed at income tax rates |
| SRS over-contribution | No additional relief; funds cannot be withdrawn without penalty |
| Non-resident claiming resident rates | 183-day rule strictly applied. Non-residents taxed at 15% or resident rates (higher of) |
| Failure to register for GST above $1m threshold | Penalties: up to $10,000 fine + 10% of GST unpaid |
| Employment income channelled through company to avoid personal tax | s 33 application; shareholder benefit assessment |

### Absolute Prohibitions

- NEVER advise claiming private motor vehicle expenses as business deductions
- NEVER advise misrepresenting trade income as capital gains
- NEVER advise non-residents to claim resident tax rates without meeting the 183-day rule
- NEVER advise exceeding the $80,000 personal relief cap (system enforces this, but do not structure around it artificially)
- NEVER advise failing to register for GST when turnover exceeds $1 million
- NEVER advise arrangements with the sole purpose of tax avoidance

---

## Section 11 — Annual Tax Planning Calendar

| When | Action |
|---|---|
| January | New YA begins (on prior-year income). Review SRS contribution (if not maxed by 31 Dec). Finalise IR8A preparation (employers) |
| February | Receive IR8A from employer. Gather donation receipts, CPF statements, rental income records |
| March | Prepare tax return. Verify pre-filled reliefs on myTax Portal. File early for faster processing |
| April 15/18 | Filing deadline (paper/e-file). Ensure all reliefs claimed and verified |
| May–June | Receive Notice of Assessment. Object within 30 days if incorrect. Pay tax by due date (usually ~1 month after NOA) |
| July | Mid-year review. Estimate annual income for SRS/CPF planning. Review GST registration threshold |
| September | GIRO instalment payments (if applicable). Review YA position for carry-back elections |
| October | Corporate tax: estimated chargeable income (ECI) due within 3 months of financial year-end |
| November | Plan year-end SRS contribution and CPF top-ups. Evaluate asset purchases for s 19A write-off |
| December 31 | **Critical date.** SRS contribution deadline. CPF cash top-up deadline. Make qualifying donations (250% deduction). Final asset purchases for capital allowances. Review self-employed MediSave contributions |

---

## Section 12 — Cash Impact Examples

### Example 1 — Sole Proprietor vs Pte Ltd

**Net business profit: $200,000.**

**Sole proprietor:** personal tax on $200,000 = ~$21,150. No further extraction tax.

**Pte Ltd (SUTE, Year 1):** First $100k × 75% exempt → $25,000 taxable at 17% = $4,250. Next $100k × 50% exempt → $50,000 taxable at 17% = $8,500. Total corporate tax: $12,750. CIT Rebate (50%, capped $40,000): save $6,375. Net corporate tax: $6,375. Pay $100,000 salary (deductible) → personal tax ~$3,350. Remaining $93,625 as dividend (tax-free). **Total tax: ~$9,725. Saving: ~$11,425.**

### Example 2 — SRS + CPF Top-Up (Employee, $180,000 Income)

Without optimization: chargeable income $180,000 – earned income relief $1,000 = $179,000. Tax: ~$22,600.

With optimization:
- SRS contribution: $15,300
- CPF cash top-up (self + parent): $16,000
- Total additional reliefs: $31,300
- Chargeable income: $147,700. Tax: ~$16,580.
- **Annual saving: ~$6,020** (plus retirement savings growth and 50% SRS tax on withdrawal)

### Example 3 — 250% Donation Deduction

Donate $10,000 to an IPC. Tax deduction: $25,000 (250%). At 22% marginal rate: **$5,500 tax saving on a $10,000 donation.** Effective cost of donation: $4,500.

### Example 4 — Section 19A One-Year Write-Off

Company purchases $150,000 of equipment. Section 19A: full deduction in Year 1. At 17% corporate rate: **$25,500 tax saving** in the year of purchase (vs spreading over useful life). With CIT rebate (50%): effective saving amplified.
