## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Section 1 -- Quick Reference**

**Section 1 -- Quick Reference**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Republic of Cyprus |
| Currency | EUR |
| Headline levers | Non-dom (0% SDC on dividends/interest/rents); company + dividend extraction; IP Box (~3% on qualifying IP) |
| Personal income tax | 0% up to €19,500 (2025); 20/25/30/35% bands above. **2026 reform raises the 0% band to €22,000** — confirm against `cyprus-income-tax.md`. |
| Corporate tax | 12.5% → **15%** under OECD Pillar Two (confirm effective date) |
| SDC (Special Defence Contribution) | Applies to dividends/interest/rents of Cyprus-DOMICILED residents; **non-doms are exempt** |
| Self-employed social insurance | ~16.6% of deemed income |
| Anti-avoidance | Substance / place-of-effective-management; ATAD GAAR |

> **The Cyprus headline is the NON-DOM + COMPANY combo:** run profits through a Cyprus company (15% CIT from 1 January 2026; 12.5% up to 31 December 2025), then extract as dividends which — for a non-dom — bear **0% SDC and 0% PIT**. Total effective tax ≈ the corporate rate only.

## Section 2 -- Non-Dom Regime (the headline)

- **Non-dom 0% SDC on worldwide dividends, interest and rental income** — A Cyprus tax resident who is non-domiciled pays 0% SDC on worldwide dividends, interest and rental income for 17 years of residency (extendable by two further 5-year blocks via a €250,000 lump-sum fee each → up to 27 years).  _(Savva; KPMG)_
- **Becoming resident — routes** — 183-day rule, or 60-day rule: ≥60 days in Cyprus, no >183 days in any single country, plus a Cyprus tie (business/employment/directorship) and a residence (owned or rented). From 1 January 2026, the condition of not being tax-resident elsewhere is removed; other conditions must still be met.

**AUDIT FLASH POINT** — the 60-day route and non-dom status require genuine residency and ties; sham residency is challengeable. Confirm the client actually meets the day-count and tie tests.

## Section 3 -- Company + Dividend Extraction

**Section 3 -- Company + Dividend Extraction**

| Step | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Trade through a Cyprus company | 12.5–15% CIT on profits |
| Pay a modest director salary | Deductible; subject to PIT + social insurance; covers cover/pension |
| Distribute the rest as dividends | Non-dom shareholder: **0% SDC + 0% PIT** on dividends (GHS at 2.65% may apply, subject to the EUR 180,000 annual GHS cap) |

Net effect for a non-dom owner-manager: roughly the **corporate rate only** on extracted profit. Compare with operating as a **self-employed individual**, taxed on the progressive scale up to 35% — usually worse at higher incomes. **[RESEARCH GAP — model the salary/dividend split and confirm the GHS (health) contribution treatment on dividends.]**

## Section 4 -- IP Box (~3% on qualifying IP)

- **IP Box mechanics** — Qualifying IP income (patents, copyrighted software, etc.) gets an 80% deemed deduction, so only 20% is taxed at the corporate rate → ≈3% effective. Benefit is proportional to the R&D you actually incur (OECD modified nexus). Ideal for SaaS/tech/IP founders.  _(Mondaq; LCK)_

**AUDIT FLASH POINT** — the nexus rule ties the benefit to genuine R&D substance in Cyprus; acquired IP with no local development does not qualify. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm qualifying-asset definitions and the nexus fraction.]**

## Section 5 -- Personal Reliefs & Exemptions

**Section 5 -- Personal Reliefs & Exemptions**

| Relief | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| 0% band | Income up to €19,500 (2025) / €22,000 (2026 reform) is tax-free. |
| Expat / first-employment relief | 50% exemption for high-earning new residents (above a salary threshold) for a number of years; a separate 20% relief exists for others. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current thresholds and durations after the 2026 reform.]** |
| Foreign pension | Taxed at a flat 5% above EUR 5,000 from 1 January 2026 (taxpayer may elect annually to be taxed under normal PIT rates instead). |
| Life insurance / provident / social insurance | Deductible up to a capped percentage of income. |

## Section 6 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Substance & management** — A Cyprus company must be genuinely managed and controlled in Cyprus (board, decisions, substance) to be Cyprus-resident and to benefit. Letterbox companies are challengeable.
- **Non-dom residency must be real** — Meet the day-count and tie tests; don't fabricate residency.
- **IP Box needs real R&D** — Nexus approach; no benefit for parked, acquired IP.
- **ATAD GAAR / anti-abuse** — ATAD GAAR / anti-abuse applies to arrangements whose main purpose is a tax advantage without substance.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Non-dom 0% SDC without residency confirmation** — NEVER present non-dom 0% SDC without confirming genuine Cyprus tax residency (60-day or 183-day test).
- **IP Box 3% without nexus condition** — NEVER present the IP Box 3% without the R&D-nexus / substance condition.
- **Substance-free company as tax shell** — NEVER advise a substance-free Cyprus company as a tax shell.
- **Contradicting other skills' rates** — NEVER contradict the rates/bands in `cyprus-income-tax.md` / `cyprus-social-contributions.md`.
- **Research gap figures presented as confirmed** — NEVER present any [RESEARCH GAP] figure as confirmed, nor present optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Cyprus tax adviser.
