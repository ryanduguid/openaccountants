Items marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** were not confirmed from a primary/Big-4 source and MUST be verified against the SAT ISR Law or IGSS/Código Tributario text before any filing.

### 1.1 ISR — Employment Income (Renta del Trabajo en Relación de Dependencia)

Applies to individuals working in a dependency relationship (employees). Brackets per **Article 73, Decreto 10-2012** ([PwC Guatemala — Taxes on personal income](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/guatemala/individual/taxes-on-personal-income), reviewed 9 Jan 2026; [Vesco Consultores — ISR empleados](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/)):

| Annual taxable income (GTQ) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — 300,000 | 5% | Q15,000 |
| Over 300,000 | Q15,000 fixed + 7% on excess | — |

**Formula:** tax = 5% on the first Q300,000; income above Q300,000 pays Q15,000 + 7% of the excess.

### 1.2 ISR — Self-Employment / Business / Professional Income (Rentas de Actividades Lucrativas)

Self-employed individuals and professionals choose ONE of two regimes (Decreto 10-2012):

**(a) Régimen Opcional Simplificado Sobre Ingresos** — tax on **gross income**, no expense deductions. Paid **monthly**. (Source: [PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/guatemala/individual/taxes-on-personal-income); [Grupo Macsol](https://grupomacsol.com/regimen-opcional-simplificado-sobre-ingresos-de-actividades-lucrativas/); [inbers.com](https://inbers.com/isr-regimen-opcional-simplificado-sobre-ingresos-o-regimen-mensual-del-isr/))

| Monthly gross income (GTQ) | Marginal rate | Cumulative tax at top of band |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — 30,000 | 5% | Q1,500 |
| Over 30,000 | Q1,500 fixed + 7% on excess | — |

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The **Q30,000 monthly threshold** is reported consistently by Guatemalan advisory sources (Grupo Macsol, inbers) but was NOT confirmed directly from PwC/SAT. The 5%/7% rates and Q1,500 fixed amount mirror the statutory Article-44 structure of Decreto 10-2012. Verify the threshold against the SAT ISR Law text before publishing.

**(b) Régimen Sobre Utilidades de Actividades Lucrativas** — **25%** on net profit (income minus deductible costs/expenses). Quarterly payments; annual return due **31 March**. (Source: [PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/guatemala/individual/taxes-on-personal-income); [Concilia](https://concilia.com.gt/regimen-ingresos-vs-utilidades/))

| Net profit | Rate |
|---|---|
| All net profit | 25% |

### 1.3 Pequeño Contribuyente (Small Taxpayer — IVA/ISR combined)

Flat **5% of monthly gross income**; replaces separate IVA and ISR returns. (Source: [Prensa Libre](https://www.prensalibre.com/economia/regimen-de-pequeno-contribuyente-en-guatemala-que-es-que-significa-ventajas-y-nuevo-limite-de-facturacion-en-2025/); [inbers.com](https://inbers.com/eres-pequeno-contribuyente-esto-es-lo-que-debes-saber-del-nuevo-limite-de-facturacion-en-2025/))

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Rate | 5% of monthly gross income |
| Annual billing limit | Q465,381.25 (= 125 monthly non-agricultural minimum wages of Q3,723.05), Decreto 31-2024, effective 9 Apr 2025 |
| Invoicing | Must issue invoices for sales/services over Q50; keep only a Purchases & Sales book |
| Exceeding the limit | Must register in the General IVA Regime the following month (or SAT does so de oficio) |

### 1.4 VAT (IVA) — context for self-employed registration

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Standard IVA rate | 12% ([PwC](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/guatemala/individual/taxes-on-personal-income)) |
| Pequeño Contribuyente rate | 5% (see 1.3) |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown income type (employment vs self-employment) | STOP — do not apply a regime without knowing |
| Unknown self-employment regime | Optional Simplified (gross income, 5%/7%) — the SAT default if not elected otherwise |
| Unknown whether IVA credit (Planilla) was filed | Q0 IVA credit |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Personal deduction documentation | Q48,000 standard requires no docs; apply it. Anything above it must be supported |
| Unknown IGSS applicability | Assume employee in formal dependency = IGSS applies |

---

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of income type (employee / self-employed) and, for self-employed, which regime applies (Optional Simplified, Profit, or Pequeño Contribuyente).

**Recommended** — payslips (recibo de salario) showing IGSS withholding and bonificación incentivo; sales invoices (facturas) and purchase receipts; Planilla del IVA confirmation; prior-year SAT-1431 or regime declarations; IGSS contribution records.

**Ideal** — complete income/expenditure account; asset register (Profit Regime); RetenISR projection from the employer; provisional/quarterly payment confirmations; any other Guatemala-source income.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that income is correctly classified by regime, that the Q48,000 personal deduction and any IVA credit are properly supported, and that only Guatemala-source income is included."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-GT-1 — Income type unknown.** "ISR is split into separate categories. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing whether the client earns employment income (renta del trabajo) or self-employment/business income (rentas de actividades lucrativas). Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-GT-2 — Companies / sociedades.** "This skill covers individual taxpayers (employees, sole proprietors, professionals) only. Sociedades anónimas and other entities file corporate ISR. Escalate to a Guatemalan CPA."

**R-GT-3 — Foreign-source income.** "Guatemala uses a territorial system — only Guatemala-source income is taxed. Foreign-source income, expatriate, and double-taxation questions are out of scope. Escalate to a Guatemalan CPA."

**R-GT-4 — Capital income / property disposals.** "Rentas de capital and capital-gains computations are a separate ISR category with different rates. Out of scope. Escalate to a Guatemalan CPA."

**R-GT-5 — Arrears / SAT enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to SAT enforcement. Mora accrues at 0.005 per day of the unpaid tax plus resarcitorio interest. Do not advise. Escalate to a Guatemalan CPA immediately."

**R-GT-6 — IVA return requested.** "This skill covers income tax (ISR) only — except for the combined Pequeño Contribuyente 5%. For a standalone General Regime IVA return, escalate to a Guatemalan CPA or a dedicated IVA skill."

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement (Spanish terms expected). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Abonos)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SALARIO, SUELDO, NÓMINA, PLANILLA, [employer name] | Employment income (renta del trabajo) | Goes to the employment ISR computation, NOT self-employment |
| AGUINALDO | Employment income — exempt up to one month's salary | Excess over one month's salary is taxable |
| BONO 14, BONO CATORCE | Employment income — exempt up to one month's salary | Excess over one month's salary is taxable |
| BONIFICACIÓN INCENTIVO, BONIF INCENTIVO | Q250/month — NOT subject to ISR or IGSS | Decreto 78-89; exclude from ISR base and IGSS base |
| HONORARIOS, SERVICIOS PROFESIONALES, FACTURA | Self-employment gross income | Rentas de actividades lucrativas — apply elected regime |
| TRANSFERENCIA [client], PAGO [client], DEPÓSITO [client] | Self-employment gross income | Business income — match to facturas |
| STRIPE, PAYPAL, WISE, PAYONEER PAYOUT | Self-employment gross income | Platform payout — match to underlying invoices |
| UPWORK, FIVERR | Self-employment gross income | Freelance platform — net of platform commission |
| ALQUILER RECIBIDO, RENTA RECIBIDA | Rental / capital income | Separate ISR category — flag, out of standard scope (R-GT-4) |
| INTERESES, INTERÉS | Capital income | Separate ISR category — flag |
| DEVOLUCIÓN SAT, REINTEGRO ISR | EXCLUDE | Tax refund from a prior year |

### 3.2 Expense Patterns (Debits / Cargos) — Deductible only in the PROFIT regime (25%)

> Expenses are deductible ONLY under the Régimen Sobre Utilidades. Under the Optional Simplified or Pequeño Contribuyente regimes, tax is on **gross income** and these expenses give NO deduction.

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| ALQUILER OFICINA, RENTA LOCAL | Office rent | Deductible (Profit regime) | Dedicated business premises |
| CONTADOR, AUDITOR, HONORARIOS CONTABLES | Accountancy fees | Deductible (Profit regime) | |
| ABOGADO, NOTARIO, LEGAL | Legal fees | Deductible (Profit regime) | Must be business-related |
| PAPELERÍA, ÚTILES, OFICINA | Office supplies | Deductible (Profit regime) | |
| PUBLICIDAD, MARKETING, GOOGLE ADS, META ADS | Marketing/advertising | Deductible (Profit regime) | |
| COMISIÓN BANCARIA, CARGO BANCARIO | Bank charges | Deductible (Profit regime) | Business account only |
| ENERGUATE, EEGSA, AGUA, INTERNET (business) | Utilities | Deductible (Profit regime), apportion if mixed | Business-use portion only |
| CLARO, TIGO, TELÉFONO | Telecoms | Deductible (Profit regime), business % only | |

### 3.3 Expense Patterns (Debits) — Deductions allowed in the EMPLOYMENT computation

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| IGSS, CUOTA LABORAL, SEGURO SOCIAL | IGSS employee contribution | Deductible from employment income | 4.83% of salary; fully deductible |
| SEGURO DE VIDA, PRIMA SEGURO VIDA | Life insurance premium | Deductible (non-dotal policies) | Employee's proportional portion |
| DONACIÓN [State/university/cultural] | Donation | Deductible — unlimited | To State / universities / cultural entities |
| DONACIÓN [nonprofit/foundation] | Donation | Deductible — capped at 5% of gross income | Nonprofits/foundations |
| IVA personal purchases (via Planilla) | IVA credit | Credit capped at Q12,000/year | Requires Planilla del IVA filed by 10 January |

### 3.4 Expense Patterns (Debits) — NOT Deductible

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| RESTAURANTE, COMIDA, ENTRETENIMIENTO | Entertainment / personal meals | NOT deductible | Personal living costs |
| SUPERMERCADO, PAIZ, LA TORRE, DESPENSA, GROCERIES | Personal expenses | NOT deductible | Private living costs |
| MULTA, SANCIÓN | Fines/penalties | NOT deductible | Public policy |
| PAGO ISR, PAGO SAT, IMPUESTO | Tax payments | NOT deductible | Income tax cannot reduce income |
| RETIRO, CAJERO, ATM (personal) | Drawings | NOT deductible | Not an expense |

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Employee, salary below the Q300,000 band

**Input lines (monthly, Banco Industrial):**
`28/02/2025 ; BI ABONO ; SALARIO FEBRERO ; EMPRESA XYZ S.A. ; +8,000.00 ; GTQ`
`28/02/2025 ; BI ABONO ; BONIFICACIÓN INCENTIVO ; ; +250.00 ; GTQ`

**Reasoning:**
Salary Q8,000/month = Q96,000/year of taxable employment income. The Q250/month bonificación incentivo (Q3,000/year) is exempt from ISR (Decreto 78-89) — exclude it. Apply the Q48,000 standard personal deduction. IGSS employee deduction = 4.83% of Q96,000 = Q4,636.80 (deductible). Assume no Planilla del IVA filed → Q0 IVA credit.

- Taxable employment income = Q96,000
- Less Q48,000 personal deduction − Q4,636.80 IGSS = base of Q96,000 − Q52,636.80 = **Q43,363.20**
- Base is within the 0–300,000 band → ISR = 5% × Q43,363.20 = **Q2,168.16**

**Classification:** Annual ISR ≈ Q2,168.16 (Article 73, 5% band). Bonificación incentivo excluded.

### Example 2 — Employee, salary above the Q300,000 band, with IVA credit

**Input:** Annual taxable salary Q420,000. IGSS withheld = 4.83% × Q420,000 = Q20,286. Planilla del IVA filed claiming the full Q12,000 IVA credit. Q48,000 personal deduction.

**Reasoning:**
- Net taxable base = Q420,000 − Q48,000 − Q20,286 = **Q351,714**
- This exceeds Q300,000. ISR = Q15,000 (fixed on first 300,000) + 7% × (Q351,714 − Q300,000)
- = Q15,000 + 7% × Q51,714 = Q15,000 + Q3,619.98 = **Q18,619.98**
- Less Q12,000 IVA credit → **net ISR = Q6,619.98**

**Classification:** ISR before credit Q18,619.98; after Q12,000 IVA credit, Q6,619.98 due.

### Example 3 — Self-employed, Optional Simplified Regime (5%/7% on gross), low month

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; BAC PAGO ; HONORARIOS MARZO ; CLIENTE ABC ; +18,000.00 ; GTQ`

**Reasoning:**
Optional Simplified Regime taxes **gross income monthly**, no deductions. Monthly gross Q18,000 is within the 0–30,000 band → ISR = 5% × Q18,000 = **Q900**. Filed within the first 10 business days of April.

**Classification:** Monthly ISR = Q900 (5% band, gross income). No expenses deducted.

### Example 4 — Self-employed, Optional Simplified Regime, high month (above Q30,000)

**Input line:**
`30/04/2025 ; BI ABONO ; HONORARIOS ABRIL ; CLIENTE DEF ; +50,000.00 ; GTQ`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly gross Q50,000 exceeds the Q30,000 threshold. ISR = Q1,500 (fixed on first 30,000) + 7% × (Q50,000 − Q30,000) = Q1,500 + 7% × Q20,000 = Q1,500 + Q1,400 = **Q2,900**.

**Classification:** Monthly ISR = Q2,900. (Threshold flagged [RESEARCH GAP] — see Section 1.2.)

### Example 5 — Self-employed, Profit Regime (25% on net)

**Input:** Annual business income Q600,000; documented deductible costs/expenses Q360,000.

**Reasoning:**
Profit Regime: net profit = Q600,000 − Q360,000 = **Q240,000**. ISR = 25% × Q240,000 = **Q60,000**. Paid quarterly; annual SAT return due 31 March.

**Classification:** Annual ISR = Q60,000 (25% of net profit).

### Example 6 — Pequeño Contribuyente (5% flat)

**Input line:**
`20/05/2025 ; BANRURAL ABONO ; VENTA MAYO ; ; +25,000.00 ; GTQ`

**Reasoning:**
Pequeño Contribuyente pays a flat 5% of monthly gross, combining IVA and ISR. ISR/IVA = 5% × Q25,000 = **Q1,250**. Check the annual billing limit: if cumulative annual billing reaches Q465,381.25 the client must move to the General IVA Regime the following month (Decreto 31-2024).

**Classification:** Monthly combined tax = Q1,250.

### Example 7 — Bonificación incentivo (exclude from both ISR and IGSS)

**Input line:**
`30/06/2025 ; BI ABONO ; BONIFICACIÓN INCENTIVO JUNIO ; ; +250.00 ; GTQ`

**Reasoning:**
The Q250/month incentive bonus (Decreto 78-89) is not subject to ISR or IGSS. Exclude it from the ISR taxable base AND from the IGSS contribution base.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from ISR base and IGSS base.

---

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Territorial Principle

Only **Guatemala-source income** is taxable (Decreto 10-2012). Foreign-source income is excluded. If any income is foreign-source or its source is unclear, flag for reviewer (R-GT-3).

### 5.2 Income Classification by Category

ISR is split into separate categories. Classify FIRST:
- **Renta del trabajo** (employment in dependency) → brackets 5%/7%, Q15,000 pivot at Q300,000 (Article 73).
- **Rentas de actividades lucrativas** (self-employment/business/professional) → elected regime (Optional Simplified or Profit).
- **Rentas de capital** (rent, interest, dividends) → separate category, out of standard scope (R-GT-4).

### 5.3 Employment Income — Deductions (Article 73 / Decreto 10-2012)

| Deduction | Amount / cap | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard personal deduction | Q48,000/year, no documentation | [Vesco Consultores](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/) |
| IVA credit | VAT paid on personal purchases, capped Q12,000/year; requires Planilla del IVA filed by 10 January | [Vesco Consultores](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/) |
| IGSS employee contributions | Fully deductible | [Vesco Consultores](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/) |
| Life insurance premiums | Non-dotal policies, employee's proportional portion | [Vesco Consultores](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/) |
| Donations | Unlimited to State/universities/cultural entities; capped at 5% of gross income for nonprofits/foundations | [Vesco Consultores](https://vescco.tax/blog/todo-sobre-el-isr-empleados-guatemala/) |

**Exempt income:** Aguinaldo and Bono 14 are exempt up to one month's salary each. Bonificación incentivo (Q250/month, Decreto 78-89) is exempt from ISR entirely.

### 5.4 Employment Income — Computation

1. Sum gross taxable employment income for the year (exclude bonificación incentivo and the exempt portions of aguinaldo / Bono 14).
2. Subtract the Q48,000 personal deduction, IGSS contributions, life insurance, and donations within caps.
3. Apply the Article 73 brackets: 5% up to Q300,000; Q15,000 + 7% on the excess above Q300,000.
4. Subtract the IVA credit (max Q12,000) to get tax due.

### 5.5 Self-Employment Regimes

| Regime | Base | Rate | Filing |
|---|---|---|---|
| Optional Simplified (Sobre Ingresos) | Gross income, monthly, no deductions | 5% up to Q30,000/month; Q1,500 + 7% on excess **[RESEARCH GAP — confirm threshold]** | Within first 10 business days of following month, electronically |
| Profit (Sobre Utilidades) | Net profit (income − deductible costs) | 25% | Quarterly + annual return due 31 March |

**Once elected, the regime applies for the year.** Default to Optional Simplified if unknown.

### 5.6 Pequeño Contribuyente

Flat **5% of monthly gross income**, combines IVA + ISR. Annual billing limit **Q465,381.25** (Decreto 31-2024, effective 9 Apr 2025). Must issue invoices for sales over Q50. If the limit is exceeded, register in the General IVA Regime the following month.

### 5.7 Non-Deductible Expenses

| Expense | Reason |
|---|---|
| Personal living expenses (groceries, restaurants) | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| ISR itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Any expense (Simplified / Pequeño Contribuyente regimes) | Those regimes tax gross income — no expense deductions at all |

### 5.8 VAT (IVA) Interaction

| Scenario | ISR treatment |
|---|---|
| Standard IVA 12% collected on sales (General Regime) | Not income — exclude from gross income |
| Pequeño Contribuyente 5% | Combined IVA+ISR — single 5% on gross |
| IVA paid on personal purchases (employee) | May be claimed as the Q12,000 IVA credit via Planilla del IVA |

## Section 6 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Regime Election (Self-Employed)

- Choosing Optional Simplified (5%/7% gross) vs Profit (25% net) materially changes tax. Profit regime is usually better only when deductible expenses are high relative to revenue.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm which regime the client has actually elected with SAT, and whether a switch is advisable.

### 6.2 Home Office / Mixed-Use Expenses (Profit regime only)

- Only the business-use portion of rent, utilities, phone, internet is deductible.
- Must be a genuinely business-used space; mixed personal use must be apportioned reasonably and documented.

**Conservative default:** 0% deduction until reviewer confirms apportionment basis.

### 6.3 Motor Vehicle Business Use (Profit regime only)

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, and maintenance is deductible.
- Requires a usage log distinguishing business vs personal.

**Conservative default:** 0% business use until a log is provided.

### 6.4 IVA Credit (Planilla del IVA)

- The Q12,000 IVA credit requires the Planilla del IVA to be filed by **10 January**. If not filed, the credit is lost for the year.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the Planilla was filed and the VAT receipts support the claimed credit.

### 6.5 Aguinaldo / Bono 14 Exempt Portion

- Each is exempt up to one month's salary; any excess is taxable employment income.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the one-month reference salary and compute the taxable excess if any.

### 6.6 Donations Cap

- Donations to nonprofits/foundations are capped at 5% of gross income; donations to State/universities/cultural entities are unlimited.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm donee category and recompute the cap.

### IGSS Social Security Contributions

Total = **15.5%** of monthly salary (excluding bonificación incentivo). Rates in effect since September 2022 (IGSS acuerdo reforms); unchanged for 2025/2026. (Source: [PwC — Other taxes](https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/guatemala/individual/other-taxes); [Banco Industrial — IGSS 2026](https://www.corporacionbi.com/gt/bancoindustrial/productos-bi/cuanto-se-paga-de-igss-2026-seo/))

| Party | Rate |
|---|---|
| Employee (cuota laboral) | 4.83% |
| Employer (cuota patronal) | 10.67% |
| **TOTAL IGSS** | **15.50%** |

**Arithmetic check:** 4.83% + 10.67% = 15.50%. ✓

**Additional mandatory employer payroll charges (not IGSS):**

| Charge | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| IRTRA | 1% of payroll | [Remote People](https://remotepeople.com/countries/guatemala/hire-employees/payroll-tax/) |
| INTECAP | 1% of payroll | [Rivermate](https://www.rivermate.com/guides/guatemala/taxes) |
| IGSS employer | 10.67% | (above) |
| **Total employer payroll burden** | **12.67%** | |

**Arithmetic check:** 10.67% + 1% + 1% = 12.67%. ✓

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The IGSS **program-level breakdown** (Enfermedad y Maternidad / Accidentes / IVS split within the 4.83% and 10.67% totals) is reported inconsistently across secondary sources; the totals are confirmed but the per-program allocation is not. Verify against IGSS Acuerdo 1118/1123 before publishing. No IGSS earnings **ceiling** was found from an authoritative source — treat as "no ceiling" unless SAT/IGSS confirms otherwise.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Employee below the Q300,000 band.**
Input: Annual taxable salary Q96,000; IGSS 4.83% = Q4,636.80; Q48,000 personal deduction; no IVA credit; bonificación incentivo excluded.
Expected: base = Q96,000 − Q48,000 − Q4,636.80 = Q43,363.20. ISR = 5% × Q43,363.20 = **Q2,168.16**.

**Test 2 — Employee above the Q300,000 band with IVA credit.**
Input: Annual taxable salary Q420,000; IGSS Q20,286; Q48,000 deduction; Q12,000 IVA credit.
Expected: base = Q351,714. ISR = Q15,000 + 7% × Q51,714 = Q18,619.98. Less Q12,000 = **Q6,619.98 due**.

**Test 3 — Optional Simplified, low month.**
Input: Monthly gross Q18,000.
Expected: ISR = 5% × Q18,000 = **Q900**.

**Test 4 — Optional Simplified, high month.**
Input: Monthly gross Q50,000.
Expected: ISR = Q1,500 + 7% × Q20,000 = **Q2,900**. (Threshold Q30,000 [RESEARCH GAP].)

**Test 5 — Profit Regime.**
Input: Gross Q600,000; deductible expenses Q360,000.
Expected: net Q240,000. ISR = 25% × Q240,000 = **Q60,000**.

**Test 6 — Pequeño Contribuyente.**
Input: Monthly gross Q25,000.
Expected: combined IVA+ISR = 5% × Q25,000 = **Q1,250**. Check annual billing vs Q465,381.25 limit.

**Test 7 — Bonificación incentivo.**
Input: Q250/month incentive bonus included in the bank feed.
Expected: EXCLUDE from both ISR base and IGSS base (Decreto 78-89).

**Test 8 — Wrong regime, expenses claimed.**
Input: Optional Simplified client tries to deduct Q40,000 of office expenses.
Expected: Reject — gross-income regimes allow NO expense deductions. Tax stays on gross.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a regime without first confirming income type (employment vs self-employment)
- NEVER deduct business expenses under the Optional Simplified or Pequeño Contribuyente regimes — those tax gross income
- NEVER include bonificación incentivo in the ISR base or the IGSS base
- NEVER tax foreign-source income — Guatemala is territorial
- NEVER claim the Q12,000 IVA credit without confirming the Planilla del IVA was filed by 10 January
- NEVER exceed the Q48,000 personal deduction without supporting documentation
- NEVER allow ISR itself, fines, or personal drawings as deductions
- NEVER treat the Q30,000 Optional-Simplified threshold as confirmed — it is a [RESEARCH GAP]
- NEVER apply an IGSS ceiling — none was confirmed; treat contributions as uncapped pending review
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and flag [RESEARCH GAP] items
