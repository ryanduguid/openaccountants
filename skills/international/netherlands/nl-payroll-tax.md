### Werknemersverzekeringen (Employer Contributions) 2025 [T1]

| Premium | Rate | Max salary base (EUR) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWf (unemployment — general) | 2.64% (fixed) / 7.64% (flex) | EUR 66,956 | Fixed contract = lower rate |

| Table type | Application |
|---|---|
| White table (witte tabel) | Standard employment |
| Green table (groene tabel) | One-off payments, holiday allowance, bonuses |
| Anonymous table | No BSN or ID provided — 52% flat rate |

---

## Section 2 — Werkkostenregeling (WKR) — Work Cost Scheme

### Concept [T1]

The WKR allows employers to provide tax-free benefits to employees within a "free space" (vrije ruimte) budget. Benefits exceeding the free space are subject to 80% flat-rate employer tax (eindheffing).

### Vrije Ruimte 2025 [T1]

| Fiscal wage base (loonsom) | Free space percentage |
|---|---|
| First EUR 400,000 | 1.92% |
| Above EUR 400,000 | 1.18% |

**Example:** Employer with EUR 1,000,000 wage base:
- Free space = EUR 400,000 × 1.92% + EUR 600,000 × 1.18% = EUR 7,680 + EUR 7,080 = EUR 14,760

### WKR Categories [T1]

| Category | Treatment | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Gerichte vrijstellingen (targeted exemptions) | Fully exempt — do NOT count against vrije ruimte | Travel allowance (max EUR 0.23/km), training costs, verhuiskostenvergoeding, extraterritoriale kosten (30% ruling) |
| Nihilwaarderingen (nil valuations) | Valued at EUR 0 — do NOT count against vrije ruimte | Workplace facilities (coffee, fruit), work clothing required for job, tools used at workplace |
| Vrije ruimte (free space) | Counts against budget; excess taxed at 80% | Christmas gifts, company parties, non-targeted benefits, staff outings |
| Individueel belast (individually taxed) | Taxed as employee wage (not WKR) | Benefits employee chooses to have taxed individually |

### Gerichte Vrijstellingen — Key Amounts 2025 [T1]

| Exemption | Amount/Rule |
|---|---|
| Travel allowance (reiskostenvergoeding) | Max EUR 0.23 per km (no cap on distance) |
| Relocation allowance (verhuiskostenvergoeding) | Max EUR 7,750 + actual moving costs |
| Study/training costs | Fully exempt if related to (future) employment |
| Meals at workplace (maaltijden) | Valued at EUR 3.55 per meal (2025); excess over employee contribution = WKR |
| Extraterritoriale kosten (30% ruling) | 30% of salary exempt or actual extraterritorial costs |
| Work-from-home allowance (thuiswerkvergoeding) | EUR 2.35 per day (2025) |
| Internet/phone (if partly business) | Reasonable business portion exempt |

### Eindheffing (Flat-Rate Tax on Excess) [T1]

| Situation | Rate |
|---|---|
| Benefits exceeding vrije ruimte | 80% eindheffing (paid by employer) |
| Benefits exceeding EUR 2,400/occasion (gebruikelijkheidstoets) | Cannot use WKR — must be individually taxed |

**Gebruikelijkheidstoets:** A single benefit provision cannot exceed EUR 2,400 per employee per occasion under the WKR. If it does, it must be individually taxed or split.

---

## Section 3 — Filing Obligations and Deadlines

### Periodic Filing [T1]

| Obligation | Frequency | Deadline |
|---|---|---|
| Loonaangifte (payroll tax return) | Per pay period (monthly or 4-weekly) | Last day of month following pay period |
| Payment of loonheffingen | Per pay period | Same as filing deadline |
| Correctie loonaangifte | As needed | Within 5 years; penalties may apply after initial filing |

### Annual Obligations [T1]

| Obligation | Deadline | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Jaaropgave (annual statement to employees) | 28 February | Employer provides to each employee |
| WKR eindheffing determination | In first payroll return of following year | Determine if vrije ruimte exceeded; report 80% tax |
| Renseignementen (information returns) | Various | Third-party payments > EUR 5,000/year |

### Key Dates [T1]

| Event | Date |
|---|---|
| Payroll return deadline (monthly) | Last day of month + 1 month |
| Annual employer statement (jaaropgave) | 28 February |
| WKR assessment moment | 31 December (assess full year usage) |

## Section 4 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable:** Payroll run summary for the period. Employee count and contract types. Gross salary totals.

**Recommended:** Detailed payroll journal, WKR administration (benefits provided per category), sector classification for Whk, AWf contract type split.

**Ideal:** Full payroll software export, employment contracts, WKR policy document, expense claim registers, prior-year WKR reconciliation, UWV correspondence.

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-LH-1 — No payroll data available.** "Cannot compute loonheffingen without payroll run data. Provide at minimum gross salary totals per period."

**R-LH-2 — Contract types unclear.** "Cannot determine AWf rate (2.64% vs 7.64%) without confirmed contract types. Flag all employees as flex rate (conservative) until confirmed."

**R-LH-3 — WKR allocation undocumented.** "Cannot confirm vrije ruimte compliance without benefit-by-benefit administration. Flag for payroll advisor."

**R-LH-4 — Anonymous employee (no BSN).** "Must apply 52% anonymous rate. Cannot file normally without BSN and ID copy."

**R-LH-5 — 30% ruling status unclear.** "Cannot apply extraterritorial exemption without confirmed Belastingdienst ruling. Apply standard treatment."

## Section 5 — Computation Examples

### Example: Monthly Payroll Tax Computation

```
Given:
- Gross monthly salary: EUR 5,000
- Employee: permanent contract, below AOW age
- No special deductions

Step 1: Determine loonbelasting + premie volksverzekeringen
  → Use white monthly table from Belastingdienst
  → Approximate: EUR 5,000 × 35.82% = EUR 1,791 (first bracket)
  → Actual amount per tax table (includes heffingskortingen)

Step 2: Employer premiums:
  → AWf (permanent): EUR 5,000 × 2.64% = EUR 132
  → Aof: EUR 5,000 × 5.82% = EUR 291 (small employer)
  → Whk: EUR 5,000 × 1.50% = EUR 75 (example sector rate)
  → Zvw: EUR 5,000 × 6.57% = EUR 328.50

Step 3: Total employer cost above gross:
  → EUR 132 + EUR 291 + EUR 75 + EUR 328.50 = EUR 826.50

Step 4: Employee net (approximate):
  → EUR 5,000 − EUR 1,791 + heffingskortingen (from table) = net salary
```

### Example: WKR Assessment

```
Given:
- Annual wage base (fiscale loonsom): EUR 800,000
- Benefits provided: Christmas packages EUR 8,000, staff party EUR 5,000, bicycle scheme EUR 3,000

Step 1: Calculate vrije ruimte:
  → EUR 400,000 × 1.92% = EUR 7,680
  → EUR 400,000 × 1.18% = EUR 4,720
  → Total: EUR 12,400

Step 2: Determine which benefits count:
  → Christmas packages: EUR 8,000 (vrije ruimte)
  → Staff party: EUR 5,000 (vrije ruimte)
  → Bicycle scheme: EUR 3,000 (vrije ruimte — not a gerichte vrijstelling)
  → Total allocated: EUR 16,000

Step 3: Excess:
  → EUR 16,000 − EUR 12,400 = EUR 3,600

Step 4: Eindheffing:
  → EUR 3,600 × 80% = EUR 2,880 (employer pays)
```

## Section 6 — Control Checks and Red Flags

| Check | Issue if triggered |
|---|---|
| AWf rate mismatch vs contract type | Incorrect premium — back-payment risk |
| WKR benefit > EUR 2,400 per person per occasion | Gebruikelijkheidstoets failed — must individually tax |
| Vrije ruimte exceeded without eindheffing | Missing tax payment |
| Employee hours > 130% of contracted hours | AWf low rate at risk (herzieningsregeling) |
| Late filing (> 1 month) | EUR 65 fine per return; escalates |
| Missing jaaropgave | Employee cannot file IB return correctly |
| DGA on payroll below EUR 56,000 | Gebruikelijk loon non-compliance |
| No written employment contracts | All employees default to flex AWf rate |

---

## Section 7 — Official Source Verification Requirements

Before any rate, threshold, or deadline is used in output:

1. Verify payroll filing instructions on `belastingdienst.nl/loonheffingen`
2. Verify premium rates in the annual "Nieuwsbrief Loonheffingen" (Belastingdienst)
3. Verify statutory text on `wetten.overheid.nl` (Wet LB 1964, Wfsv)
4. Record exact URL and retrieval date (YYYY-MM-DD)
5. If source unavailable or conflicting: mark as **UNVERIFIED** and require professional confirmation

## Section 8 — Escalation Points

Escalate to a qualified salarisadviseur or belastingadviseur when:

- Employee/contractor classification (dienstverband vs. opdracht) is unclear
- 30% ruling eligibility or application questions
- Cross-border employment (posting, frontier worker, split payroll)
- Payroll corrections affecting multiple prior periods
- Werknemersverzekeringen premium disputes with UWV
- WKR exceeds vrije ruimte by material amount (> EUR 10,000)
