## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Loonheffing)

Loonheffing combines wage tax (loonbelasting) and national insurance premiums (premies volksverzekeringen) into a single withholding. The employer withholds based on published tax tables (white or green table) using the loonheffingskorting (payroll tax credit) if applicable.

### Combined Brackets -- Under State Pension Age (2026)

| Bracket | Annual Wage (EUR) | Combined Rate | Composition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 -- 38,883 | 35.75% | 8.10% tax + 17.90% AOW + 0.10% Anw + 9.65% Wlz |
| 2 | 38,883 -- 78,426 | 37.56% | 37.56% tax only |
| 3 | 78,426+ | 49.50% | 49.50% tax only |

### Combined Brackets -- At or Above State Pension Age (2026)

| Bracket | Annual Wage (EUR) | Combined Rate | Composition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0 -- 38,883 | 17.85% | 8.10% tax + 0.10% Anw + 9.65% Wlz |
| 2 | 38,883 -- 78,426 | 37.56% | Tax only |
| 3 | 78,426+ | 49.50% | Tax only |

AOW-age recipients do not pay AOW premie (17.90%), reducing the bracket 1 rate.

### Loonheffingskorting (Payroll Tax Credits -- 2026)

Employees may request the loonheffingskorting via only one employer (prevents double credit). Key credits:

| Credit | Maximum Amount (EUR) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Algemene heffingskorting (general) | ~3,362 | Phases out above ~24,813; zero at ~78,426 |
| Arbeidskorting (employment credit) | ~5,599 | Phases out above ~43,071; zero at ~124,935 |
| Ouderenkorting (elderly) | ~1,963 | For AOW-age recipients; phases out at higher income |

### 30% Ruling (Extraterritorial Costs)

Qualifying inbound employees may receive up to 27% of their employment income (capped at the Balkenende norm ~EUR 233,000) tax-free for a maximum of 5 years. The ruling phases down: 27% in year 1-2, then 18% year 3, then 9% year 4-5.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security: Employee Deductions

Employee deductions in the Netherlands are primarily collected through the combined loonheffing (bracket 1 includes AOW, Anw, Wlz premiums). There are no separate employee premiums for WW or WAO/WIA -- those are employer-only.

### National Insurance Premiums Embedded in Loonheffing (2026)

| Premium | Rate | Ceiling | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AOW (state pension) | 17.90% | Bracket 1 only (up to EUR 38,883) | Not payable at/above AOW age |
| Anw (surviving dependants) | 0.10% | Bracket 1 only | |
| Wlz (long-term care) | 9.65% | Bracket 1 only | |

### Zorgverzekeringswet (ZVW) -- Health Insurance

| Type | Rate (2026) | Maximum Income |
|---|---|---|
| Werkgeversheffing (employer levy, standard) | 6.10% | EUR 79,409 |
| Werknemersbijdrage (employee/DGA contribution) | 4.85% | EUR 79,409 |

Most employees pay the werkgeversheffing (employer levy form), which is technically paid by the employer but treated as taxable wage. DGAs (directeur-grootaandeelhouder) and certain others pay the lower employee rate, which is withheld from gross pay.

---

## Section 4 -- Social Security: Employer Contributions

Employer contributions are calculated on the SV-loon (social insurance wage) up to the maximum premium wage (maximumpremieloon).

### Employer-Only Premiums (2026)

| Premium | Rate | Maximum Premium Wage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| AWf low (WW -- permanent/indefinite contracts) | 2.74% | EUR 79,409 | Indefinite contracts, written, not on-call |
| AWf high (WW -- flexible/temporary contracts) | 7.74% | EUR 79,409 | Fixed-term, on-call, no written contract |
| Aof low (WAO/WIA -- small employers) | 6.27% | EUR 79,409 | Employer < 25× avg premium wage |
| Aof high (WAO/WIA -- large employers) | 7.63% | EUR 79,409 | Employer ≥ 25× avg premium wage |
| Whk (return-to-work fund) | ~1.52% avg | EUR 79,409 | Differentiated per employer |
| Wko (childcare surcharge) | 0.50% | EUR 79,409 | |
| Ufo (flex workers fund) | 0.68% | EUR 79,409 | |
| ZVW werkgeversheffing | 6.10% | EUR 79,409 | Also counted as employer cost |

### Total Indicative Employer Cost (2026)

| Scenario | Approximate Rate |
|---|---|
| Small employer, permanent staff (AWf low + Aof low + Whk avg + Wko + Ufo + ZVW) | ~17.81% |
| Large employer, temporary staff (AWf high + Aof high + Whk avg + Wko + Ufo + ZVW) | ~24.17% |

These are on top of gross salary. The actual Whk rate is employer-specific and communicated by the Belastingdienst.

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1 -- Standard Monthly Employee (Indefinite Contract)

Gross monthly salary EUR 4,000. Under AOW age. Loonheffingskorting applied.

1. Loonheffing: computed from tax tables (approx. 35.75% on first EUR 3,240/month minus heffingskorting)
2. ZVW werkgeversheffing: EUR 4,000 × 6.10% = EUR 244 (added to taxable wage, then employer cost)
3. Employer AWf low: EUR 4,000 × 2.74% = EUR 109.60
4. Employer Aof: EUR 4,000 × 6.27% = EUR 250.80
5. Pension: per fund; typical employee contribution 4--6% of pensionable salary

### Pattern 2 -- Temporary Contract Employee

Same gross but AWf high rate applies: EUR 4,000 × 7.74% = EUR 309.60. Employer cost difference: EUR 200/month higher vs permanent contract. This incentivises permanent contracts.

### Pattern 3 -- Holiday Allowance Payment (May)

Employee earns EUR 48,000/year. Vakantiegeld = EUR 48,000 × 8% = EUR 3,840. Paid in May as a separate component. Subject to loonheffing at the special table rate (bijzondere beloningen).

### Pattern 4 -- 30% Ruling Employee

Gross salary EUR 6,000/month. 27% is extraterritorial allowance = EUR 1,620 tax-free. Taxable wage = EUR 4,380. Loonheffing calculated on EUR 4,380 only. The employee must meet the minimum salary requirement (EUR 44,192 for 2026; EUR 33,567 for under-30 with MSc).

### Pattern 5 -- Sick Employee (Week 1--52)

Employee earning EUR 3,500/month falls ill. Employer pays 70% = EUR 2,450. CAO requires 100% in year 1, so employer pays EUR 3,500. Employer must continue all social security premiums on the actual wage paid.
