## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Précompte Professionnel)

### Annual Income Tax Brackets (Income Year 2026, AY 2027)

| Taxable Income (EUR) | Marginal Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 16,720 | 25% |
| 16,721 -- 29,510 | 40% |
| 29,511 -- 51,070 | 45% |
| 51,071+ | 50% |

### Withholding Tax Mechanism

The précompte professionnel is NOT a simple application of the above brackets. It is calculated via Annex III of AR/CIR 92, which uses a progressive key formula accounting for:

- Gross taxable remuneration (after ONSS deduction)
- Family situation (single, married one income, married two incomes)
- Number of dependent children
- Disability status
- Flat-rate professional expense deduction (automatically applied)
- Tax-free allowance (quotité exemptée / belastingvrije som): EUR 10,570 base (2026)

### Key Withholding Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| Calculation base | Gross salary minus 13.07% ONSS = taxable base |
| Work bonus (werkbonus) | Reduces ONSS for low earners (gross < ~EUR 2,900/month) |
| Fiscal work bonus | Reduces withholding tax proportional to social work bonus |
| Holiday pay | Taxed separately at special withholding rates |
| 13th month / end-of-year premium | Taxed at exceptional rate (often higher marginal) |
| Double holiday pay | Upper portion taxed at 85% rate for withholding |

### Withholding Reductions

| Reduction | Amount (2026) |
|---|---|
| Per dependent child (1st) | EUR 48/month reduction |
| Per dependent child (2nd) | EUR 133/month |
| Per dependent child (3rd+) | EUR 299/month each |
| Disabled dependent | Additional EUR 48/month |

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security: Employee Deductions

| Contribution | Rate | Base | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal ONSS/RSZ | 13.07% | Gross salary | No cap |
| Special social security contribution | EUR 9.30 -- 60.94/month | Based on family income | Max EUR 731.28/year |

### Work Bonus (Werkbonus / Bonus à l'emploi)

Low-wage earners receive a reduction on personal ONSS contributions:
- Applies to monthly gross salary below approximately EUR 2,900
- Maximum reduction: ~EUR 280/month (decreasing as salary increases)
- Effectively reduces the 13.07% burden for minimum-wage workers

### Key Rules

- Personal ONSS is deducted BEFORE calculating taxable income for withholding tax
- ONSS applies to ALL remuneration: salary, premiums, bonuses, benefits in kind (BIK)
- No upper ceiling on employee contributions
- ONSS is tax-deductible (reduces the withholding base)

---

## Section 4 -- Social Security: Employer Contributions

| Contribution | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Basic employer ONSS | ~25.00% | Funds pensions, healthcare, unemployment, etc. |
| Special contributions (Closure Fund, Asbestos, etc.) | ~2-3% | Sector-dependent |
| **Total employer ONSS** | **~27-28%** | Varies by sector and joint committee (CP/PC) |

### Employer Contribution Cap (from 1 July 2025)

| Parameter | Detail |
|---|---|
| Cap threshold | EUR 85,000 gross per quarter per employee |
| Scope | Basic employer contributions (~25%) only |
| Excluded from cap | Special contributions (~3%), employee contributions (13.07%) |
| Indexation | 2% each time health index increases by 2% |
| Part-time workers | Full EUR 85,000 threshold (not pro-rated) |

### Structural Reduction (Structurele vermindering)

Employers receive an automatic reduction on ONSS contributions calculated via a formula based on reference salary relative to high/low wage ceilings. This reduces the effective employer cost, particularly for low-wage and high-wage workers.

### Target Group Reductions

| Target Group | Reduction |
|---|---|
| First hires (1st employee) | Full basic ONSS exemption for unlimited period |
| Young workers (< 26, low-qualified) | Significant quarterly reduction |
| Older workers (55+) | Quarterly reduction based on age bracket |
| Long-term unemployed | Quarterly reduction for 2+ years registered |

## Section 9 -- Common Payroll Patterns

### Pattern 1: Standard Monthly Salary (White-Collar, Single, No Children)

```
Gross monthly salary:                EUR 3,500.00
- ONSS employee (13.07%):           -EUR   457.45
= Taxable base:                      EUR 3,042.55

+ Employer ONSS (~27%):             +EUR   945.00

```

### Pattern 2: Minimum Wage Worker (With Work Bonus)

```
Gross monthly salary:                EUR 2,189.81
- ONSS employee (13.07%):           -EUR   286.21
+ Work bonus:                       +EUR   ~180.00
= Effective ONSS deduction:         -EUR   106.21
= Taxable base:                      EUR 2,083.60

= Net salary:                        EUR ~1,884.00
```

### Pattern 3: Holiday Pay Calculation

| Component | Calculation |
|---|---|
| Single holiday pay | Normal salary for days taken |
| Double holiday pay | 92% of gross monthly salary for full year of service |
| Timing | Paid by employer (white-collar) typically in May/June |
| ONSS on double holiday | 13.07% on the full 92% amount |
| Withholding on double holiday | Higher exceptional rate on upper portion |

### Pattern 4: Company Car Benefit in Kind

The taxable BIK for a company car is calculated using: CO2 reference emissions × 6/7 × catalogue value × age correction. This BIK is added to taxable income for withholding tax AND subject to employer solidarity contribution (CO2-based, minimum EUR 31.34/month).

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Skill | Interaction |
|---|---|
| belgium-bookkeeping | Payroll journal entries (620 accounts), accruals for holiday pay and 13th month |
| belgium-einvoice | No direct interaction (e-invoicing relates to B2B transactions, not payroll) |
| payroll-workflow-base | General payroll processing workflow; Belgium-specific overrides in this skill |

### Belgium-Specific Payroll Considerations

- **Indexation**: Belgian salaries are automatically indexed when the pivot index (based on health index) is exceeded. This is UNIQUE in Europe and means gross salaries increase without negotiation.
- **Joint Committees (CP/PC)**: Over 100 joint committees set sector-specific rules for minimum wages, premiums, working conditions, and benefits. ALWAYS identify the applicable CP/PC before processing payroll.
- **Language regions**: Administrative language (FR/NL/DE) affects document requirements but not calculation methodology.
- **Salary margin**: For 2025-2026, the salary margin (loonmarge/marge salariale) is 0% -- meaning no collective salary increases beyond automatic indexation are permitted.
