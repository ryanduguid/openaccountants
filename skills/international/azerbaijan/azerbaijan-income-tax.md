# Azerbaijan Income Tax -- Individuals & Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **CONFIDENCE: MEDIUM.** Several figures rely on Big-4 (PwC) and reputable local-firm summaries rather than direct extraction from the Azeri-language Tax Code, and the figures span a major regime change at 1 January 2026 (the 7-year private non-oil holiday expired 31 December 2025). Items marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** must be reconfirmed against the official portal at [taxes.gov.az](https://www.taxes.gov.az/en) before any return is filed.

### Personal Income Tax Brackets — 2025 (current tax year)

**Private non-oil/non-gas sector employees — 7-year holiday (1 Jan 2019 – 31 Dec 2025)** [PwC]

| Monthly income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 8,000 | 0% | AZN 0 |
| above 8,000 | 14% of the amount exceeding 8,000 | — |

*Example: AZN 10,000/month → 14% × (10,000 − 8,000) = AZN 280.*

**Oil/gas sector and government/public sector employees (also the standard rate after the holiday ends)** [PwC]

| Monthly income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,500 | 14% | AZN 350 |
| above 2,500 | AZN 350 + 25% of the amount exceeding 2,500 | — |

*Example: AZN 4,000/month → 350 + 25% × (4,000 − 2,500) = 350 + 375 = AZN 725.*

### Personal Income Tax Brackets — 2026 (CONFIRMED REFORM)

**Private non-oil/non-gas sector employees — NEW progressive regime, effective 1 Jan 2026** [Mercans]

| Monthly income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative tax at top |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 2,500 | 3% | AZN 75 |
| 2,501 -- 8,000 | 10% | AZN 625 |
| above 8,000 | 14% of the amount exceeding 8,000 | — |

*The lowest band rises to 5% in 2027 and 7% from 2028.* [Mercans]
*Example: AZN 5,000/month → (3% × 2,500) + (10% × 2,500) = 75 + 250 = AZN 325.*

> **2026 transition note.** From 1 Jan 2026 the holiday ends; **no income is fully exempt** for private non-oil employees. Apply the 3%/10%/14% schedule above. The interaction of the new progressive regime with the AZN 200/month personal exemption (Section 1, below) is **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the published 2026 Tax Code text.

### Self-Employed / Individual Entrepreneur Regimes — 2025

| Regime | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| General regime (entrepreneurial profit) | 20% on net taxable profit [ExpertSM] | Plus VAT if turnover exceeds AZN 200,000 |
| Simplified tax regime | 2% of gross revenue/turnover [ExpertSM] | Replaces PIT, profit tax, VAT, asset tax. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** — older sources cite 4% Baku / 2% regions; confirm current split with the State Tax Service |

### Personal Exemptions and Payroll Reference (2025)

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly wage | AZN 400/month (from 1 Jan 2025; unchanged into 2026) | APA |
| Personal monthly exemption (oil/gas & public sector, primary workplace, monthly income below AZN 2,500) | AZN 200/month (AZN 2,400/year where annual income below AZN 30,000) | GRATA |
| Withholding method | Employers withhold income tax + social/medical/unemployment at source (PAYE-style); withheld income tax transferred same day as payment | PwC |
| VAT standard rate | 18% | PwC |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Sector unknown for an employee | Treat as **private non-oil/non-gas** (dominant case) but FLAG: oil/gas/public faces the 14%/25% schedule and 22% employer DSMF |
| Tax year unknown | Confirm year. 2025 = holiday regime; 2026 = progressive regime. STOP if not confirmed |
| Simplified vs general regime unknown | Confirm with client; do not assume |
| Simplified tax rate unknown | 2% of gross turnover; flag for Baku 4% verification |
| Self-employed social-insurance % unknown | STOP — activity/region-dependent and not published in secondary sources **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) the tax year, (b) employment sector (private non-oil / oil-gas / public), or (c) self-employment regime (general 20% / simplified 2%).

**Recommended** -- payroll registers, DSMF / medical / unemployment contribution records, prior-year annual return, VAT registration status, monthly gross wage breakdown.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account for the entrepreneur, asset register, quarterly advance-payment confirmations, employment income details, and confirmation of micro-entrepreneur exemption eligibility.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without supporting records = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify the sector/regime, that all deductions are supported, and that the correct tax year's rates were applied."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-AZ-1 -- Tax year / sector unknown.** "Azerbaijan changed its personal income tax regime on 1 January 2026, and the rate depends on whether the employee is private non-oil, oil/gas, or public sector. This skill cannot compute tax without the tax year AND the sector. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-AZ-2 -- Self-employed social insurance.** "Self-employed / individual-entrepreneur social-insurance percentages are activity- and region-dependent and are not published in authoritative secondary sources. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm.] Escalate to an Azerbaijani tax professional for the exact rate."

**R-AZ-3 -- Companies and partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals and individual entrepreneurs only. Legal entities pay 20% corporate profit tax and file separately. Escalate to an Azerbaijani tax professional."

**R-AZ-4 -- Non-resident / cross-border income.** "Non-residents are taxed only on Azerbaijan-source income and withholding rates differ (dividends 5%, interest 10%, rent/royalties 14%, non-resident no-PE income generally 10%). Treaty analysis is out of scope. Escalate to an Azerbaijani tax professional."

**R-AZ-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to State Tax Service enforcement. Late-payment interest accrues at 0.1%/day and an understatement sanction of 50% of the underreported tax may apply (Article 58). Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-AZ-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Azerbaijan VAT (standard rate 18%, registration at AZN 200,000), use a dedicated VAT skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Private Non-Oil Employee, 2025 (Holiday Regime)

**Input line:**
`15.02.2025 ; KAPITAL BANK ; ƏMƏK HAQQI ; TECH STUDIO LLC FEB MAAŞ ; +6,000.00 ; AZN`

**Reasoning:**
Private non-oil/non-gas employee, monthly gross AZN 6,000, 2025 holiday regime. Income up to AZN 8,000 is taxed at **0%** [PwC]. Income tax = AZN 0. (Social/medical/unemployment contributions still apply — see Example 5.)

**Classification:** Monthly income tax = AZN 0 (holiday band).

### Example 2 -- Private Non-Oil Employee Above the Holiday Ceiling, 2025

**Input line:**
`28.02.2025 ; PASHA BANK ; MAAŞ ; FINTECH AZ LLC ; +10,000.00 ; AZN`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly gross AZN 10,000, private non-oil, 2025. First AZN 8,000 at 0%; excess taxed at 14% [PwC]. Tax = 14% × (10,000 − 8,000) = 14% × 2,000 = **AZN 280**.

**Classification:** Monthly income tax = AZN 280.

### Example 3 -- Oil/Gas Sector Employee, 2025

**Input line:**
`28.02.2025 ; ABB ; ƏMƏK HAQQI ; SOCAR DOWNSTREAM ; +4,000.00 ; AZN`

**Reasoning:**
Oil/gas sector employee, monthly gross AZN 4,000, 2025. Schedule: 14% up to AZN 2,500, then AZN 350 + 25% on the excess [PwC]. Tax = 350 + 25% × (4,000 − 2,500) = 350 + 375 = **AZN 725**. Employer DSMF on this sector is 22% of gross.

**Classification:** Monthly income tax = AZN 725.

### Example 4 -- Private Non-Oil Employee, 2026 (Progressive Reform)

**Input line:**
`31.01.2026 ; UNIBANK ; MAAŞ ; DESIGN HOUSE LLC ; +5,000.00 ; AZN`

**Reasoning:**
From 1 Jan 2026 the holiday is gone; the progressive schedule applies [Mercans]: 3% on the first AZN 2,500, then 10% on AZN 2,501–8,000. Tax = (3% × 2,500) + (10% × (5,000 − 2,500)) = 75 + 250 = **AZN 325**.

**Classification:** Monthly income tax = AZN 325.

### Example 5 -- DSMF Social Insurance, Private Non-Oil Employee, 2025

**Input line (gross wage):**
`AZN 6,000 monthly gross — private non-oil sector employee`

**Reasoning (employee DSMF):**
2025 private non-oil employee DSMF = 3% on the first AZN 200, then AZN 6 + 10% on the portion above AZN 200 [PwC]. Compute: 3% × 200 = AZN 6 (the stated AZN 6 base reconciles); plus 10% × (6,000 − 200) = 10% × 5,800 = AZN 580. Employee DSMF = 6 + 580 = **AZN 586**.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The PwC employer formula is stated as "2% on first AZN 200; **AZN 44** + 15% on the portion above AZN 200." Arithmetically, 2% × AZN 200 = AZN 4, not AZN 44, so the AZN 44 base does not reconcile to a 2% rate on the first AZN 200. Confirm the correct employer base figure with the State Tax Service before relying on it. Using the formula as published: employer DSMF on AZN 6,000 = 44 + 15% × 5,800 = 44 + 870 = **AZN 914** (per source, base unverified).

**Classification:** Employee DSMF = AZN 586 (verified); employer DSMF = AZN 914 per published formula (base flagged).

### Example 6 -- Individual Entrepreneur on the Simplified Regime, 2025

**Input line:**
`10.03.2025 ; LEOBANK ; XİDMƏT HAQQI ; CLIENT ABC ; +12,000.00 ; AZN`

**Reasoning:**
Individual entrepreneur under the simplified tax regime (annual turnover not exceeding AZN 200,000, not VAT-registered). Tax = 2% of gross turnover [ExpertSM/Deel]. On this AZN 12,000 receipt: 2% × 12,000 = **AZN 240**. The simplified tax replaces PIT, profit tax, VAT and asset tax.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** If the entrepreneur operates in Baku, older sources cite a 4% rate. Confirm the current statutory rate split with the State Tax Service before applying 2%.

**Classification:** Simplified tax = AZN 240 on this receipt.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residence and Scope

**Legislation:** Tax Code of the Republic of Azerbaijan

Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents are taxed only on Azerbaijan-source income [PwC]. Confirm residence before computing.

### 5.2 Personal Income Tax — 2025 by Sector

| Sector | Schedule (monthly) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Private non-oil/non-gas (holiday) | 0% up to AZN 8,000; 14% on the excess | PwC |
| Oil/gas + government/public | 14% up to AZN 2,500; AZN 350 + 25% on the excess | PwC |

The 7-year holiday ran 1 Jan 2019 – 31 Dec 2025 for private non-oil/non-gas employees [PwC].

### 5.3 Personal Income Tax — 2026 Reform (private non-oil)

From 1 Jan 2026 [Mercans]: 3% up to AZN 2,500; 10% on AZN 2,501–8,000; 14% above AZN 8,000. The lowest band rises to 5% in 2027 and 7% from 2028.

### 5.4 Social Insurance (DSMF) — 2025

| Party / sector | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employee — private non-oil | 3% on first AZN 200; AZN 6 + 10% above AZN 200 | PwC |
| Employer — private non-oil | 2% on first AZN 200; AZN 44 + 15% above AZN 200 **[base flagged — see Example 5]** | PwC |
| Employee — oil/gas & government | 3% of gross monthly salary | PwC |
| Employer — oil/gas & government | 22% of gross monthly salary | PwC |

**2026 reform:** the combined DSMF rate on the wage portion **above AZN 8,000** (private non-oil) drops from 25% to **21% (10% employee + 11% employer)**; the portion up to AZN 8,000 is unchanged [Mercans]. Self-check: 10% + 11% = 21% (combined column reconciles).

### 5.5 Unemployment Insurance Contribution (UIC) — 2025

| Party | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | 0.5% of gross salary | PwC |
| Employer | 0.5% of gross salary | PwC |
| **Combined** | **1.0%** | PwC |

Self-check: 0.5% + 0.5% = 1.0% (combined reconciles).

### 5.6 Compulsory Medical Insurance — 2025

| Income band | Employee | Employer | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to AZN 8,000 | 2% | 2% | PwC |
| Above AZN 8,000 | AZN 160 + 0.5% on the excess | AZN 160 + 0.5% on the excess | PwC |

Self-check: at exactly AZN 8,000, 2% × 8,000 = AZN 160 — so the AZN 160 base reconciles to the cap of the lower band for each party.

### 5.7 Self-Employed / Individual Entrepreneur

| Regime | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| General | 20% on net taxable profit [ExpertSM] | Plus VAT if turnover > AZN 200,000 |
| Simplified | 2% of gross turnover [ExpertSM/Deel] | Eligibility: turnover ≤ AZN 200,000 and not VAT-registered; replaces PIT, profit tax, VAT, asset tax |

**Self-employed social insurance** is activity- and region-dependent (minimum-wage-based multiples apply); exact percentages were not found in authoritative secondary sources **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** [PwC].

### 5.8 Withholding Tax on Non-Employment Income

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends | 5% | PwC |
| Interest | 10% | PwC |
| Rent / royalties | 14% | PwC |
| Non-resident, no-PE income (general) | 10% | PwC |
| Non-resident leasing / insurance | 4% | PwC |
| Non-resident telecom / transport | 6% | PwC |

### 5.9 VAT Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard VAT rate | 18% | PwC |
| Mandatory VAT registration | Taxable turnover > AZN 200,000 in any 12 consecutive months (or single transaction over the threshold) | PwC |
| VAT collected on sales (VAT-registered) | NOT income — exclude | — |
| Simplified-regime entrepreneur | Cannot be VAT-registered; VAT does not apply | ExpertSM/Deel |

### 5.10 Exemptions

| Exemption | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal monthly exemption (oil/gas & public, primary workplace) | AZN 200/month where monthly income below AZN 2,500 (AZN 2,400/year where annual income below AZN 30,000) | GRATA |
| Private non-oil employees (2025) | Were under the 0% holiday band rather than the AZN 200 exemption | PwC |
| Micro-entrepreneur 75% income exemption | See Section 6.1 | Caspian Legal Center |

### 5.11 Filing and Payment

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Private non-oil employee, 2025, under ceiling.**
Input: Private non-oil, monthly gross AZN 6,000, 2025.
Expected: Income tax = AZN 0 (0% holiday band, income ≤ 8,000).

**Test 2 -- Private non-oil employee, 2025, above ceiling.**
Input: Private non-oil, monthly gross AZN 10,000, 2025.
Expected: 14% × (10,000 − 8,000) = AZN 280.

**Test 3 -- Oil/gas employee, 2025.**
Input: Oil/gas, monthly gross AZN 4,000, 2025.
Expected: 350 + 25% × (4,000 − 2,500) = 350 + 375 = AZN 725.

**Test 4 -- Private non-oil employee, 2026, progressive.**
Input: Private non-oil, monthly gross AZN 5,000, 2026.
Expected: (3% × 2,500) + (10% × 2,500) = 75 + 250 = AZN 325.

**Test 5 -- Employee DSMF, private non-oil, 2025.**
Input: Monthly gross AZN 6,000.
Expected: 3% × 200 + 10% × 5,800 = 6 + 580 = AZN 586 (employee). Employer = AZN 914 per published formula but the AZN 44 base is FLAGGED for confirmation.

**Test 6 -- UIC combined.**
Input: Monthly gross AZN 3,000.
Expected: employee 0.5% × 3,000 = AZN 15; employer 0.5% × 3,000 = AZN 15; combined AZN 30 (1.0%).

**Test 7 -- Medical insurance, income above band.**
Input: Monthly gross AZN 10,000.
Expected (each of employee and employer): AZN 160 + 0.5% × (10,000 − 8,000) = 160 + 10 = AZN 170.

**Test 8 -- Simplified-regime entrepreneur.**
Input: Gross turnover receipt AZN 12,000, simplified regime.
Expected: 2% × 12,000 = AZN 240 (verify Baku rate before applying).

**Test 9 -- General-regime entrepreneur.**
Input: Net taxable profit AZN 50,000, no micro-entrepreneur exemption.
Expected: 20% × 50,000 = AZN 10,000.

**Test 10 -- Regime boundary.**
Input: Private non-oil wage AZN 7,000, December 2025 vs January 2026.
Expected: Dec 2025 = AZN 0 (holiday); Jan 2026 = (3% × 2,500) + (10% × (7,000 − 2,500)) = 75 + 450 = AZN 525.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply a rate schedule without knowing BOTH the tax year (2025 vs 2026) AND the sector/regime
- NEVER apply the 2025 holiday (0% to AZN 8,000) to income earned in 2026 or later
- NEVER assume a self-employed social-insurance percentage — it is activity/region-dependent and flagged as a research gap
- NEVER state a capital-asset depreciation rate without confirming it against the Tax Code
- NEVER apply the AZN 200/month personal exemption to private non-oil employees in 2025 (they were under the holiday, not the exemption)
- NEVER apply the micro-entrepreneur 75% exemption without confirming the listed-service, 50%, and AZN 45,000 conditions
- NEVER treat the simplified 2% rate as final for a Baku-based entrepreneur without verifying the rate split
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales as income
- NEVER allow fines, penalties, or income tax itself as a deduction
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and route through the deterministic engine
