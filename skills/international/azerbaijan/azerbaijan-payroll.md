# Azerbaijan Payroll Skill v0.1

> **Tier 2 — research-verified.** Figures below are sourced from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, the State Tax Service of Azerbaijan (taxes.gov.az), Mercans, Caspian Legal Center, APA.az and EY. They have **not** yet been signed off by a licensed Azerbaijani accountant. Any line marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** must be verified against the Tax Code before the output is relied upon.

> **TWO HARD BRANCHES BEFORE YOU COMPUTE ANYTHING.** Azerbaijani payroll depends on (1) the **tax year** and (2) the **employment sector**.
> - **Tax year:** 2025 is the **final year** of the 2019–2025 seven-year PIT holiday for the non-oil/gas private sector (0% PIT up to AZN 8,000/month). The holiday **expired 31 Dec 2025**; from **1 Jan 2026** a new progressive PIT and revised social/health thresholds apply. Do **not** apply 2026 brackets to 2025 wages, or vice versa (PwC — Significant developments).
> - **Sector:** "non-oil/gas, non-government **PRIVATE** sector" is the default and carries the holiday/subsidy rules. "**Oil/gas** sector" and "**government/state** sector" use the standard 14%/25% PIT and the 3%/22% SSPF split, which differ materially (PwC — Taxes on personal income; Other taxes).

**Conservative defaults (apply when an input is missing):**

| Ambiguity | Default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Tax year not stated | 2025 rules (holiday in force) | The requested year is 2025; the holiday applied for the full year (PwC — Significant developments) |
| Sector not stated | Non-oil/gas **private** sector | Most employers fall here; carries the holiday/subsidy rules (PwC) |

| State subsidy on private SSPF (through 2025) | Treat as 100% subsidised | Confirmed schedule, Law "On Social Insurance" / APA.az |
| State subsidy from 2026 | 80% (2026–2028) | Reduces per statutory schedule (APA.az) |
| Whether subsidy reduces remittance or is reimbursed | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** | Mechanism not confirmed from a fetched circular |

**Red-flag thresholds (escalate to a human accountant):**

| Threshold | Value |
|---|---|
| HIGH single monthly gross | AZN 8,000 (crosses every PIT/medical/SSPF band) |
| HIGH sector ambiguity | Any oil/gas or government indicator |
| MEDIUM tax-year straddle | Pay period spanning Dec 2025 / Jan 2026 |
| LOW conservative-default count | > 3 defaults applied in one run |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — gross monthly salary per employee, the **tax year**, and the **sector** (non-oil private / oil-gas / government). Acceptable bank statements from: Kapital Bank, PASHA Bank, International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA), AccessBank, Bank Respublika, Xalq Bank, or any other.

**Recommended** — employee VOEN (TIN), employment start date, prior-period unified declaration, confirmation of subsidy eligibility.

**Ideal** — full employee register with each person's sector flag, the company's SSPF registration, and the prior-month declaration for cumulative checks.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-AZ-P-1 — Self-employed / sole-trader income.** *Trigger:* individual not on an employer payroll (simplified-tax entrepreneur, freelancer). *Message:* "This skill covers **employer payroll** only. Self-employed taxation is out of scope — use a qualified practitioner."

**R-AZ-P-2 — Annual individual PIT return.** *Trigger:* user asks to file the annual personal return (foreign-source income, income not taxed at source). *Message:* "This skill covers monthly payroll withholding, not the annual individual PIT return (due 31 March). Out of scope."

**R-AZ-P-3 — Free economic / special zone payroll.** *Trigger:* Alat FEZ or other designated-zone employer. *Message:* "FEZ and special-regime employers have bespoke contribution rules. Out of scope — refer to a local practitioner."

**R-AZ-P-4 — Expatriate / cross-border split payroll.** *Trigger:* employee with tax residence outside Azerbaijan, treaty relief, or split-payroll arrangement. *Message:* "Cross-border residence and treaty allocation are out of scope. Refer to a cross-border specialist."

**R-AZ-P-5 — Pension / disability / benefit calculations.** *Trigger:* user asks to compute SSPF pension entitlement or sickness benefit. *Message:* "Benefit entitlement calculations are out of scope. This skill computes payroll contributions only."

**R-AZ-P-6 — VAT / corporate tax.** *Trigger:* user asks about EDV or profit tax. *Message:* "Use azerbaijan-vat for EDV and the corporate-tax skill for profit tax. This skill handles payroll only."

## Section 3 — Income Tax Withholding (PIT / Income Tax of Physical Persons)

The employer withholds PIT at source and **remits it on the same day** the income is paid to the employee (Tax Code; PwC — Tax administration). PIT is computed **monthly on taxable employment income** (gross salary). There is no separate personal allowance under the holiday regime — the **0% band IS the relief** for the private sector in 2025.

### 3.1 Non-oil/gas, non-government PRIVATE sector — **2025** (holiday, in force 2019 → 31 Dec 2025)

| Monthly taxable income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative monthly PIT |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 8,000 | 0% | 0 |
| Over 8,000 | 14% on the excess above 8,000 | 14% × (income − 8,000) |

*Source: PwC — Taxes on personal income & Significant developments. This holiday expired 31 Dec 2025; it is the relevant rule for the 2025 tax year.*

**Check:** at AZN 10,000 → 14% × (10,000 − 8,000) = 14% × 2,000 = **AZN 280**.

### 3.2 Oil/gas sector and government/state sector — standard rates (all years)

| Monthly taxable income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative monthly PIT |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,500 | 14% | 14% × income |
| Over 2,500 | AZN 350 + 25% on the excess above 2,500 | 350 + 25% × (income − 2,500) |

*Source: PwC — Taxes on personal income.*

**Cumulative check:** at AZN 2,500 → 14% × 2,500 = **AZN 350**, which is exactly the fixed amount carried into the second band — consistent. At AZN 5,000 → 350 + 25% × 2,500 = **AZN 975**.

### 3.3 Non-oil/gas PRIVATE sector — NEW progressive structure **from 1 Jan 2026** (replaces the expired holiday)

| Monthly taxable income (AZN) | Rate | Cumulative monthly PIT |
|---|---|---|
| 0 – 2,500 | 3% (rises to 5% in 2027, 7% from 2028) | 3% × income |
| 2,501 – 8,000 | AZN 75 + 10% on the excess above 2,500 | 75 + 10% × (income − 2,500) |
| Over 8,000 | AZN 625 + 14% on the excess above 8,000 | 625 + 14% × (income − 8,000) |

*Source: PwC — Significant developments; Mercans statutory alert; Caspian Legal Center (2026 amendments).*

**Cumulative checks:** at AZN 2,500 → 3% × 2,500 = **AZN 75** (matches band-2 base). At AZN 8,000 → 75 + 10% × 5,500 = 75 + 550 = **AZN 625** (matches band-3 base). Consistent.

**2026 low-income relief:** an **AZN 200/month** PIT exemption is reported where monthly income does not exceed AZN 2,500 (Caspian Legal Center). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm against the Tax Code text.]** This skill computes 2026 PIT **without** the AZN 200 relief by default (conservative); apply it only once verified.

## Section 4 — Social Insurance (SSPF / DSMF) — Employee and Employer

State social insurance is computed **monthly on gross salary**, split at the **AZN 200** threshold for the non-oil private sector. There is **no upper ceiling** (PwC — Other taxes).

### 4.1 Non-oil/gas PRIVATE sector — SSPF (2019–2025; wages ≤ AZN 8,000 continue on this split in 2026)

| Portion of gross | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| First AZN 200 | 3% | 2% |
| Above AZN 200 | AZN 6 + 10% on the excess | AZN 44 + 15% on the excess |

*Source: PwC — Other taxes.*

**Reconciliation note:** the employee base AZN 6 = 3% × 200 (consistent). The employer base **AZN 44 does NOT equal 2% × 200 (= AZN 4)** — AZN 44 is the legacy fixed amount (22% × 200) carried forward in the statutory formula, while the headline rate on the first band is quoted as 2%. PwC states both "2% on first AZN 200" and "AZN 44 base above AZN 200" together. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact statutory first-band employer figure: AZN 4 (2% × 200) or AZN 44 (legacy).]** This skill applies PwC's **AZN 44 + 15%** wording for the employer above-threshold computation.

**Worked check (AZN 1,000 gross):**
- Employee SSPF = 6 + 10% × (1,000 − 200) = 6 + 80 = **AZN 86**
- Employer SSPF = 44 + 15% × (1,000 − 200) = 44 + 120 = **AZN 164**

### 4.2 Oil/gas and government sectors — SSPF (standard, all years)

| Base | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary (no ceiling) | 3% | 22% |

*Source: PwC — Other taxes.*

### 4.3 High earners FROM 1 Jan 2026 (non-oil private) — wages above AZN 8,000

| Portion of gross | Employee | Employer | Combined |
|---|---|---|---|
| First AZN 8,000 | per §4.1 split | per §4.1 split | per §4.1 |
| Above AZN 8,000 | 10% | 11% | 21% |

*Source: Mercans statutory alert; PwC — Significant developments. The combined rate on the > AZN 8,000 portion falls from 25% to 21% from 2026.*

### 4.4 State subsidy on private-sector social insurance

| Period | Share of private-sector SSPF covered by state subsidy |
|---|---|
| 1 Jan 2023 – 31 Dec 2025 | 100% |
| 2026 – 2028 | 80% |
| 2029 – 2030 | 60% |
| 2031 – 2032 | 40% |

*Source: Law "On Social Insurance"; APA.az. Excludes oil/gas operations.* **Whether the subsidy reduces the amount remitted or is reimbursed separately is [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].**

## Section 5 — Unemployment Insurance Contribution (UIC) and Mandatory Medical Insurance

### 5.1 Unemployment Insurance Contribution (UIC) — all sectors (since 1 Jan 2018)

| Base | Employee | Employer | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 0.5% | 0.5% | 1% |

*Source: PwC — Other taxes; Mercans. Unchanged for 2026.*

### 5.2 Mandatory Medical (Health) Insurance — **2021–2025** regime

| Portion of gross | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| First AZN 8,000 | 2% | 2% |
| Above AZN 8,000 | AZN 160 + 0.5% on the excess | AZN 160 + 0.5% on the excess |

*Source: PwC — Other taxes (effective 1 Jan 2021).*

**Reconciliation:** base AZN 160 = 2% × 8,000 (consistent for both sides).

### 5.3 Mandatory Medical (Health) Insurance — **from 1 Jan 2026** (threshold lowered to AZN 2,500)

| Portion of gross | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| First AZN 2,500 | 2% | 2% |
| Above AZN 2,500 | 0.5% | 0.5% |

*Source: Mercans statutory alert; PwC — Significant developments; Caspian Legal Center. The total rate on the AZN 2,500–8,000 band drops from 4% to 1%. Exact wording (whether the 2% applies to the first AZN 2,500 only) is corroborated by Mercans and Caspian but the official confirmation circular was not fetched —* **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm].**

### 6.2 Oil/gas or government sector — **2025**, gross **AZN 5,000** (illustrative totals)

| Component | Employee | Employer | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| PIT (350 + 25%×2,500) | 975.00 | — | 975.00 |

| **Total deductions / contributions** | **1,250.00** | **1,225.00** | **2,475.00** |

*Employee column: 975 + 150 + 25 + 100 = 1,250.00. Employer column: 1,100 + 25 + 100 = 1,225.00. Total: 975 + 1,250 + 50 + 200 = 2,475.00. All reconcile. No state subsidy applies (oil/gas / government excluded).*

## Section 8 — Worked Examples

> All figures in AZN. Each example recomputed end-to-end. Bank-statement lines use the semicolon-delimited DD.MM.YYYY format common to Kapital Bank / PASHA Bank exports.

### Example 1 — Non-oil private, 2025, gross AZN 1,000 (holiday, below all thresholds)

**Input line:** `31.07.2025 ; EMEK HAQQI — Rashad M. ; DEBIT ; July salary ; gross 1,000.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 0% (≤ 8,000, holiday) = **0.00**
- SSPF employee: 6 + 10% × (1,000 − 200) = **86.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 1,000 = **5.00**
- Medical employee: 2% × 1,000 = **20.00**
- Employee deductions: 0 + 86 + 5 + 20 = **111.00**
- **Net pay: 1,000.00 − 111.00 = 889.00**
- Employer-side: SSPF 164.00 + UIC 5.00 + medical 20.00 = **189.00** (100% state-subsidised through 2025; mechanism [RESEARCH GAP])

### Example 2 — Non-oil private, 2025, gross AZN 10,000 (crosses PIT and medical thresholds)

**Input line:** `31.08.2025 ; MAAS — Leyla Q. ; DEBIT ; Aug salary ; gross 10,000.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 14% × (10,000 − 8,000) = **280.00**
- SSPF employee: 6 + 10% × (10,000 − 200) = 6 + 980 = **986.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 10,000 = **50.00**
- Medical employee: 2% × 8,000 + 0.5% × (10,000 − 8,000) = 160 + 10 = **170.00**
- Employee deductions: 280 + 986 + 50 + 170 = **1,486.00**
- **Net pay: 10,000.00 − 1,486.00 = 8,514.00**
- Employer-side: SSPF (44 + 15% × 9,800 = 44 + 1,470 = 1,514.00) + UIC 50.00 + medical 170.00 = **1,734.00**

### Example 3 — Oil/gas sector, 2025, gross AZN 5,000 (standard rates)

**Input line:** `31.09.2025 ; SALARY — Kamran A. (offshore) ; DEBIT ; Sep salary ; gross 5,000.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 350 + 25% × (5,000 − 2,500) = 350 + 625 = **975.00**
- SSPF employee: 3% × 5,000 = **150.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 5,000 = **25.00**
- Medical employee: 2% × 5,000 = **100.00**
- Employee deductions: 975 + 150 + 25 + 100 = **1,250.00**
- **Net pay: 5,000.00 − 1,250.00 = 3,750.00**
- Employer-side: SSPF 22% × 5,000 = 1,100.00 + UIC 25.00 + medical 100.00 = **1,225.00** (no subsidy — oil/gas excluded)

### Example 4 — Government sector, 2025, gross AZN 2,500 (band boundary)

**Input line:** `31.10.2025 ; EMEK HAQQI — public employee ; DEBIT ; Oct salary ; gross 2,500.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 14% × 2,500 = **350.00** (exactly at the boundary; the second band has not yet begun)
- SSPF employee: 3% × 2,500 = **75.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 2,500 = **12.50**
- Medical employee: 2% × 2,500 = **50.00**
- Employee deductions: 350 + 75 + 12.50 + 50 = **487.50**
- **Net pay: 2,500.00 − 487.50 = 2,012.50**
- Employer-side: SSPF 22% × 2,500 = 550.00 + UIC 12.50 + medical 50.00 = **612.50**

### Example 5 — Non-oil private, **2026**, gross AZN 3,000 (new progressive PIT + lowered medical threshold)

**Input line:** `31.01.2026 ; MAAS — Nigar S. ; DEBIT ; Jan salary ; gross 3,000.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 75 + 10% × (3,000 − 2,500) = 75 + 50 = **125.00** (AZN 200 low-income relief NOT applied — [RESEARCH GAP])
- SSPF employee (≤ 8,000 split continues): 6 + 10% × (3,000 − 200) = 6 + 280 = **286.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 3,000 = **15.00**
- Medical employee (2026 threshold 2,500): 2% × 2,500 + 0.5% × (3,000 − 2,500) = 50 + 2.50 = **52.50**
- Employee deductions: 125 + 286 + 15 + 52.50 = **478.50**
- **Net pay: 3,000.00 − 478.50 = 2,521.50**
- Employer-side: SSPF (44 + 15% × 2,800 = 44 + 420 = 464.00) + UIC 15.00 + medical 52.50 = **531.50** (state subsidy 80% from 2026; mechanism [RESEARCH GAP])

### Example 6 — Minimum wage employee, 2025, gross AZN 400 (non-oil private)

**Input line:** `31.06.2025 ; EMEK HAQQI — minimum wage ; DEBIT ; Jun salary ; gross 400.00 ; AZN`

- PIT: 0% (holiday) = **0.00**
- SSPF employee: 6 + 10% × (400 − 200) = 6 + 20 = **26.00**
- UIC employee: 0.5% × 400 = **2.00**
- Medical employee: 2% × 400 = **8.00**
- Employee deductions: 0 + 26 + 2 + 8 = **36.00**
- **Net pay: 400.00 − 36.00 = 364.00**

|---|---|
| A | Employee name |
| B | VOEN (TIN) |
| C | Sector (non-oil private / oil-gas / government) |
| D | Tax year + month |
| E | Gross monthly salary (AZN) |
| F | PIT base |
| G | PIT withheld (per §3 by sector/year) |
| H | SSPF employee (per §4) |
| I | SSPF employer (per §4) |

### 15.5 Change log

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the **2026 progressive PIT brackets to 2025 wages** — the holiday was in force for all of 2025 (expired 31 Dec 2025).
- NEVER apply the **2025 holiday (0% to AZN 8,000) to oil/gas or government** employees — they use 14%/25% standard rates.
- NEVER use the **non-oil private SSPF split (3%/2% with AZN 6/44 bases) for oil/gas or government** employees — they use 3% employee / 22% employer flat.
- NEVER **silently apply the AZN 200 (2026) low-income PIT relief** — it is a [RESEARCH GAP] until confirmed against the Tax Code.
- NEVER **assume the state subsidy reduces the remitted amount** — the mechanism is unconfirmed; present gross contributions and flag it.
- NEVER **delay PIT remittance** — it is due the same day wages are paid.
- NEVER **omit any of the four components** (PIT, SSPF, UIC, medical) from the unified monthly declaration.
- NEVER **miss the 20th-of-the-following-month** declaration deadline — penalties apply.
- NEVER **invent figures** — every rate/threshold must carry an inline citation or a [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] marker.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label them estimated and direct the user to a licensed Azerbaijani accountant.
