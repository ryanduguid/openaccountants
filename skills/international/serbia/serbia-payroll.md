## Confidence Tier Definitions

Every rule in this skill is tagged with a confidence tier:

- **[T1] Tier 1 -- Deterministic.** Apply exactly as written. No reviewer judgement required.
- **[T2] Tier 2 -- Reviewer Judgement Required.** Flag the issue and present options. A qualified Serbian tax adviser must confirm before filing.
- **[T3] Tier 3 -- Out of Scope / Escalate.** Skill does not cover this. Do not guess. Escalate and document the gap.

---

## Section 2 -- Salary Tax (Porez na Zarade)

Employment income is taxed at a **flat 10% salary tax** on the gross salary **less a monthly non-taxable amount**. The tax is a final withholding tax: the employer computes it, withholds it from the employee, and remits it. Source: Eurofast Tax Card 2025; KPMG RS; Forvis Mazars; PwC.

### Salary tax formula [T1]

```
Salary tax = (Gross salary − Monthly non-taxable amount) × 10%
```

- If gross salary is at or below the monthly non-taxable amount, salary tax = 0 (the base cannot go negative).
- The **non-taxable amount applies to actual gross salary**, NOT to the contribution base floor/ceiling (those affect contributions only -- see Section 3).

### Monthly non-taxable amount [T1]

| Period | Monthly non-taxable amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Prior to 1 Feb 2025 | RSD 25,000 | KPMG RS |
| 1 Feb 2025 -- 31 Jan 2026 | **RSD 28,423** | Eurofast; KPMG RS |
| From 1 Jan 2026 (index period Feb 2026) | **RSD 34,221** | KPMG RS tax alert (Dec 2025); Eurofast |

> **Note on the index period.** The non-taxable amount is re-indexed annually with effect from 1 February. RSD 28,423 is the figure for the Feb 2025 -- Jan 2026 cycle. For payrolls dated Feb 2025 through Jan 2026 use RSD 28,423; switch to RSD 34,221 for the 2026 cycle. Source: Eurofast caveat.

---

## Section 3 -- Social Insurance Contributions (Doprinosi)

Total mandatory social insurance contributions are **35.05% of gross salary**, split between employee (withheld from gross) and employer (paid on top of gross). Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries; Eurofast Tax Card 2025.

### Contribution rate table (2025 and 2026) [T1]

| Contribution class | Employee | Employer | Combined | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension & Disability Insurance (PIO) | 14.00% | 10.00% | 24.00% | Gross (floor/ceiling apply) | PwC; Eurofast |
| Health Insurance (zdravstveno) | 5.15% | 5.15% | 10.30% | Gross (floor/ceiling apply) | PwC; Eurofast |
| Unemployment Insurance (osiguranje za slucaj nezaposlenosti) | 0.75% | 0.00% | 0.75% | Gross (employee-only; employer abolished 2019) | PwC; Eurofast |
| **TOTAL** | **19.90%** | **15.15%** | **35.05%** | Gross | PwC; Eurofast |

**Arithmetic check:** Employee column 14.00 + 5.15 + 0.75 = **19.90%**. Employer column 10.00 + 5.15 + 0.00 = **15.15%**. Combined column 24.00 + 10.30 + 0.75 = **35.05%**. Each component row sums across to its combined value (e.g. 14.00 + 10.00 = 24.00). [T1]

> There is **no employer unemployment contribution** -- it was abolished in 2019. Source: PwC; Eurofast.

### Contribution base floor and ceiling [T1]

Social contributions (all three classes) are computed on a base that is bounded by a monthly **floor** and **ceiling**. The salary tax (Section 2) is NOT subject to these bounds.

| Item | 2025 value | 2026 value | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly contribution base (floor) | RSD 45,950 (35% of avg monthly salary) | RSD 51,297 | Orbitax; Eurofast; Mondaq / Zunic Law; DMK |
| Maximum monthly contribution base (ceiling) | RSD 656,425 (5× avg monthly salary) | RSD 732,820 | Orbitax; Eurofast / Eurofast; TaxRavens |
| Maximum annual contribution base | RSD 7,877,100 (= 656,425 × 12) | [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm 2026 annual max] | Orbitax (2025) |

**Arithmetic check:** ceiling RSD 656,425 ≥ floor RSD 45,950 (2025) and 732,820 ≥ 51,297 (2026). Annual max 656,425 × 12 = **7,877,100**. [T1]

### How floor/ceiling apply [T1]

```
Contribution base = MIN( MAX( gross salary, floor ), ceiling )
Employee contributions = Contribution base × 19.90%
Employer contributions = Contribution base × 15.15%
```

- If gross < floor (e.g. part-time), contributions are still computed on the **floor**.
- If gross > ceiling, contributions are capped at the **ceiling**.
- Pro-rate the floor for partial months of employment (conservative default). Source: conservative default — exact pro-ration method `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`.

---

## Section 4 -- Gross-to-Net Computation Order

The deterministic order of operations for a standard monthly payroll: [T1]

```
1.  Determine gross salary (bruto).
2.  Contribution base = MIN( MAX(gross, floor), ceiling ).
3.  Employee contributions = Contribution base × 19.90%   (withheld from gross).
4.  Salary tax base = MAX(gross − monthly non-taxable amount, 0).
5.  Salary tax = Salary tax base × 10%                     (withheld from gross).
6.  Net pay (neto) = gross − employee contributions − salary tax.
7.  Employer contributions = Contribution base × 15.15%    (paid on top of gross).
8.  Total employer cost = gross + employer contributions   (= gross × 1.1515 when gross is within floor/ceiling).
```

Source: Eurofast Tax Card 2025 (withholding mechanics); employer cost multiplier 1.1515 per Eurofast.

> **Conservative default:** treat total employer cash cost as `gross × 1.1515` only when gross sits between the floor and ceiling. When gross is below the floor or above the ceiling, compute employer contributions on the bounded base instead.

---

## Section 5 -- Conservative Defaults

When a fact is unknown, apply these defaults and flag for the reviewer. Source: research `conservative_defaults`.

| # | Default assumption |
|---|---|
| CD1 | Use the 2025 monthly non-taxable salary amount RSD 28,423 for any payroll dated Feb 2025 -- Jan 2026; switch to RSD 34,221 for the 2026 cycle. |
| CD2 | Apply minimum contribution base RSD 45,950 and maximum RSD 656,425 for all 2025 monthly payrolls; pro-rate the floor for partial months. |
| CD3 | Treat total employer cost as gross × 1.1515 (employer contributions on top of gross) when gross is within the floor/ceiling band. |
| CD4 | Assume the unemployment contribution is employee-only (0.75%); the employer pays no unemployment contribution. |
| CD5 | Assume the employee is a standard resident employee with no special incentive/relief unless told otherwise (new-employee reliefs extended to 31 Dec 2026 — see Section 12). Source: KPMG RS tax alert (Dec 2025). |

---

## Section 6 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs before computing any payroll [T1]

Ask for any unknown item. Do **not** compute until items 1--5 are confirmed.

1. **Employer PIB** (Poreski identifikacioni broj — 9-digit tax ID) and APR company registration. Source: Playroll.
2. **Pay period and payment date** (the PPP-PD is filed at/before each salary payment — Section 8).
3. **Gross salary (bruto) for the period**, in RSD. If only a net figure is known, flag CD-net (gross-up required).
4. **Employee CROSO registration status** (registered via the M Form before commencement of work). Source: Playroll.
5. **Whether any contribution/tax relief or incentive applies** (e.g. new-employee relief; young/disabled/returnee incentives) [T2].
6. Employee age and number of dependents (only relevant to the supplementary annual PIT — Section 9) [T2].

### Refusal Catalogue [T1]

Refuse to produce a final payroll figure and escalate when:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Gross salary not provided (only "net" or "budget") | Flag CD-net; gross-up requires iterative computation — present as estimate only and flag for reviewer [T2]. |
| Employee not registered in CROSO (no M Form) | STOP. Registration must precede employment. Do not compute payroll. Source: Playroll. |
| Payment date / pay period unknown | STOP. PPP-PD timing and the applicable non-taxable amount depend on the date. |
| A relief/incentive is claimed but not documented | Flag [T2]. Do not apply relief without confirming eligibility and the governing rulebook. |
| Income is not employment income (dividends, royalties, rent, capital gains, self-employment) | OUT OF SCOPE for this skill. Escalate to the relevant Serbia skill / adviser [T3]. |
| Supplementary annual PIT base or ordering is ambiguous | Flag [T2] — see Section 9 research-gap note. |

---

## Section 7 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library (Deterministic)

Map bank-statement narrations (typically in Serbian) to payroll classifications. All patterns [T1] unless flagged.

### 7a. Salary credits to the employee's account

| Narration pattern (Serbian / common) | Classification |
|---|---|
| ZARADA, ISPLATA ZARADE, PLATA, NETO ZARADA | Net salary payment (neto) |
| AKONTACIJA ZARADE | Salary advance (akontacija) — partial net payment |
| ZARADA [month/year], MESECNA ZARADA | Net monthly salary |
| NAKNADA ZARADE (bolovanje) | Salary compensation during sick leave [T2] — confirm payer (employer vs RFZO) |
| REGRES, REGRES ZA GODISNJI ODMOR | Holiday allowance (taxable as part of salary) [T2] |

### 7b. Statutory non-taxable employee benefits (reimbursements)

| Narration pattern | Classification | Non-taxable cap (2025) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| DNEVNICA, DNEVNICE (domace) | Domestic per diem | up to RSD 3,380/day | research payroll_items |
| PREVOZ, NAKNADA ZA PREVOZ | Commuting / public transport reimbursement | up to RSD 5,630/month | research payroll_items |

| JUBILARNA NAGRADA | Anniversary (jubilee) award | RSD 28,152 | research payroll_items |

> Amounts paid **above** these caps are taxable as salary and bear contributions [T2]. The caps above are for the 2025 cycle; re-index for 2026 `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm 2026 benefit caps]`.

### 7c. Employer remittances (debits from the company account)

| Narration pattern | Classification |
|---|---|
| POREZ NA ZARADE, PURS POREZ | Salary tax remittance to PURS |
| DOPRINOSI PIO / DOPRINOS ZA PENZIJSKO | Pension (PIO) contributions remittance |
| DOPRINOSI ZDRAVSTVO / RFZO | Health contributions remittance |
| DOPRINOS NEZAPOSLENOST | Unemployment contribution remittance (employee 0.75% only) |
| PPP-PD, OBJEDINJENA NAPLATA | Consolidated PPP-PD payment (tax + all contributions) |

> Salaries, contributions and salary tax are **never** items on a VAT (PDV) return — keep them out of serbia-vat. Source: serbia-vat.md Step 1a.

## Section 8 -- Filing Obligations

### Forms [T1]

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Portal | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PPP-PD** | Consolidated individual electronic tax return for withheld salary tax + all social contributions; lists every employee per income payment | Filed on or before the day salary is paid; tax and contributions due no later than the salary payment date | ePorezi (qualified e-certificate required) | PURS; TaxAdvisorSerbia; Playroll |
| **PP-GPDG** | Supplementary annual personal income tax return for high earners (annual income above 3× average annual salary) | 15 May of the year following the income year (e.g. 15 May 2025 for 2024 income); pre-filled by PURS | ePorezi | PwC; Eurofast; Forvis Mazars; KPMG |
| **M Form (CROSO)** | Registration of an employee into compulsory social insurance via the Central Registry | Before the employee starts work | CROSO (croso.gov.rs) | Playroll |

> **PPP-PD timing caveat:** the PPP-PD is filed at/before each salary payment with tax due on payment. The commonly-cited "15th of the following month" relates more to certain other obligations. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact PPP-PD timing against current PURS guidance.]` Source: research caveat (5).

### Employer setup sequence [T1]

1. Register the business with **APR** (Serbian Business Registers Agency).
2. Obtain a tax ID (**PIB**) from PURS.
3. Register each employee into compulsory social insurance via **CROSO** using the **M Form** before commencement of work.

Source: Playroll.

## Section 9 -- Supplementary Annual Personal Income Tax (Godisnji porez)

A supplementary **annual** personal income tax applies **only** to individuals whose total annual income exceeds **3× the average annual salary**. It is separate from the monthly 10% salary tax and is reconciled via the pre-filled PP-GPDG. Source: PwC; Eurofast; Forvis Mazars; KPMG.

### Average annual salary (income year 2024) [T1]

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Average **annual** salary (2024) | RSD 1,624,836 (published by the Republic Statistical Office, 26 Feb 2025) | Forvis Mazars |
| 3× average annual salary (filing threshold) | RSD 4,874,508 | PwC; Eurofast |
| 6× average annual salary (top-band threshold) | RSD 9,749,016 | PwC; Eurofast |

> 2026 annual PIT thresholds (based on the 2025 average salary) will be published in early 2027. `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm 2025-income-year thresholds when published.]` Source: research caveat (4).

### Annual PIT bands (2024 income) [T1]

| Band | Annual income range (2024) | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Up to 3× avg = RSD 4,874,508 | 0% (exempt) | PwC; Eurofast |
| 2 | 3×--6× avg = RSD 4,874,508 -- 9,749,016 | 10% | PwC; Eurofast |
| 3 | Above 6× avg = above RSD 9,749,016 | 15% | PwC; Eurofast |

### Annual PIT allowances (2024 income) [T1]

| Allowance | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Personal allowance | 40% of avg annual salary = RSD 649,934 (= 1,624,836 × 40%) | Eurofast Tax Card 2025; Forvis Mazars |
| Per dependent | 15% of avg annual salary = RSD 243,725 each (= 1,624,836 × 15%) | Eurofast; Forvis Mazars |
| Total allowances cap | 50% of taxable income | Eurofast; Forvis Mazars |
| Young taxpayer relief (under 40 on 31 Dec of tax year) | Additional deduction of 3× avg annual salary (RSD 4,874,508) on employment / self-employment / author income | PwC; Eurofast |

**Arithmetic check:** 1,624,836 × 40% = 649,934.40 → RSD 649,934. 1,624,836 × 15% = 243,725.40 → RSD 243,725. [T1]

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the precise ordering of the annual PIT computation — specifically whether the 0/10/15% bands apply to total annual income before or after deducting the personal/dependent allowances and the young-taxpayer relief. The worked example below applies the bands to income **after** allowances (the conventional Serbian mechanic) and flags this as [T2].

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All figures in RSD. Each example is recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Standard salary, RSD 100,000 gross, 2025 cycle [T1]

- Gross = 100,000. Within floor (45,950) and ceiling (656,425) → contribution base = 100,000.
- Employee contributions = 100,000 × 19.90% = **19,900.00**
- Salary tax base = 100,000 − 28,423 = 71,577; salary tax = 71,577 × 10% = **7,157.70**
- **Net pay = 100,000 − 19,900.00 − 7,157.70 = 72,942.30**
- Employer contributions = 100,000 × 15.15% = **15,150.00**
- **Total employer cost = 100,000 + 15,150.00 = 115,150.00** (= 100,000 × 1.1515) ✓

Bank statement: a credit of RSD 72,942.30 narrated `ZARADA 03/2025`.

### Example 2 -- Mid salary, RSD 200,000 gross, 2025 cycle [T1]

- Contribution base = 200,000 (within bounds).
- Employee contributions = 200,000 × 19.90% = **39,800.00**
- Salary tax base = 200,000 − 28,423 = 171,577; salary tax = 171,577 × 10% = **17,157.70**
- **Net pay = 200,000 − 39,800.00 − 17,157.70 = 143,042.30**
- Employer contributions = 200,000 × 15.15% = **30,300.00**
- **Total employer cost = 230,300.00**

### Example 3 -- Below the contribution floor, RSD 40,000 gross (part-time), 2025 [T1]

- Gross 40,000 < floor 45,950 → **contribution base = 45,950** (the floor).
- Employee contributions = 45,950 × 19.90% = **9,144.05**
- Salary tax base uses **actual gross**: 40,000 − 28,423 = 11,577; salary tax = 11,577 × 10% = **1,157.70**
- **Net pay = 40,000 − 9,144.05 − 1,157.70 = 29,698.25**
- Employer contributions = 45,950 × 15.15% = **6,961.43** (6,961.4250 rounded)
- **Total employer cost = 40,000 + 6,961.43 = 46,961.43**

> Note: contributions are on the floor (45,950) while salary tax is on actual gross (40,000). The two bases differ by design [T1]. Net pay can therefore fall faster than gross for sub-floor wages.

### Example 4 -- Above the contribution ceiling, RSD 800,000 gross, 2025 [T1]

- Gross 800,000 > ceiling 656,425 → **contribution base = 656,425** (the ceiling).
- Employee contributions = 656,425 × 19.90% = **130,628.58** (130,628.5750 rounded)
- Salary tax base = 800,000 − 28,423 = 771,577; salary tax = 771,577 × 10% = **77,157.70**
- **Net pay = 800,000 − 130,628.58 − 77,157.70 = 592,213.72**
- Employer contributions = 656,425 × 15.15% = **99,448.39** (99,448.3875 rounded)
- **Total employer cost = 800,000 + 99,448.39 = 899,448.39**

> Salary tax has no ceiling — it is 10% of (full gross − non-taxable amount). Only contributions are capped. [T1]

### Example 5 -- 2026 cycle, RSD 120,000 gross [T1]

Uses 2026 parameters: non-taxable RSD 34,221; floor RSD 51,297; ceiling RSD 732,820.

- Contribution base = 120,000 (within bounds).
- Employee contributions = 120,000 × 19.90% = **23,880.00**
- Salary tax base = 120,000 − 34,221 = 85,779; salary tax = 85,779 × 10% = **8,577.90**
- **Net pay = 120,000 − 23,880.00 − 8,577.90 = 87,542.10**
- Employer contributions = 120,000 × 15.15% = **18,180.00**
- **Total employer cost = 138,180.00**

### Example 6 -- Supplementary annual PIT, 2024 income RSD 11,000,000, over 40, 1 dependent [T2]

- Income 11,000,000 > 3× threshold (4,874,508) → annual PIT applies. Source: PwC.
- Personal allowance = 649,934; dependent allowance = 243,725; total allowances = 893,659.
- Allowance cap = 50% × 11,000,000 = 5,500,000; 893,659 < cap → full allowances used. [T1]
- Taxable base (income after allowances) = 11,000,000 − 893,659 = 10,106,341.
- Apply bands to the taxable base:
  - Band 1 (0–4,874,508): 0% → 0
  - Band 2 (4,874,508–9,749,016): (9,749,016 − 4,874,508) × 10% = 4,874,508 × 10% = **487,450.80**
  - Band 3 (above 9,749,016): (10,106,341 − 9,749,016) × 15% = 357,325 × 15% = **53,598.75**
- **Annual PIT ≈ 487,450.80 + 53,598.75 = 541,049.55**

> **[T2] / [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the base ordering (bands on income before vs after allowances) per the Section 9 note. This example applies bands after allowances. The monthly 10% salary tax already paid is separate and is not netted here — confirm interaction with the adviser. Source: research caveat (3)/(4).

## Section 11 -- Minimum Wage

The minimum wage in Serbia is set as a **net amount per working hour**, so the monthly minimum varies with the number of working hours in the month. Source: TSG.rs; NNRoad; RS Partners.

| Period | Net minimum wage per working hour | Indicative monthly (at 174 h) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 Jan -- 30 Sep 2025 | RSD 308/hour (net) | ≈ RSD 53,592 (illustrative, not statutory) | TSG.rs |
| From 1 Oct 2025 | RSD 337/hour (net) — extraordinary 9.4% increase | varies with hours | TSG.rs |
| January 2026 increase | Announced | `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact 2026 rate]` | research caveat (2) |

> The ~RSD 53,592 monthly figure is **illustrative only** (308 × 174 = 53,592); the statutory rate is the per-hour net amount, and monthly pay depends on actual working hours. Source: research caveat (2).

## Section 16 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the engagement is mid-year or records are incomplete:

1. **No prior PPP-PD filings on hand** → request the ePorezi PPP-PD history; reconcile each month's tax + contributions against bank remittances. Do not assume prior months were correct.
2. **Net-only history** → reconstruct gross via the gross-to-net order (Section 4), iterating; mark all reconstructed grosses as estimates [T2].
3. **Unknown which non-taxable amount applied** → key off the **payment date** of each run (RSD 28,423 for Feb 2025–Jan 2026; RSD 34,221 for 2026).
4. **Employee CROSO status unknown** → STOP and confirm registration (M Form) before processing; an unregistered employee cannot be lawfully run on payroll. Source: Playroll.
5. **Relief/incentive history unclear** → default to no relief (CD5), flag [T2], and ask the adviser to confirm eligibility.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute payroll for an employee not registered in CROSO (M Form) — registration must precede employment.
- NEVER apply the contribution floor/ceiling to the salary tax — the non-taxable amount applies to actual gross; only contributions are bounded.
- NEVER charge an employer unemployment contribution — it was abolished in 2019; employer total is 15.15%, not 15.90%.
- NEVER cap the salary tax — only contributions are capped at the ceiling.
- NEVER use the wrong cycle's non-taxable amount — RSD 28,423 for Feb 2025–Jan 2026, RSD 34,221 for 2026; key off the payment date.
- NEVER put salaries, salary tax, or contributions on a VAT (PDV) return — they are out of scope for serbia-vat.
- NEVER apply a relief/incentive without confirming eligibility and the governing rulebook (flag [T2]).
- NEVER treat the illustrative monthly minimum wage (~RSD 53,592) as statutory — the statutory rate is per net working hour.
- NEVER miss the PPP-PD timing — it is filed at/before each salary payment with tax due on the payment date.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a qualified Serbian tax adviser.
- NEVER guess any figure marked `[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]`.
