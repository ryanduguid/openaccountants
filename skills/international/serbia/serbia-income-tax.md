### Headline Income Tax Rates (2025 income year)

| Income type | Rate | Base / notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employment income (monthly withholding) | 10% flat | Gross salary minus non-taxable cap RSD 28,423/month (2025); RSD 34,221/month from 1 Jan 2026 | PwC; Eurofast; KPMG Dec 2025 |
| Self-employment / entrepreneur (actual income, bookkeeping) | 10% flat | On taxable profit | welcometoserbia.gov.rs |
| Self-employment / entrepreneur (flat-rate / paušalno) | 10% | Applied to a deemed lump-sum base set by the Tax Administration; effective tax is a fixed monthly amount; annual base growth capped at 10% through end 2027 | Poreska uprava; NALED |
| Capital gains | 15% | Resident exempt if asset held 10+ consecutive years | PwC income-determination |
| Investment income (dividends, interest, investment fund) | 15% | -- | PwC income-determination |
| Rental / real-estate income | 20% on 75% of gross (25% standard deduction), or on income after documented actual costs | -- | PwC income-determination; audere.rs |
| Royalty / copyright income | 20% | After standard cost deduction of 50%, 43% or 34% depending on royalty type | PwC income-determination |
| Other income | 20% (15% for insurance proceeds) | -- | PwC income-determination |

### Annual Supplementary Tax -- 2025 income (filed 2026)

Applies only if total net income exceeds **3x the average annual salary = RSD 5,439,096** (3 × RSD 1,813,032) (KPMG Feb 2026).

| Band | Net income (RSD) | Rate | Cumulative supplementary tax at top of band | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Below threshold | 0 -- 5,439,096 | 0% (not subject to annual tax) | RSD 0 | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Band 1 | 5,439,096 -- 10,878,192 | 10% | RSD 543,909.60 | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Band 2 | above 10,878,192 | 15% | -- | KPMG Feb 2026 |

Band 1 width = 10,878,192 − 5,439,096 = RSD 5,439,096; at 10% that is RSD 543,909.60 of tax accumulated by the top of Band 1. PwC expresses Band 2 as "10% then +15% = effective 25% on the top band"; both descriptions are the same marginal 15% supplement layered on the 10% (PwC; KPMG Feb 2026). Personal/dependent deductions and youth relief (Section 1 below and Section 5.10) reduce the base before bands apply.

### Annual Tax Deductions (2025 income)

| Deduction | Value (RSD) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Average annual salary (basis for multiples) | 1,813,032 (implied from the 3x threshold of 5,439,096) | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Taxpayer personal deduction (40% of avg annual salary) | 725,213 | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Per-dependent deduction (15% of avg annual salary) | 271,955 per dependent | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Cap on combined personal + dependent deductions | 50% of taxable income | KPMG Feb 2026 |
| Youth relief (taxpayer under 40 on last day of year) | Additional reduction of 5,439,096 (3x avg annual salary) against employment/self-employment/IP income | KPMG Feb 2026 |

### Social Security Contributions (2025)

| Contribution | Employee | Employer | Total | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension & disability (PIO) | 14% | 10% | 24% | PwC other-taxes; Orbitax |
| Health insurance | 5.15% | 5.15% | 10.3% | PwC other-taxes |
| Unemployment insurance | 0.75% | 0% (employee only) | 0.75% | PwC other-taxes; welcometoserbia.gov.rs |
| **TOTAL** | **19.90%** | **15.15%** | **35.05%** | PwC other-taxes |

Employee column check: 14% + 5.15% + 0.75% = **19.90%**. Employer column check: 10% + 5.15% + 0% = **15.15%**. Total column check: 24% + 10.3% + 0.75% = **35.05%**, and 19.90% + 15.15% = **35.05%**. Self-employed entrepreneurs and freelancers pay **both** portions themselves: PIO 24% + health 10.3% + unemployment 0.75% = 35.05% (welcometoserbia.gov.rs).

**2025 contribution base limits** (reset annually on the published average gross salary): floor **RSD 45,950/month** (35% of average salary); ceiling **RSD 656,425/month** (5x average salary; **RSD 7,877,100/year**) (Orbitax; Eurofast).

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Residency unknown | Treat as resident (worldwide income); flag for reviewer | PwC residence |
| Period spans 2025/2026 | Use RSD 28,423 non-taxable cap for 2025 periods; RSD 34,221 only from 1 Jan 2026 | Eurofast; KPMG Dec 2025 |
| Social base limits, year unknown | Use 2025 floor RSD 45,950 / ceiling RSD 656,425; reset each year | Orbitax |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of taxpayer type (employee / entrepreneur-bookkeeping / entrepreneur-flat-rate / freelancer) and residency status (resident vs non-resident).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, contribution payment records (PIO/health/unemployment), prior-year return or assessment, VAT (PDV) registration status, age (for youth relief and the under-40 annual-tax reduction), number of dependents.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure ledger (entrepreneurs on bookkeeping), flat-rate decision (rešenje) from the Tax Administration (paušalci), freelancer quarterly self-taxation filings, employer PPP-PD records (employees), provisional/installment payment confirmations.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify all income is captured, that deductions are supported by valid documentation, and that the correct regime (employment / entrepreneur / freelancer) was applied."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-RS-1 -- Taxpayer type unknown.** "Serbia taxes employment, entrepreneur, and freelancer income under different rules and rates. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the taxpayer type. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-RS-2 -- Companies / legal persons.** "This skill covers natural persons (employees, entrepreneurs, freelancers) only. Corporate income tax (porez na dobit pravnih lica) for d.o.o./a.d. companies is out of scope. Escalate to a Serbian tax adviser."

**R-RS-3 -- Non-resident / dual-resident.** "Non-resident and dual-resident taxation (Serbian-source only) and tax-treaty relief require specialised analysis. Escalate to a Serbian tax adviser."

**R-RS-4 -- Flat-rate (paušalno) base determination.** "The flat-rate monthly tax is a deemed amount set per-taxpayer by the Tax Administration based on activity, location, age and gender. This skill cannot derive that figure; obtain the official decision (rešenje). Escalate to a Serbian tax adviser." [RESEARCH GAP -- the per-taxpayer flat-rate base cannot be reduced to a single national figure; reviewer to confirm from the rešenje.]

**R-RS-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to Tax Administration enforcement. Late-payment interest runs at the NBS reference rate + 10 percentage points and repeat violations can trigger an activity ban of 6 months to 3 years. Do not advise. Escalate to a Serbian tax adviser immediately."

**R-RS-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Serbian VAT (PDV), use the serbia-vat-return skill (if available) or escalate."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. Serbian descriptions are often in Cyrillic or Latin script; match Latin transliterations. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Employment salary (2025 monthly withholding)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; INTESA UPLATA ; POSLODAVAC D.O.O. ; ZARADA FEB 2025 ; +107,992.30 ; RSD`

**Reasoning:**
Net salary received. Gross salary is RSD 150,000/month. 2025 non-taxable cap = RSD 28,423 (Eurofast; KPMG Dec 2025).
- PIT base = 150,000 − 28,423 = 121,577. PIT = 121,577 × 10% = **RSD 12,157.70**.
- Gross 150,000 is between floor 45,950 and ceiling 656,425, so contributions apply on full gross. Employee contributions = 150,000 × 19.90% = **RSD 29,850.00**.
- Net = 150,000 − 12,157.70 − 29,850.00 = **RSD 107,992.30**.

Check: 12,157.70 + 29,850.00 = 42,007.70; 150,000 − 42,007.70 = 107,992.30 ✓

**Classification:** Employment income, already taxed at source via PPP-PD. Net pay RSD 107,992.30. Do not re-tax.

### Example 2 -- Entrepreneur on bookkeeping (actual income, 10%)

**Input:** Sole entrepreneur, VAT-registered. Annual taxable profit (revenue net of PDV, less allowable expenses) = RSD 2,400,000.

**Reasoning:**
- Income tax = 2,400,000 × 10% = **RSD 240,000** (welcometoserbia.gov.rs).
- Entrepreneur pays full combined contributions on the contribution base (here using profit as the base, subject to the 2025 floor/ceiling): PIO 24% + health 10.3% + unemployment 0.75% = 35.05%. On RSD 2,400,000 = **RSD 841,200** (welcometoserbia.gov.rs). [RESEARCH GAP -- the precise contribution base for bookkeeping entrepreneurs (taxable profit vs an elected base, with floor/ceiling) should be confirmed by the reviewer.]

**Classification:** Income tax RSD 240,000; contributions ~RSD 841,200 (subject to base-determination check).

### Example 3 -- Freelancer self-taxation, Model A (quarterly)

**Input line (one quarter, income from abroad):**
`30/06/2025 ; WISE PAYOUT ; UPWORK ESCROW ; Q2 FREELANCE ; +600,000.00 ; RSD`

**Reasoning (Model A):** standardized quarterly deduction RSD 96,000; 20% tax on the excess; PIO 24% and health 10.3% on the same taxable base (Eurofast; frilenseri.purs.gov.rs).
- Taxable base = 600,000 − 96,000 = 504,000.
- Tax = 504,000 × 20% = **RSD 100,800**.
- PIO = 504,000 × 24% = **RSD 120,960**; health = 504,000 × 10.3% = **RSD 51,912**.
- Total Model A burden = 100,800 + 120,960 + 51,912 = **RSD 273,672**.

**Classification:** File the freelancer self-taxation return for Q2. (See Example 4 for the Model B comparison before choosing.)

### Example 4 -- Freelancer self-taxation, Model B (same quarter)

**Reasoning (Model B):** standardized quarterly deduction RSD 57,900 **plus** 34% of gross quarterly income; 10% tax; PIO 24% (minimum payment applies) and health 10.3% (Eurofast; frilenseri.purs.gov.rs).
- Deduction = 57,900 + (600,000 × 34%) = 57,900 + 204,000 = 261,900.
- Taxable base = 600,000 − 261,900 = 338,100.
- Tax = 338,100 × 10% = **RSD 33,810**.
- PIO = 338,100 × 24% = **RSD 81,144** (subject to a minimum-contribution floor); health = 338,100 × 10.3% = **RSD 34,824.30**.
- Total Model B burden (before any PIO minimum top-up) = 33,810 + 81,144 + 34,824.30 = **RSD 149,778.30**.

**Comparison:** For this quarter Model B (RSD 149,778.30) is cheaper than Model A (RSD 273,672), driven by the 34%-of-gross deduction. Default is to present the lower-tax model and flag for reviewer; Model B's PIO minimum-payment rule may raise the result. [RESEARCH GAP -- the Model B minimum PIO contribution amount is not in the research data; reviewer to confirm on frilenseri.purs.gov.rs.]

### Example 5 -- Rental income (real estate)

**Input line:**
`10/04/2025 ; OTP UPLATA ; ZAKUPAC ; ZAKUP STAN APR ; +80,000.00 ; RSD`

**Reasoning:** Rental income taxed at 20% on 75% of gross after the 25% standard deduction, unless documented actual costs are higher (PwC income-determination; audere.rs).
- Taxable = 80,000 × 75% = 60,000.
- Tax = 60,000 × 20% = **RSD 12,000**. Effective rate = 12,000 / 80,000 = 15%.

**Classification:** Rental income, RSD 12,000 tax for the month (standard-deduction basis).

### Example 6 -- Annual supplementary tax (2025 income, high earner)

**Input:** Resident, total net income for 2025 = RSD 12,000,000. Taxpayer is 45 (no youth relief). Claims only the personal deduction. No dependents.

**Reasoning (KPMG Feb 2026):**
- Threshold = RSD 5,439,096 (3x avg annual salary). Income exceeds it, so the annual tax applies.
- Personal deduction RSD 725,213 (cannot exceed 50% of taxable income; 725,213 < 6,000,000, so allowed in full). Taxable income for the annual tax = 12,000,000 − 725,213 = 11,274,787.
- Band 1 (5,439,096 → 10,878,192): width 5,439,096 × 10% = **RSD 543,909.60**.
- Band 2 (above 10,878,192): 11,274,787 − 10,878,192 = 396,595 × 15% = **RSD 59,489.25**.
- Annual supplementary tax = 543,909.60 + 59,489.25 = **RSD 603,398.85**.

Check: 543,909.60 + 59,489.25 = 603,398.85 ✓

**Classification:** File Form PP GPDG by 15 May 2026; supplementary tax due RSD 603,398.85 (in addition to tax already withheld during the year).

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency

Resident individuals are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents on Serbian-source income only (PwC residence). Default to resident and flag if uncertain.

### 5.2 Employment Income -- 10% Flat

10% flat PIT on gross salary minus the monthly non-taxable cap: **RSD 28,423 for 2025**, rising to **RSD 34,221 from 1 Jan 2026** (CPI-indexed each 1 February) (PwC; Eurofast; KPMG Dec 2025). Withheld monthly at source by the employer and reported on PPP-PD with each salary payment.

### 5.3 Social Security Contributions

Split: employee **19.90%** (PIO 14% + health 5.15% + unemployment 0.75%) and employer **15.15%** (PIO 10% + health 5.15%; no employer unemployment). Combined **35.05%** of gross (PwC other-taxes). 2025 base limits: floor **RSD 45,950/month**, ceiling **RSD 656,425/month** (RSD 7,877,100/year) (Orbitax; Eurofast). Self-employed/entrepreneurs and freelancers pay the full 35.05% themselves (welcometoserbia.gov.rs).

### 5.4 Entrepreneur Income Tax -- 10%

10% on either actual taxable profit (bookkeeping) or a deemed flat-rate (paušalno) base set by the Tax Administration. Flat-rate base annual growth is capped at 10% through end 2027 (Poreska uprava; NALED). Default to bookkeeping unless flat-rate is elected and the client qualifies.

### 5.5 Flat-Rate (Paušalac) Eligibility

Annual turnover must not exceed **RSD 6,000,000** (calendar year) and must not exceed **RSD 8,000,000** over a rolling 365 days; the entrepreneur cannot be VAT-registered (pausal.rs; NALED). The actual monthly tax is a per-taxpayer deemed amount -- see R-RS-4.

### 5.6 Freelancer Self-Taxation (copyright / income from abroad) -- quarterly

Two models (Eurofast; frilenseri.purs.gov.rs):
- **Model A:** standardized deduction RSD 96,000/quarter (RSD 32,000/month); 20% tax on the excess; PIO 24% and health 10.3% on the same base.
- **Model B:** standardized deduction RSD 57,900/quarter plus 34% of gross quarterly income; 10% tax; PIO 24% (minimum payment applies) and health 10.3%.

Band 2: 15% on income above 6x (10,878,192) (KPMG Feb 2026). Personal deduction RSD 725,213 and per-dependent deduction RSD 271,955 (combined deductions capped at 50% of taxable income). Youth relief: taxpayers under 40 on the last day of the year get an additional RSD 5,439,096 reduction against employment/self-employment/IP income (KPMG Feb 2026).

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Choosing Freelancer Model A vs Model B

- Model B's 34%-of-gross deduction favours higher-revenue quarters; Model A's flat RSD 96,000 favours lower-revenue quarters.
- Model B carries a minimum PIO contribution; verify the current-quarter minimum before concluding which model is cheaper.
- **Conservative default:** compute both, present the lower total, flag for reviewer. Re-verify standardized amounts on frilenseri.purs.gov.rs before filing.

### 6.2 Entrepreneur Contribution Base

- The contribution base for bookkeeping entrepreneurs interacts with the floor (RSD 45,950) and ceiling (RSD 656,425).
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm whether contributions are on taxable profit or an elected base, and whether the annual ceiling (RSD 7,877,100) applies.

### 6.3 Flat-Rate vs Bookkeeping Election

- Flat-rate is unavailable if VAT-registered or turnover exceeds RSD 6,000,000.
- The deemed monthly tax comes from the Tax Administration decision (rešenje), not from a formula.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm eligibility and obtain the rešenje.

### 6.4 Home Office / Mixed-Use Apportionment

- Only the business-use portion of electricity, water, internet and phone is deductible (entrepreneurs on bookkeeping).
- **Conservative default:** 0% until a documented basis is provided.

### 6.5 Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, maintenance and depreciation is deductible; requires a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until a mileage log is provided.

### 6.6 Royalty Cost-Deduction Class

- Standard cost deduction is 50%, 43% or 34% depending on the royalty type.
- **Conservative default:** lowest deduction (34%) until type confirmed.

### 6.7 Capital-Asset Holding Period (capital gains)

- 10+ consecutive years of holding gives a resident exemption.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm acquisition date and continuous holding.

### 6.8 Annual-Tax Deduction Cap and Youth Relief

- Combined personal + dependent deductions are capped at 50% of taxable income.
- Youth relief requires the taxpayer to be under 40 on the last day of the year.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Employment net pay (2025).**
Input: Gross salary RSD 150,000/month, single employee, 2025.
Expected: PIT base = 121,577; PIT = RSD 12,157.70; employee contributions = RSD 29,850.00; net = RSD 107,992.30.

**Test 2 -- Entrepreneur bookkeeping tax.**
Input: Taxable profit RSD 2,400,000.
Expected: Income tax = RSD 240,000 (10%). Contributions ~RSD 841,200 at 35.05% (subject to base check).

**Test 3 -- Freelancer Model A (one quarter).**
Input: Gross quarterly income RSD 600,000.
Expected: Base = 504,000; tax = RSD 100,800 (20%); PIO = RSD 120,960 (24%); health = RSD 51,912 (10.3%); total = RSD 273,672.

**Test 4 -- Freelancer Model B (same quarter).**
Input: Gross quarterly income RSD 600,000.
Expected: Deduction = 261,900; base = 338,100; tax = RSD 33,810 (10%); PIO = RSD 81,144 (before min); health = RSD 34,824.30; total = RSD 149,778.30 (before any PIO minimum top-up). Model B is cheaper than Model A here.

**Test 5 -- Rental income.**
Input: Monthly rent RSD 80,000, standard deduction.
Expected: Taxable 60,000 (75%); tax = RSD 12,000 (20%); effective 15%.

**Test 6 -- Annual supplementary tax (2025).**
Input: Total net income RSD 12,000,000; age 45; personal deduction only; no dependents.
Expected: Taxable base = 11,274,787; Band 1 = RSD 543,909.60; Band 2 = RSD 59,489.25; annual tax = RSD 603,398.85.

**Test 7 -- Below annual-tax threshold.**
Input: Total net income RSD 5,000,000.
Expected: Below RSD 5,439,096 threshold -- no annual supplementary tax; PP GPDG not required on this basis.

**Test 8 -- Flat-rate ineligible (turnover).**
Input: Entrepreneur turnover RSD 7,000,000/year.
Expected: Exceeds RSD 6,000,000 -- flat-rate unavailable; bookkeeping at 10% applies; also approaching the RSD 8,000,000 VAT threshold.

- NEVER invent the flat-rate (paušalno) monthly amount -- it comes from the Tax Administration rešenje
- NEVER tax employment income twice -- salary received net is already withheld via PPP-PD
- NEVER omit the Model B minimum PIO contribution check before declaring it the cheaper model
- NEVER include collected PDV (VAT) in business income for VAT-registered entrepreneurs
- NEVER apply contributions above the ceiling (RSD 656,425/month; RSD 7,877,100/year for 2025)
- NEVER allow income tax, fines, or personal expenses as deductions
- NEVER ignore the 50% cap on combined personal + dependent annual-tax deductions
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated and pending reviewer sign-off
