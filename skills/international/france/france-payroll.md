## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (Prélèvement à la Source)

Since 1 January 2019, France operates a PAYE system where the employer withholds income tax from the employee's **net imposable** (net taxable salary) each month.

### How PAS Works

| Step | Detail |
|---|---|
| Rate source | DGFiP transmits the employee's personalised PAS rate to the employer via the DSN feedback loop |
| Default rate | If no personalised rate is available, a statutory "taux neutre" (barème par défaut) applies, based on monthly net imposable |
| Calculation | PAS = Net imposable x PAS rate |
| Deducted from | Net salary (after social contributions, before payment) |
| Remittance | Monthly via DSN + URSSAF collection |

### Income Tax Brackets (2026, progressive scale for annual declaration)

| Taxable Income (EUR, per part) | Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 -- 11,497 | 0% |
| 11,498 -- 29,315 | 11% |
| 29,316 -- 83,823 | 30% |
| 83,824 -- 180,294 | 41% |
| 180,295+ | 45% |

The PAS rate already accounts for the quotient familial (family coefficient) system when personalised. The employer does NOT compute tax brackets -- they simply apply the rate received from DGFiP.

### Taux Neutre (Default Rate Grid, 2026 -- Metropolitan France)

Used when no personalised rate is available. Based on monthly net imposable. Progressive grid from 0% (low income) to 43% (high income). Consult the CGI Article 204 H barème for exact thresholds.

## Section 3 -- Social Security -- Employee Deductions (2026)

### URSSAF Contributions (Employee Share)

| Contribution | Employee Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Maladie, maternité, invalidité, décès | 0% | Total gross |
| Vieillesse plafonnée (old-age, capped) | 6.90% | Up to 1 PMSS (EUR 4,005/month) |
| Vieillesse déplafonnée (old-age, uncapped) | 0.40% | Total gross |
| CSG déductible | 6.80% | 98.25% of gross |
| CSG non-déductible | 2.40% | 98.25% of gross |
| CRDS | 0.50% | 98.25% of gross |

Note: The 98.25% abattement (1.75% deduction for professional expenses) applies only up to 4 PMSS (EUR 192,240/year in 2026). Above that threshold, CSG/CRDS apply on 100% of gross.

### AGIRC-ARRCO (Supplementary Pension -- Employee Share)

| Contribution | Employee Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Retraite complémentaire Tranche 1 (T1) | 3.15% | Up to 1 PMSS |
| Retraite complémentaire Tranche 2 (T2) | 8.64% | From 1 to 8 PMSS (EUR 4,005 -- EUR 32,040) |
| CEG (Contribution d'Équilibre Général) T1 | 0.86% | Up to 1 PMSS |
| CEG T2 | 1.08% | From 1 to 8 PMSS |
| CET (Contribution d'Équilibre Technique) | 0.14% | From 1 to 8 PMSS (cadres/non-cadres above PMSS) |

AGIRC-ARRCO rates shown are **appelés** (call rates = 127% of contractual rates). Pension points are calculated on the contractual rate (e.g., T1 contractual = 6.20% total).

### Chômage (Unemployment -- Employee Share)

| Contribution | Employee Rate | Base |
|---|---|---|
| Assurance chômage | 0% | Up to 4 PMSS |

Employee unemployment contribution was abolished in October 2018. Only the employer pays.

### Total Employee Deductions (Approximate)

For a salary at the PMSS (EUR 4,005/month): employee social contributions total approximately **21--23%** of gross, plus PAS income tax.

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (cotisations + PAS) | **This skill (france-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed income tax | france-income-tax.md |
| Auto-entrepreneur / micro-enterprise | france-micro-enterprise.md |
| TVA (French VAT) | france-vat-return.md |
| Bookkeeping | france-bookkeeping.md |
| E-invoicing (Factur-X / Chorus Pro) | france-einvoice.md |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages + employer charges are P&L expenses. Employee deductions (cotisations + PAS) are liabilities (comptes 43x) until DSN payment. Employer cotisations are booked to 645xxx.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** The PAS system means employees' income tax is largely settled in real time. Year-end déclaration may result in adjustments. The net imposable on the bulletin de paie is the reference figure.
- **Payroll → DSN:** All payroll data feeds directly into DSN. Accurate bulletins de paie = accurate DSN. Errors in DSN trigger anomaly reports from net-entreprises.fr.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER compute income tax brackets manually for withholding -- use the PAS rate provided by DGFiP
- NEVER forget to apply the 98.25% abattement on gross for CSG/CRDS (and 100% above 4 PMSS)
- NEVER confuse Tranche 1 (up to 1 PMSS) and Tranche 2 (1--8 PMSS) ceilings for AGIRC-ARRCO
- NEVER omit the mutuelle obligatoire (compulsory health insurance) from employer cost calculations
- NEVER apply employee chômage contributions -- they were abolished in 2018
- NEVER issue a bulletin de paie missing any mandatory field under Code du Travail
- NEVER miss a DSN deadline -- penalties of EUR 7.50 per employee per month of delay
- NEVER forget that SMIC changed mid-year (1 June 2026) -- verify which rate applies
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- direct to expert-comptable for sign-off
