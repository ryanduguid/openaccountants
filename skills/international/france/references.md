## OpenFisca France

- Repository: [openfisca/openfisca-france](https://github.com/openfisca/openfisca-france)
- License: AGPL-3.0
- Language: French
- Stars: 296
- Scope: Complete model of the French tax and benefit system — income tax, social contributions, housing benefits, family benefits, and more. Encodes French fiscal law as executable Python code with a web API.
- Why it matters: This is the gold standard for rules-as-code in France. Maintained by a dedicated organisation, used by French government services, and covers far more than just income tax.
- Integration: Same license (AGPL-3.0). Content, formulas, parameter values, and test cases can be directly referenced or adapted with attribution.

## Calculette Impôts (DGFiP source code)

- Repository: [GouvernementFR/calculette-impots-m-source-code](https://github.com/GouvernementFR/calculette-impots-m-source-code)
- License: CeCILL 2.1 (GPL-compatible)
- Language: French (M language — DGFiP internal)
- Stars: ~58
- Scope: The actual source code used by the French tax authority (DGFiP) to compute income tax. Written in a custom "M" language.
- Why it matters: This is literally the government's own tax engine source code, published under an open license. It is the ultimate source of truth for how French income tax is actually calculated.
- Integration: CeCILL 2.1 is explicitly GPL-compatible, which flows into AGPL. Logic can be adapted with attribution.

## Calculette Impôts Python

- Repository: [openfisca/calculette-impots-python](https://github.com/openfisca/calculette-impots-python)
- License: AGPL-3.0
- Language: French / Python
- Stars: 9
- Scope: Python translation of the DGFiP M-language tax calculator.
- Why it matters: More readable than the raw M source. Useful as a bridge between the official logic and OpenAccountants skill format.
- Integration: AGPL-3.0. Directly compatible.
