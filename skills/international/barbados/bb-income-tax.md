- **Employer NIS rate discrepancy note** — The component sum of employer contributions is 13.00%. Several published sources cite the employer headline as "12.75%", which would imply 0.25% less than the sum of components shown above. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the 12.75% or 13.00% employer figure is correct under current NIS legislation.] The combined rate cited by NISSS is 24.00% (employee 11.25% + employer 12.75% = 24.00%).  _(Source: NIS Contribution Rates (official) — https://www.nis.gov.bb/contribution-rates/; KPMG Flash Alert 2024-255 — https://kpmg.com/xx/en/our-insights/gms-flash-alert/flash-alert-2024-255.html)_

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency status | STOP -- do not apply allowances or rates without confirming residency |
| Unknown age (60+ pension allowance) | Use standard allowance (BBD 25,000) |
| Unknown employment type (employed vs self-employed) | STOP -- NIS rates and payment schedule differ |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Not VAT-registered |
| Unknown whether rental is residential vs commercial | Treat as commercial (marginal rates, not flat 15%) |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of residency status (resident/non-resident), employment type (employed/self-employed/mixed), and age (for pension allowance).

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase receipts, NIS payment records (employer schedule or self-employed receipts), prior year PIT return or tax assessment, confirmation of other income sources (rental, interest, dividends).

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, payslips for the full year (employed), TAMIS prepayment confirmation receipts, employer PAYE certificates, VAT registration details if applicable.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This PIT return was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the wholly-and-exclusively test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-BB-1** — Residency status unknown. "Residency determines whether worldwide income is taxable and whether personal allowances apply. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing whether the client is resident, non-domiciled resident, or non-resident. Please confirm before proceeding."
- **R-BB-2** — Non-resident client. "Non-residents are taxed only on Barbados-source income and are not entitled to personal allowances. Withholding tax rules apply to certain non-resident income. Escalate to a licensed Barbados tax practitioner."
- **R-BB-3** — Corporate or partnership structures. "This skill covers individuals (employed and self-employed). Corporate income tax and partnership taxation require separate analysis. Escalate to a licensed practitioner."
- **R-BB-4** — Capital gains. "Barbados has no capital gains tax. If the transaction is labelled as a capital gain but may be recharacterised as income (e.g., property trading), escalate to a licensed practitioner."
- **R-BB-5** — Arrears / BRA enforcement. "Client has outstanding tax arrears, penalty notices, or is subject to BRA enforcement action. The 1%/month compounding interest charge is severe. Do not advise. Escalate to a licensed Barbados tax practitioner immediately."
- **R-BB-6** — Expat / treaty claim. "Tax treaty benefits and expat tax positions require jurisdiction-specific analysis. Out of scope. Escalate to a licensed practitioner."
- **R-BB-7** — VAT return requested. "This skill covers personal income tax and NIS contributions only. For Barbados VAT, use the barbados-vat-return skill (if available) or escalate."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Salaried Employee, Standard Allowance

**Scenario:** Single resident employee, gross salary BBD 60,000 for 2025. PAYE deducted by employer throughout the year. No other income.

**Computation:**
```
Gross salary:               BBD 60,000
Less personal allowance:   (BBD 25,000)
Taxable income:             BBD 35,000

Tax:
  BBD 35,000 × 12.5%  =    BBD  4,375

Total PIT liability:        BBD  4,375
```

**Bank statement lines might include:**
```
15/01/2025  CIBC FIRSTCARIBBEAN  PAYROLL EMPLOYER XYZ LTD  +4,850.00  BBD
15/02/2025  CIBC FIRSTCARIBBEAN  PAYROLL EMPLOYER XYZ LTD  +4,850.00  BBD
```
(Monthly net after PAYE withheld at source.)

**Classification:** Employment income. PAYE withheld by employer monthly and remitted to BRA by the 15th of the following month (BRA — https://bra.gov.bb/Popular-Topics/Employing-People/Guide-to-PAYE). If total PAYE withheld equals liability, no balance due on 30 April.

### Example 2 -- Higher-Income Employee, Two Brackets

**Scenario:** Single resident, gross salary BBD 100,000 for 2025.

**Computation:**
```
Gross salary:               BBD 100,000
Less personal allowance:   (BBD  25,000)
Taxable income:             BBD  75,000

Tax:
  BBD 50,000 × 12.5%  =    BBD  6,250
  BBD 25,000 × 28.5%  =    BBD  7,125

Total PIT liability:        BBD 13,375
```

### Example 3 -- Self-Employed, NIS + PIT

**Scenario:** Self-employed consultant, resident, single, 45 years old. Gross professional fees BBD 80,000. Allowable business expenses BBD 12,000. Tax year 2025.

**PIT computation:**
```
Gross professional income:  BBD 80,000
Less allowable expenses:   (BBD 12,000)
Net self-employment profit: BBD 68,000
Less personal allowance:   (BBD 25,000)
Taxable income:             BBD 43,000

Tax:
  BBD 43,000 × 12.5%  =    BBD  5,375

PIT liability:              BBD  5,375
```

**NIS computation (self-employed, 2025 rates):**
```
2025 insurable earnings ceiling: BBD 5,280/month × 12 = BBD 63,360/year
NIS insurable earnings (lower of net profit BBD 68,000 and ceiling BBD 63,360):
  = BBD 63,360
NIS rate (self-employed, effective 1 April 2025): 17.25%
NIS contribution: BBD 63,360 × 17.25% = BBD 10,929.60
```

**Payment schedule (self-employed):**
```
15 June 2025:      1st prepayment = 25% × prior year PIT
15 September 2025: 2nd prepayment = 25% × prior year PIT
15 December 2025:  3rd prepayment = 25% × prior year PIT
30 April 2026:     Balance of PIT due + NIS due by 15 January 2026
```

### Example 4 -- Minimum Wage Earner, Zero PIT

**Scenario:** Full-time worker at new minimum wage BBD 10.50/hour, 40 hours/week, full year 2025.

**Computation:**
```
Annual gross: BBD 10.50 × 40 hrs × 52 weeks = BBD 21,840
Less personal allowance:                      (BBD 25,000)
Taxable income:                                BBD 0 (negative -- clamp to zero)

PIT liability: BBD 0
```

**Note:** A full-time minimum-wage employee has zero income tax liability because gross earnings (BBD 21,840) fall below the personal allowance (BBD 25,000). (Minimum Wage (National and Sectoral Minimum Wage) (No. 2) Order, 2025 — https://barbadostoday.bb/2025/05/01/minimum-wage-increase-to-kick-in-on-june-1/)

**Reverse Tax Credit eligibility check:**
- Income ≤ BBD 25,000 ✓
- Employed (not self-employed) ✓
- Worked ≥ 4 months ✓
- Earned ≥ BBD 1,000/month (BBD 10.50 × 40 hrs × 4.33 wks ≈ BBD 1,819/month) ✓
- Income tax paid < BBD 500 (paid BBD 0) ✓
→ **Eligible for Reverse Tax Credit up to BBD 1,300.** (BRA — https://bra.gov.bb/Credits-Rebates/Reverse-Tax-Credit)

### Example 5 -- Pensioner Aged 60+, Higher Allowance

**Scenario:** Resident retiree, 65 years old, receiving a pension of BBD 36,000/year plus bank interest of BBD 500 (15% WHT already deducted at source).

**Computation:**
```
Pension income:              BBD 36,000
Bank interest:               EXCLUDE (15% WHT final tax; > BBD 100)
Less personal allowance
  (aged 60+ receiving pension): (BBD 40,000)
Taxable income:              BBD 0 (negative -- clamp to zero)

PIT liability: BBD 0
```

### Example 6 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`22/03/2025  SCOTIABANK  OWN TRANSFER TO SAVINGS  -5,000.00  BBD`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency Rules

- **Residency determination test** — A person is resident in Barbados if present for more than 182 days in the calendar year (arrival and departure both count), OR if "ordinarily resident" (has permanent accommodation available and has notified the Revenue Commissioner of intent to reside for at least 2 consecutive years).  _(Legislation: Income Tax Act, Cap. 73)_

**Residency status taxation table**  _(Source: PwC Residence — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/barbados/individual/residence)_

| Status | Taxed on |
| --- | --- |
| Resident + domiciled | Worldwide income |
| Resident + non-domiciled | Barbados-source income + foreign income where benefits are received in Barbados |
| Non-resident | Barbados-source income only; no personal allowances |

### 5.2 Income Inclusion Rules

All assessable income is reported on the PIT return filed via TAMIS. Key rules:

- **Employment income** (salaries, wages, bonuses, commissions, NIS benefits received) is assessable.
- **Self-employment income** is gross receipts minus allowable deductions.
- **Residential rental income** is taxed at 15% flat on gross receipts (not net of expenses). Do not mix with other income lines.
- **Local interest > BBD 100** — 15% WHT is a final tax; exclude from PIT return.
- **Local dividends** (post-30 June 1992) — 15% WHT is a final tax; exclude from PIT return.
- **Royalties** — 50% exempt; include only the other 50% as assessable income.
- **Capital gains** — none; Barbados has no capital gains tax.

Source: PwC Income Determination — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/barbados/individual/income-determination

### 5.3 Allowable Deductions

- **Wholly and exclusively test** — An expense is deductible if incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of assessable income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned.  _(Income Tax Act; PwC Deductions — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/barbados/individual/deductions)_

**Key deduction caps**  _(Income Tax Act; PwC Deductions — https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/barbados/individual/deductions)_

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

- **Home office deduction rules** — Calculate proportion of home used for business: dedicated room(s) as percentage of total rooms or floor area. Apply that percentage to: rent or mortgage interest, electricity, water, internet, maintenance. Must be a dedicated workspace — a dual-use room (kitchen table, dining room) does NOT qualify. Client must document the calculation and retain records. Conservative default: 0% deduction until reviewer confirms room arrangement. Flag for reviewer: Confirm room count, floor area basis, and that workspace is genuinely dedicated.  _(Legislation: Income Tax Act, Cap. 73)_

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- **Motor vehicle business use rules** — Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation is deductible. Client must maintain a mileage log (business trips vs total mileage). Capital allowance: depreciate over useful life, multiplied by business %. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm Barbados capital allowance rates by asset class.] Conservative default: 0% business use until mileage log provided.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- **Phone/internet mixed use rules** — Business use portion only is deductible. Client must provide a reasonable estimate of business vs personal use. Conservative default: 0% deduction until business percentage confirmed.

### 6.4 Rental Income -- Residential vs Commercial

- **Rental income treatment rules** — Residential rental: 15% flat on gross receipts. No expense deductions allowed against the flat-rate levy. Commercial rental: Include in assessable income at marginal PIT rates; business expenses may be deductible. Flag for reviewer: Confirm whether property is residential or commercial. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the interaction between the 15% flat rental levy and any allowable expense deductions under current BRA practice.]

### 6.5 Royalty Income Split

- **Royalty income split rule** — 50% of royalty income is exempt; only 50% is assessable. Flag for reviewer: Confirm the income is genuinely a royalty (not a fee for service).

### 6.6 Renewable Energy Deduction

- **Renewable energy deduction rule** — A 150% deduction (up to BBD 10,000/year) applies to renewable energy audits and electrical retrofitting costs within a 5-year window. Flag for reviewer: Confirm expenditure qualifies under the relevant provision and the 5-year window has not expired.

### 6.7 Bad Debt Write-Off

- **Bad debt write-off conditions** — Deductible only if: (1) income was previously declared, (2) all reasonable recovery steps taken, (3) debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag for reviewer to confirm all three conditions.

### 6.8 NIS Employer Contribution Rate Discrepancy

- **NIS employer rate discrepancy flag** — The component-by-component sum of employer NIS branches yields 13.00%; published sources commonly cite 12.75%. Flag for reviewer: Confirm the applicable employer NIS rate with NIS directly or via current NIS legislation before computing payroll.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Standard single employee, mid-range.**
Input: Single resident, gross salary BBD 45,000. No other income.
Expected: Taxable income = BBD 20,000 (45,000 − 25,000). PIT = BBD 2,500 (20,000 × 12.5%).

**Test 2 -- Pensioner aged 60+.**
Input: Resident, 63 years old, receiving pension BBD 55,000. No other income.
Expected: Taxable income = BBD 15,000 (55,000 − 40,000). PIT = BBD 1,875 (15,000 × 12.5%).

**Test 3 -- Self-employed, straddling both brackets.**
Input: Single resident, net self-employment profit BBD 90,000. No other income.
Expected: Taxable income = BBD 65,000 (90,000 − 25,000). PIT = BBD 50,000 × 12.5% + BBD 15,000 × 28.5% = BBD 6,250 + BBD 4,275 = BBD 10,525.

**Test 4 -- Self-employed NIS ceiling.**
Input: Self-employed resident, net earnings BBD 90,000, tax year 2025.
Expected: Insurable earnings capped at BBD 63,360 (= BBD 5,280/month × 12). NIS = BBD 63,360 × 17.25% = BBD 10,929.60.

**Test 5 -- Minimum wage, zero PIT.**
Input: Full-time employee at BBD 10.50/hour, 40 hours/week, 52 weeks.
Expected: Gross = BBD 21,840. Taxable income = 0 (below personal allowance of BBD 25,000). PIT = BBD 0. Reverse Tax Credit eligibility: confirm against Section 5.8 criteria.

**Test 6 -- Residential rental flat tax.**
Input: Resident, BBD 30,000 residential rental income (gross).
Expected: Rental tax = BBD 30,000 × 15% = BBD 4,500. This is a flat levy; rental income is NOT added to other income and taxed at marginal rates.

**Test 7 -- Local interest excluded.**
Input: BBD 2,000 bank interest, 15% WHT deducted at source.
Expected: EXCLUDE from PIT return — final tax already applied.

**Test 8 -- Royalty 50% exemption.**
Input: BBD 10,000 royalty income.
Expected: Assessable amount = BBD 5,000 (50% exempt). Add BBD 5,000 to assessable income; remainder is exempt.

**Test 9 -- Late filing penalty.**
Input: PIT return filed 60 days late. Tax assessed = BBD 8,000.
Expected: Fixed penalty BBD 500 + 5% of BBD 8,000 = BBD 400 = BBD 900 total initial penalty. Then 1%/month compounding on outstanding amounts from due date. (BRA FAQs — https://bra.gov.bb/FAQs/Income-Tax/)
