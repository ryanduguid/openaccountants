# Moldova Payroll Skill v0.1

> Tier 2 (research-verified). Figures below are drawn primarily from PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries (reviewed Jan 2026), EY Moldova tax alerts, and Moldovan accounting portals (buhgalter.md, salarii.md) because the State Tax Service (sfs.md), CNAS (cnas.gov.md) and CNAM (cnam.md) authority rate pages were not directly retrievable at research time (homepages did not expose the schedule; some authority pages returned HTTP 403). A Moldova-licensed accountant must confirm against the current annual Social Insurance Budget Law, the Health Insurance Fund Law and the Tax Code before sign-off.

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (flat 12%)

Moldova levies a **flat 12% personal income tax** (impozit pe venit) on employment and most other resident income under **Tax Code art. 15**. There are no progressive brackets and no marital-status scales — the same 12% applies to every individual. Non-residents are taxed at 12% on Moldovan-source income (PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, reviewed Jan 2026).

The employer withholds income tax monthly at source (PAYE-style) together with the employee social-insurance and health-insurance contributions, and remits all three on the unified monthly **Form IPC21**.

### Income Tax Rate -- 2025 (unchanged into 2026)

| Income | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly/annual taxable employment income (after CNAM and exemptions) | 12% (flat) | Tax Code art. 15; PwC, reviewed Jan 2026 |

### Special non-payroll rates (documented for completeness — NOT applied in standard payroll)

| Income type | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends | 6% | PwC (taxes on personal income) |
| Certain farming/agricultural distributions | 7% | PwC (taxes on personal income) |
| Gambling / lottery winnings | 18% | PwC (taxes on personal income) |

These are not part of standard salary withholding and are listed only so the agent does not misclassify a dividend or winnings line as employment income.

### PIT Computation Method (the calculation ORDER matters)

For each pay period, compute in this exact order (confirmed by the buhgalter.md worked example):

1. **Gross salary** = contractual gross (including meal tickets and other remunerations).
2. **Employee CNAM** = 9% × gross. CNAM is **deductible before** the income-tax base is computed.
3. **Monthly exemptions** = personal exemption + any dependent/spouse exemptions (see Section 6).
4. **PIT base** = gross − CNAM 9% − monthly exemptions.
5. **PIT** = 12% × PIT base.
6. **Employee CNAS** = 6% × gross (NOT deducted from the PIT base — it is computed on gross in parallel; PwC).

> Important: only **CNAM (9%)** and the **exemptions** reduce the PIT base. Employee CNAS (6%) does NOT reduce the PIT base in this model — it is withheld on gross in parallel. This follows the buhgalter.md worked example and the PwC deduction guidance. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the precise statutory deduction set against the current Tax Code annex, since some calculators net both contributions before PIT.

---

## Section 3 -- Social & Health Contributions -- Employee Deductions

Each month the employer withholds three amounts from the employee's gross salary: social insurance (CNAS), mandatory health insurance (CNAM), and income tax (PIT).

### Employee Deductions (2025)

| Deduction | Rate | Base | Ceiling | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance contribution (CNAS / BASS) | 6% | Gross salary + other remunerations | No ceiling on the percentage rate | PwC (other taxes) |
| Mandatory health insurance (CNAM / FAOAM) | 9% | Gross salary + other remunerations | No ceiling | PwC (other taxes) |
| Personal income tax (PIT) | 12% | Gross − CNAM 9% − exemptions | n/a (flat) | Tax Code art. 15; PwC |
| **Total employee deductions (before exemptions, no PIT exemption)** | **27% of gross (6% + 9% + 12%)** | -- | -- | buhgalter.md |

**Arithmetic check (employee column):** 6% (CNAS) + 9% (CNAM) + 12% (PIT, before exemptions) = **27%** of gross. With exemptions the effective PIT is lower, so the realised total deduction is **below** 27% — see worked examples. CNAM (9%) is fully borne by the employee; there is **no separate employer health premium** (PwC).

> Source conflict: several EOR/secondary sites show CNAM as a 4.5% employer + 4.5% employee split. The authoritative PwC position and the Tax Code treatment used here is **9% employee-only, no employer health premium**. salarii.md additionally mislabels the 9% as "CNAS" when it is CNAM. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** against the current annual Health Insurance Fund Law before relying on this for a specific employer's setup.

---

## Section 4 -- Social Contributions -- Employer Contributions

The employer pays a **social insurance contribution (CNAS / BASS) on top of gross salary**. For the standard private sector this is **24%**. There is **no separate employer-paid health-insurance percentage** on payroll — the full 9% CNAM is the employee's withheld premium (PwC).

### Employer Contribution Rates (2025)

| Employment category | Employer CNAS rate | Base | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard private sector | 24% | Gross salary + meal tickets + other remunerations | Default | PwC (other taxes) |
| Special / hazardous working conditions | 32% | Same base | Higher rate for jobs in special working conditions | PwC (other taxes) |
| Agriculture sector | 24% total = **18% employer + 6% state budget** | Same base | Employer pays only 18%; the state budget funds the remaining 6% | PwC (other taxes) |
| Higher education / certain medical institutions | 24% | Same base | Same as standard | PwC (other taxes) |
| Employer health-insurance premium | **0% (none)** | -- | No separate employer CNAM; the 9% is employee-only | PwC (other taxes) |

**Arithmetic check (agriculture row):** 18% (employer) + 6% (state budget) = **24%** total — matches the standard total but the employer outlay is only 18% of gross.

### Combined Employer + Employee Snapshot (standard private sector, before exemptions)

| Party | Components | Rate of gross |
|---|---|---|
| Employee | CNAS 6% + CNAM 9% + PIT 12% (before exemptions) | 27% |
| Employer | CNAS 24% | 24% |
| Employer health premium | none | 0% |

> There is **no general wage ceiling** on the percentage CNAS/CNAM rates for employees. Fixed-sum amounts (CNAM fixed annual MDL 12,636 for 2025/2026; CNAS fixed annual example MDL 22,878 for 2026) apply **only to non-employee categories** (self-employed) and are NOT processed through this employer-payroll skill (PwC). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact fixed-sum figures for the relevant year if a self-employed person is in scope.

---

## Section 5 -- Minimum Wage and Reference Wages

### Guaranteed Minimum Monthly Wage (whole economy)

| Period | Minimum monthly wage (MDL) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2025 (from 1 Jan 2025) | 5,500 | Up from MDL 5,000; ~MDL 32.54/hour at 169 h/month | WageIndicator.org (Jan 2025) |
| 2026 (from 1 Jan 2026) | 6,300 | Increase confirmed | Government of Moldova (gov.md, Dec 2025) |

### Reference / Average Wage

| Item | Value (MDL) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Projected average monthly wage 2025 (reference base) | 16,100 | salarii.md (2025 changes) |

Minimum wage is full-time gross. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** sector-specific or real-economy minimum wages and any 2025/2026 hourly conversions if hourly pay is in scope.

---

## Section 6 -- Personal and Dependent Exemptions

Exemptions reduce the **income-tax (PIT) base only**. They do NOT reduce the CNAS or CNAM contribution base. Apply an exemption only when the employee has declared and documented eligibility. Annual figures are converted to monthly by dividing by 12.

| Exemption | Annual (MDL) | Monthly (MDL) | Condition | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Standard personal exemption (scutire personală) | 29,700 | 2,475 | Resident individuals with annual taxable income ≤ MDL 360,000 | PwC (deductions); buhgalter.md; salarii.md |
| Major / increased personal exemption (scutire personală majorată) | 34,620 | 2,885 | Privileged categories (certain disabilities, war-injury, rehabilitated repression victims) | PwC (deductions) |
| Per dependent (scutire pentru persoane întreținute) | 9,900 | 825 | Per qualifying dependent | PwC (deductions); buhgalter.md |
| Increased dependent (severe childhood disability) | 21,780 | 1,815 | Per qualifying dependent with severe childhood disability | PwC (deductions) |
| Spouse (major) exemption | 21,780 | 1,815 | Transferable spouse exemption where the spouse does not use their own; available only against the major exemption category | PwC (deductions) |
| Income cap for the STANDARD personal exemption | 360,000/yr | -- | Standard personal exemption lost where annual taxable income exceeds this | PwC (deductions) |

**Arithmetic check (monthly conversions):** 29,700/12 = 2,475.00; 34,620/12 = 2,885.00; 9,900/12 = 825.00; 21,780/12 = 1,815.00. All exact.

> **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the exact-year (2025) figures against the Tax Policy annex: the dependent/spouse amounts (MDL 9,900 / 21,780) and major exemption (MDL 34,620) match across the PwC table (now labelled 2026) and the salarii.md 2025 table, but precise-year confirmation is advisable.

---

## Section 7 -- Conservative Defaults

When inputs are missing or ambiguous, apply these defaults and flag for the accountant:

1. **Employer CNAS rate.** Default to **24%** (standard private sector). Use 32% only if the role is confirmed to be in special/hazardous working conditions; use 18% employer + 6% state only if the employer is confirmed agriculture-sector (PwC).
2. **Health insurance split.** Treat CNAM as **9% employee-only, with no employer health premium**. Ignore secondary EOR sites showing a 4.5%/4.5% split (PwC).
3. **Calculation order.** Deduct **9% CNAM and the applicable exemptions** from gross before applying **12% PIT**; apply **6% CNAS to gross** in parallel (not deducted from the PIT base). Confirmed by the buhgalter.md worked example.
4. **No exemption unless declared.** Apply only the standard personal exemption (MDL 2,475/month) by default, and only if the employee is a resident below the MDL 360,000 income cap. Do NOT apply major, dependent, or spouse exemptions without documentation.
5. **Income cap.** If annual taxable income exceeds **MDL 360,000**, drop the standard personal exemption (PwC).
6. **Monthly IPC21 filing.** Assume the employer files Form IPC21 and remits PIT + CNAS + CNAM by the **25th of the month following** the payroll month (Rivermate; PwC).
7. **Currency.** All amounts in MDL; never convert to EUR/USD on the working paper.

## Section 8 -- Required Inputs + Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs (refuse to finalise a payroll run without these)

| Input | Why needed |
|---|---|
| Pay period and pay date (and calendar year) | Confirms which year's minimum wage / exemption figures apply |
| Gross salary for the period (incl. meal tickets and other remunerations) | Base for PIT, CNAS, CNAM |
| Residency status (resident / non-resident) | Determines exemption eligibility (exemptions are for residents) |
| Annual taxable income estimate | Determines whether the standard personal exemption is lost (> MDL 360,000) |
| Exemption declaration (personal / major / dependents / spouse) | Determines the correct PIT base |
| Employer category (standard / special-conditions / agriculture) | Determines employer CNAS rate (24% / 32% / 18%) |
| Employee personal tax code (IDNP) + CNAS/CNAM enrolment | Required to report on IPC21 |
| Year-to-date gross + PIT + CNAS + CNAM already withheld | For cumulative reconciliation |

### Refusal Catalogue (stop and ask, do not guess)

- **No exemption declaration** → default to the standard personal exemption ONLY if residency and the income cap are confirmed; otherwise refuse and ask.
- **Residency unknown** → refuse to apply any exemption; flag (non-residents are taxed at 12% on Moldovan-source income with exemption rules differing).
- **Employer category unknown** → default to 24% employer CNAS but flag explicitly; do not silently apply 32% or 18%.
- **No employee personal tax code (IDNP)** → refuse to file IPC21.
- **Annual income near or above MDL 360,000** → flag; the standard personal exemption may be lost.
- **Self-employed / fixed-sum category** → out of scope for this employer-payroll skill; redirect to a Moldova self-employed contribution skill.
- **CNAM split claimed at 4.5%/4.5%** → refuse to use; default to 9% employee-only per PwC and flag the conflict.

## Section 9 -- Transaction / Payment Pattern Library

Deterministic classification of Moldova bank-statement lines. Romanian and English descriptors both appear.

### Salary Credits (employee side)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| SALARIU, SALARY, PLATA SALARIU | Net salary payment |
| AVANS, AVANS SALARIU | Salary advance (part of net salary) |
| PREMIU, BONUS, PREMIE | Bonus / premium (taxable employment income) |
| TICHETE DE MASA, MEAL TICKETS | Meal tickets (part of remuneration base for CNAS/CNAM) |
| RESTITUIRE CNAS / CNAM | Contribution refund/adjustment — not income |

### Employer Debits (employer side)

| Pattern (statement text) | Classification |
|---|---|
| IMPOZIT PE VENIT, PIT, SFS IPC21 | Income-tax (PIT) remittance to SFS |
| CNAS, BASS, ASIG SOCIALE | Social insurance remittance (employee 6% + employer 24%) |
| CNAM, FAOAM, ASIG MEDICALA | Mandatory health-insurance remittance (employee 9%) |
| IPC21, DARE DE SEAMA IPC21 | Unified monthly payroll return payment (PIT + CNAS + CNAM) |
| SALARII, STATE DE PLATA, PAYROLL | Salary disbursement batch to employees |

> In Moldova the income tax, CNAS and CNAM are all reported on the single monthly IPC21 return and paid by the 25th of the following month. A statement may show one bundled payment or separate lines to SFS/CNAS/CNAM — confirm the split against the employer's payment records.

---

## Section 10 -- Worked Examples

All examples use 2025 rates (flat 12% PIT, employee CNAS 6%, employee CNAM 9%, employer CNAS 24% standard) and 2025 exemptions. Figures recomputed end-to-end; rounding to the cent (MDL).

### Example 1 -- Standard employee at the reference average wage, MDL 16,100/month (single, personal exemption only)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 16,100.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% (on gross) | 966.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% (on gross, deductible before PIT) | 1,449.00 |
| Personal exemption (monthly) | 2,475.00 |
| PIT base = 16,100 − 1,449 − 2,475 | 12,176.00 |
| PIT 12% = 12,176 × 12% | 1,461.12 |
| **Net pay** = 16,100 − 966 − 1,449 − 1,461.12 | **12,223.88** |

Employer cost: CNAS 24% = 16,100 × 24% = **3,864.00**; total employer outlay = 16,100 + 3,864 = **19,964.00/month**. No employer health premium.

### Example 2 -- Minimum-wage employee, MDL 5,500/month (2025, single, personal exemption)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 5,500.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% | 330.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% | 495.00 |
| Personal exemption (monthly) | 2,475.00 |
| PIT base = 5,500 − 495 − 2,475 | 2,530.00 |
| PIT 12% = 2,530 × 12% | 303.60 |
| **Net pay** = 5,500 − 330 − 495 − 303.60 | **4,371.40** |

Employer cost: CNAS 24% = 5,500 × 24% = **1,320.00**; total employer outlay = **6,820.00/month**.

### Example 3 -- Employee with two dependents, MDL 20,000/month (single, personal + 2 dependents)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 20,000.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% | 1,200.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% | 1,800.00 |
| Personal exemption (monthly) | 2,475.00 |
| Dependent exemption: 2 × 825.00 (MDL 9,900/yr each ÷ 12) | 1,650.00 |
| PIT base = 20,000 − 1,800 − 2,475 − 1,650 | 14,075.00 |
| PIT 12% = 14,075 × 12% | 1,689.00 |
| **Net pay** = 20,000 − 1,200 − 1,800 − 1,689 | **15,311.00** |

Employer cost: CNAS 24% = **4,800.00**; total employer outlay = **24,800.00/month**.

### Example 4 -- Special-conditions employee (employer CNAS 32%), MDL 18,000/month (single, personal exemption)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 18,000.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% (employee rate unchanged) | 1,080.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% | 1,620.00 |
| Personal exemption (monthly) | 2,475.00 |
| PIT base = 18,000 − 1,620 − 2,475 | 13,905.00 |
| PIT 12% = 13,905 × 12% | 1,668.60 |
| **Net pay** = 18,000 − 1,080 − 1,620 − 1,668.60 | **13,631.40** |

Employer cost: CNAS **32%** = 18,000 × 32% = **5,760.00**; total employer outlay = **23,760.00/month**. The 32% rate affects ONLY the employer side — employee deductions are identical to the standard case.

### Example 5 -- Agriculture-sector employee (employer 18% + state 6%), MDL 10,000/month (single, personal exemption)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 10,000.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% | 600.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% | 900.00 |
| Personal exemption (monthly) | 2,475.00 |
| PIT base = 10,000 − 900 − 2,475 | 6,625.00 |
| PIT 12% = 6,625 × 12% | 795.00 |
| **Net pay** = 10,000 − 600 − 900 − 795 | **7,705.00** |

Employer cost: CNAS **18%** (employer portion) = 10,000 × 18% = **1,800.00**; the remaining 6% (= 600.00) is funded by the **state budget**, not the employer. Employer outlay = 10,000 + 1,800 = **11,800.00/month**; total social contribution into the system = 1,800 + 600 = 2,400.00 (= 24% of gross).

### Example 6 -- High earner above the personal-exemption income cap, MDL 35,000/month (annual MDL 420,000 > MDL 360,000)

| Step | Amount (MDL) |
|---|---|
| Gross monthly salary | 35,000.00 |
| Employee CNAS 6% | 2,100.00 |
| Employee CNAM 9% | 3,150.00 |
| Personal exemption (annual income > MDL 360,000 → exemption LOST) | 0.00 |
| PIT base = 35,000 − 3,150 − 0 | 31,850.00 |
| PIT 12% = 31,850 × 12% | 3,822.00 |
| **Net pay** = 35,000 − 2,100 − 3,150 − 3,822 | **25,928.00** |

Employer cost: CNAS 24% = **8,400.00**; total employer outlay = **43,400.00/month**. Annual gross = 35,000 × 12 = 420,000 > 360,000, so the standard personal exemption is unavailable (PwC).

---

## Section 11 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic — apply directly)

1. Personal income tax is a **flat 12%** (Tax Code art. 15) on employment and most other resident income; non-residents 12% on Moldovan-source income (PwC).
2. Employee withholdings from gross each month: **CNAS 6% + CNAM 9% + PIT 12%** (PIT after CNAM and exemptions) (PwC; buhgalter.md).
3. **PIT base = gross − 9% CNAM − applicable monthly exemptions**; apply 12% to that base (buhgalter.md worked example).
4. Employee **CNAS 6%** is computed on **gross** and does NOT reduce the PIT base in this model (buhgalter.md).
5. Employer pays **24% CNAS** on top of gross for the standard private sector; base = gross salary + meal tickets + other remunerations (PwC).
6. Special-conditions employment employer CNAS = **32%**; agriculture sector total 24% but only **18% paid by the employer and 6% by the state budget** (PwC).
7. Mandatory health insurance (**CNAM 9%**) is fully borne by the employee — there is **no separate employer health premium** on payroll (PwC).
8. Standard annual personal exemption **MDL 29,700 (MDL 2,475/month)**, available only where annual taxable income ≤ **MDL 360,000** (PwC; EY; salarii.md).
9. Major personal exemption **MDL 34,620/yr**; per-dependent **MDL 9,900/yr**; severe-childhood-disability dependent and spouse (major) exemptions **MDL 21,780/yr** (PwC).
10. Guaranteed minimum monthly wage = **MDL 5,500** from 1 Jan 2025 (up from MDL 5,000); rises to **MDL 6,300** from 1 Jan 2026 (WageIndicator; gov.md).
11. Monthly unified payroll return **Form IPC21** (PIT + CNAS + CNAM) is filed with SFS and all amounts paid by the **25th of the following month** (Rivermate; PwC).
12. Annual individual income declaration due by **30 April** of the following year where filing is required (news-pravda Moldova).
13. Percentage rates (24% employer CNAS, 6% employee CNAS, 9% CNAM, 12% PIT) were **unchanged for 2026**, confirming continuity from 2025 (PwC / search confirmation).
14. No general wage ceiling applies to the percentage CNAS/CNAM rates for employees; fixed-sum ceilings apply only to non-employee categories (PwC).

| I. Dependent / spouse exemptions (monthly) | = 825 × dependents (+ 1,815 each for severe-disability dependent / spouse) if documented; else 0 |
| J. Employee CNAM 9% | = F × 9% |
| K. Employee CNAS 6% | = F × 6% |
| L. PIT base | = F − J − H − I |
| M. PIT 12% | = MAX(L, 0) × 12% |
| N. Monthly net pay | = F − K − J − M |
| O. Employer CNAS rate | = 24% standard / 32% special / 18% agriculture (from E) |
| P. Employer CNAS amount | = F × O |
| Q. Total employer outlay | = F + P (no employer health premium) |

Notes: (1) CNAM (J) and exemptions (H, I) reduce the PIT base; employee CNAS (K) does NOT — it is computed on gross. (2) For the agriculture category, P uses 18% (employer portion); the 6% state-budget share is not an employer outlay. (3) Never let the PIT base go negative — floor at 0.

## Section 15 -- Onboarding Fallback

If you cannot establish enough to compute payroll, gather in this order and stop where blocked:

1. **Calendar year + pay date** — selects the correct minimum wage and exemption figures.
2. **Gross monthly salary** (incl. meal tickets and other remunerations).
3. **Residency status** — determines exemption eligibility.
4. **Exemption declaration** — personal / major / dependents / spouse, with documentation.
5. **Annual income estimate** — to test the MDL 360,000 standard-exemption cap.
6. **Employer category** — standard (24%), special (32%), or agriculture (18% + 6% state).
7. **Personal tax code (IDNP) + CNAS/CNAM enrolment** — required to file IPC21.
8. **Year-to-date gross, PIT, CNAS, CNAM** — for reconciliation.

If the engagement turns out to be a self-employed person (fixed-sum CNAS/CNAM category), stop: this employer-payroll skill does not cover self-employed fixed annual contributions.

## Section 17 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (PIT + CNAS + CNAM + employer CNAS) | **This skill (moldova-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed fixed-sum CNAS/CNAM | Moldova self-employed contribution skill |
| Moldova VAT returns | moldova-vat skill |
| Moldova bookkeeping | Moldova bookkeeping skill |
| Employer corporate tax | Moldova corporate-tax skill |

### Key Handoff Points

- **Payroll → Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and employer CNAS (24% / 32% / 18%) are expenses; PIT, employee CNAS and CNAM are liabilities until remitted on IPC21.
- **Payroll → Income Tax:** Employment income and tax withheld feed the employee's annual income declaration (due 30 April) where a return is required.
- **Payroll → Social Insurance:** CNAS contributions paid through payroll count toward the employee's pension/social entitlement.

### Research Caveats (read before relying on figures)

- Confidence is **high** for the core 2025 payroll mechanics; most figures are corroborated by two or more Big-4 / official-portal sources.
- The live SFS / CNAS / CNAM rate pages were not directly retrievable at research time (homepages did not expose the schedule; intelcont/cnam pages returned HTTP 403), so primary-authority figures were corroborated via PwC and Moldovan accounting portals rather than read off the authority's own rate schedule. **Confirm against the current annual Social Insurance Budget Law, Health Insurance Fund Law and the Tax Code.**
- **CNAM split conflict:** several EOR/secondary sites present CNAM as a 4.5% employer + 4.5% employee split, while PwC and the Tax Code position state 9% employee-only with no employer health premium. The 9% employee-only position is adopted here; verify before relying on it.
- salarii.md mislabels the 9% as "CNAS" — it is CNAM.
- 2025-specific dependent/spouse exemption amounts (MDL 9,900 / 21,780) and the major exemption (MDL 34,620) are taken from PwC (now labelled 2026) and salarii.md's 2025 table; they match across both years — verify the 2025 Tax Policy annex for exact-year precision.
- No general wage ceiling applies to the percentage CNAS/CNAM rates for employees; fixed-sum ceilings apply only to non-employee (self-employed) categories.
- The daily late-payment interest rate (majorare de întârziere) is set annually by the Ministry of Finance and was not captured as a precise 2025 figure — confirm the current rate on sfs.md.

## Section 19 -- Test Suite

Each test recomputed end-to-end; expected values reconcile to the cent (2025 rates/exemptions, MDL).

1. **Flat-rate base.** Gross MDL 16,100, single, personal exemption. CNAM 9% = 1,449.00; PIT base = 16,100 − 1,449 − 2,475 = 12,176.00; PIT 12% = **1,461.12**; CNAS 6% = 966.00; net = **12,223.88**.
2. **Minimum wage net.** Gross MDL 5,500 (2025). CNAM = 495.00; PIT base = 5,500 − 495 − 2,475 = 2,530.00; PIT = **303.60**; CNAS = 330.00; net = **4,371.40**.
3. **Two dependents.** Gross MDL 20,000. Dependent exemption = 2 × 825 = 1,650.00; PIT base = 20,000 − 1,800 − 2,475 − 1,650 = 14,075.00; PIT = **1,689.00**; net = **15,311.00**.
4. **Special-conditions employer rate.** Gross MDL 18,000, single. Employee side identical to standard: CNAS = 1,080.00, CNAM = 1,620.00, PIT base = 13,905.00, PIT = **1,668.60**, net = **13,631.40**. Employer CNAS 32% = **5,760.00** (vs 4,320.00 at 24%).
5. **Agriculture split.** Gross MDL 10,000. PIT base = 10,000 − 900 − 2,475 = 6,625.00; PIT = **795.00**; net = **7,705.00**. Employer outlay = 10,000 × 18% = **1,800.00**; state-budget 6% = 600.00; total system contribution = 2,400.00 (24%).
6. **Personal-exemption income cap.** Gross MDL 35,000 (annual 420,000 > 360,000) → personal exemption = 0. PIT base = 35,000 − 3,150 = 31,850.00; PIT = **3,822.00**; CNAS = 2,100.00; CNAM = 3,150.00; net = **25,928.00**.
7. **Employee combined rate (before exemptions).** CNAS 6% + CNAM 9% + PIT 12% = **27%** of gross before exemptions; with a positive exemption the realised total is below 27%.
8. **Employer standard load.** Gross MDL 16,100 → employer CNAS 24% = **3,864.00**; no employer health premium; total outlay = **19,964.00**.
9. **CNAM employee-only.** Gross MDL 16,100 → CNAM = 16,100 × 9% = **1,449.00** borne entirely by the employee; employer CNAM = 0.00 (NOT 724.50 on a 4.5% split).
10. **Monthly exemption conversion.** Standard personal exemption MDL 29,700/yr ÷ 12 = **2,475.00/mo**; dependent MDL 9,900/yr ÷ 12 = **825.00/mo**; both exact.
11. **IPC21 deadline.** A March 2025 payroll → IPC21 filed and PIT/CNAS/CNAM paid by **25 April 2025**.
12. **IDNP refusal.** Employee with no personal tax code (IDNP) → refuse to file IPC21.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply progressive brackets — Moldova PIT is a FLAT 12% (Tax Code art. 15).
- NEVER deduct employee CNAS (6%) from the PIT base — only CNAM (9%) and exemptions reduce the PIT base; CNAS is computed on gross.
- NEVER add a separate employer health-insurance percentage — CNAM is 9% employee-only, no employer premium.
- NEVER use a 4.5%/4.5% CNAM split — default to 9% employee-only and flag the conflict.
- NEVER apply the standard personal exemption where annual taxable income exceeds MDL 360,000.
- NEVER apply major, dependent, or spouse exemptions without documented eligibility.
- NEVER use the 32% or 18% employer CNAS rate unless the employer category (special-conditions / agriculture) is confirmed — default to 24%.
- NEVER treat the agriculture 6% state-budget share as an employer outlay — the employer pays only 18%.
- NEVER miss the 25th-of-following-month IPC21 deadline — penalties and daily interest apply.
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive — always label as estimated and direct to a Moldova-licensed accountant.
