### Tax Rates (2025)

Moldova levies a **flat personal income tax**, not progressive brackets [PwC Moldova Individual -- Taxes on personal income].

| Income type | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Resident individual -- employment, professional & entrepreneurial income, capital gains, other taxable income | 12% | Flat rate, no brackets [PwC Moldova] |
| Farming / agricultural enterprises -- entrepreneurial income | 7% | Reduced rate [PwC Moldova] |
| Dividends (general) -- final withholding | 6% | Withheld at source [PwC Moldova] |
| Royalties -- final withholding | 12% | Withheld at source [PwC Moldova] |
| Gambling / lottery / sports-bet winnings -- final withholding | 18% | On the amount exceeding MDL 297 [PwC Moldova] |
| Independent retail-sale individuals (Chapter 10² regime, in force through 2025) | 1% | 1% of declared income, not less than MDL 3,000/year [PwC Moldova] |

**Moldova has no separate progressive band -- the 12% applies from the first taxable leu, after exemptions are deducted.**

### Personal & Dependent Exemptions (2025)

Available only to residents whose **annual taxable income does not exceed MDL 360,000** [PwC Moldova Individual -- Deductions; salarii.md].

| Exemption | Annual (MDL) | Monthly (MDL) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal exemption (standard) | 29,700 | 2,475 | [PwC; salarii.md] |
| Personal exemption (increased / major) | 34,620 | 2,885 | [PwC; salarii.md] |
| Spouse (major) exemption -- transferable if spouse has no income | 21,780 | 1,815 | [PwC Moldova Individual -- Deductions] |
| Dependent exemption (per dependent) | 9,900 | 825 | [PwC; salarii.md] |
| Dependent with severe childhood disability | 21,780 | 1,815 | [PwC Moldova Individual -- Deductions] |

Arithmetic check: 2,475 × 12 = 29,700; 2,885 × 12 = 34,620; 825 × 12 = 9,900; 1,815 × 12 = 21,780. ✓

### Thresholds (2025)

| Threshold | Amount (MDL) | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Personal-exemption income ceiling | 360,000 | Exemptions only if annual taxable income ≤ this | [PwC; salarii.md] |
| Mandatory VAT registration | 1,200,000 | Turnover over last 12 consecutive months (2025; raised to 1.5m from 1 Jan 2026, 1.7m from 1 Mar 2026) | [KPMG TaxNewsFlash; PwC] |
| Independent-retail minimum tax | 3,000 | 1% tax but not less than this per year | [PwC Moldova] |
| Minimum monthly wage | 5,500 | 169 hrs/month, approx MDL 32.54/hr; from 1 Jan 2025 (rises to 6,300 from 1 Jan 2026) | [Government of Moldova; WageIndicator] |
| Average monthly forecast salary | 16,100 | Used for benefit ceilings, IT-Park minimum, fine bases (rises to 17,400 for 2026) | [Government of Moldova (gov.md)] |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency | STOP -- do not apply resident rules to a non-resident |
| Unknown annual taxable income vs MDL 360,000 ceiling | Assume ceiling exceeded -> NO personal exemption (conservative) |
| Unknown whether self-employed is in justice sector | General fixed CAS (MDL 20,518), flag for reviewer |
| Unknown whether individual is employed (CNAM via payroll) or pays fixed CNAM | Assume fixed annual CNAM (MDL 12,636), flag for reviewer |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown regime (general 12% vs IT Park vs independent retail 1%) | General 12% regime |
| Unknown farming status | Standard 12% (not the 7% farming rate) |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (1) tax residency, (2) regime (general self-employed / employee / IT Park / independent retail), and (3) whether health insurance is paid via payroll (9%) or as the fixed annual premium.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, CNAS/CNAM contribution payment records, prior-year CET18 or tax assessment, VAT registration status, dependent/spouse exemption documentation.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure account, asset register, exemption certificates lodged with the employer (cerere de scutiri), proof of fixed-contribution payments, employment income statements (if mixed employed + self-employed).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This CET18 was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that each is incurred in the production of income under the Tax Code."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-MD-1 -- Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether the flat 12% resident rules and exemptions apply. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing whether the client is a Moldovan tax resident. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-MD-2 -- Income above the exemption ceiling but exemption status unclear.** "Annual taxable income near or above MDL 360,000 removes the personal exemption [PwC]. Confirm exact income and exemption entitlement with a reviewer before claiming any exemption."

**R-MD-3 -- Companies / partnerships / corporate income tax.** "This skill covers resident individuals and sole proprietors only. Legal entities (SRL, SA) file corporate income tax. Escalate to a warranted Moldovan accountant."

**R-MD-4 -- Non-resident / foreign-citizen income.** "Non-resident and foreign-citizen taxation has different rules and a 3-day filing trigger on ceasing activity [PwC]. Out of scope. Escalate to a warranted accountant."

**R-MD-5 -- Capital gains on immovable property / securities.** "Capital-gains computations require specialised analysis under the Tax Code. Escalate to a warranted accountant."

**R-MD-6 -- IT Park (MITP) resident.** "IT Park residents pay a single 7% tax on turnover that already bundles PIT, CAS and CNAM [PwC]. Do not run the general 12% computation. Use the IT-Park regime and escalate to a reviewer."

**R-MD-7 -- New independent-activity regime (Law 228/2025).** "Law No. 228/2025 introduces a new simplified freelancer regime (15% up to MDL 1,200,000, 35% above) effective 1 January 2026. It does NOT apply to tax year 2025. For 2025, the legacy rules in this skill apply [EY Tax Alert Moldova, 1 Sep 2025]."

**R-MD-8 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Tax-evasion fines run 80%-100% of the evaded amount and late-payment interest accrues daily [PwC]. Do not advise. Escalate to a warranted accountant immediately."

**R-MD-9 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax (CET18) only. For Moldova VAT, use the dedicated Moldova VAT skill."

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Client Payment (VAT-registered freelancer)

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; MAIB INCASARE ; SC EXEMPLU SRL ; PLATA FACT 2025-007 ; +12,000.00 ; MDL`

**Reasoning:**
Client payment for services. Freelancer is VAT-registered (standard 20% VAT), so MDL 12,000 includes VAT. Net = 12,000 / 1.20 = MDL 10,000 (business income). VAT MDL 2,000 is a liability to SFS, excluded from income.

**Classification:** Business income = MDL 10,000. VAT MDL 2,000 excluded. (If NOT VAT-registered, the full MDL 12,000 is business income.)

### Example 2 -- SaaS Subscription (Fully Deductible)

**Input line:**
`01.04.2025 ; MICB CARD ; ADOBE SYSTEMS IRELAND ; CREATIVE CLOUD APR ; -540.00 ; MDL`

**Reasoning:**
Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, used in producing income. Fully deductible as an operating expense.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense = MDL 540.00.

### Example 3 -- Employee Monthly Payroll (Net Pay)

**Input:** Employee, gross monthly salary MDL 16,100, standard personal exemption (MDL 2,475/month), no dependents, private sector.

**Reasoning (Tax Code Title II; buhgalter.md; playroll):**
1. Employee CAS 6%: 16,100 × 0.06 = MDL 966.00
2. Employee CNAM 9%: 16,100 × 0.09 = MDL 1,449.00
3. PIT taxable base = gross − CAS − CNAM − exemption = 16,100 − 966.00 − 1,449.00 − 2,475.00 = MDL 11,210.00
4. PIT 12%: 11,210.00 × 0.12 = MDL 1,345.20
5. Net pay = gross − CAS − CNAM − PIT = 16,100 − 966.00 − 1,449.00 − 1,345.20 = **MDL 12,339.80**

Employer also pays CAS 24% on top: 16,100 × 0.24 = MDL 3,864.00 (employer cost, not deducted from the employee).

**Classification:** PIT withheld MDL 1,345.20; net pay MDL 12,339.80; employer CAS MDL 3,864.00.

### Example 4 -- General Self-Employed Annual Computation

**Input:** Resident sole proprietor, general regime (not IT Park, not justice sector, no employees), net business income MDL 300,000, not VAT-registered, single, no dependents, NOT employed elsewhere. Annual income exceeds MDL 360,000 ceiling? No -- but it does NOT exceed it, so the personal exemption is available. (300,000 ≤ 360,000.)

**Reasoning:**
1. PIT base = net business income − personal exemption = 300,000 − 29,700 = MDL 270,300
2. PIT 12%: 270,300 × 0.12 = MDL 32,436.00
3. Fixed annual CAS (individual insurance contract, general): MDL 20,518 [State Social Insurance Budget Law 2025]
4. Fixed annual CNAM (fixed-sum premium): MDL 12,636 [IPN; logos-pres]
5. Total annual liability = 32,436.00 + 20,518 + 12,636 = **MDL 65,590.00**

**Classification:** PIT MDL 32,436.00; CAS MDL 20,518; CNAM MDL 12,636.

> Note: whether the personal exemption is deductible against entrepreneurial income (as opposed to employment income) for a sole proprietor should be confirmed by a reviewer. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exemption applicability to entrepreneurial income.] If unavailable, PIT = 300,000 × 0.12 = MDL 36,000.00 and total = MDL 69,154.00.

### Example 5 -- Dividend Receipt (Final Withholding)

**Input line:**
`20.06.2025 ; VICTORIABANK ; SC EXEMPLU SRL ; DIVIDENDE 2024 ; +47,000.00 ; MDL`

**Reasoning:**
Dividends suffer a 6% final withholding tax at source [PwC]. If MDL 47,000 is the net amount received, the gross was 47,000 / 0.94 = MDL 50,000 and the 6% tax (MDL 3,000) was already withheld. No further PIT is due; this is generally final.

**Classification:** Investment income, final WHT 6% already settled. Exclude from the 12% PIT base. Flag to reviewer whether amount shown is gross or net.

### Example 6 -- Fixed Contribution Payment (CAS)

**Input line:**
`31.03.2025 ; MAIB PLATA ; CNAS BASS ; CONTRIBUTIE FIXA 2025 ; -20,518.00 ; MDL`

**Reasoning:**
Annual fixed CAS for a self-employed individual under an individual insurance contract, general regime [State Social Insurance Budget Law 2025]. This is a contribution payment, not a business expense; it is tracked separately and reduces the PIT base only to the extent the statute allows (employee CAS/CNAM are deductible; for fixed contributions, confirm with reviewer).

**Classification:** CAS fixed contribution MDL 20,518. [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm deductibility of fixed CAS against the PIT base.]

### Example 7 -- Internal Transfer (Exclude)

**Input line:**
`15.05.2025 ; MAIB TRANSFER ; CONT PROPRIU ECONOMII ; ; -25,000.00 ; MDL`

**Reasoning:**
Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Flat 12% Rate

**Legislation:** Tax Code, Title II.

Resident individuals pay a flat 12% on employment, professional and entrepreneurial income, capital gains, and other taxable income -- there are no progressive brackets in 2025 [PwC Moldova Individual -- Taxes on personal income]. Farming/agricultural enterprises are taxed at a reduced 7% on entrepreneurial income [PwC].

### 5.2 The Monthly Payroll PIT Base

**Legislation:** Tax Code, Title II; administrative practice [buhgalter.md; playroll].

Monthly PIT base = gross salary − employee CAS (6%) − employee CNAM (9%) − applicable monthly personal/dependent exemptions. The 12% rate is applied to that base. PIT is withheld and remitted by the employer by the 25th of the following month.

### 5.3 Personal and Dependent Exemptions

- Standard personal exemption: MDL 29,700/year (MDL 2,475/month) [PwC; salarii.md].
- Increased/major personal exemption: MDL 34,620/year (MDL 2,885/month) for qualifying persons [PwC; salarii.md].
- Spouse (major) exemption: MDL 21,780/year, transferable if the spouse has no income [PwC].
- Dependent exemption: MDL 9,900/year per dependent (MDL 21,780/year for a dependent with a severe childhood disability) [PwC; salarii.md].
- **All exemptions are available only if annual taxable income does not exceed MDL 360,000** [PwC; salarii.md].

### 5.4 Deductibility of Contributions from the PIT Base

Both employee CAS (6%) and employee CNAM (9%) are deductible when computing the PIT taxable base [PwC Moldova Individual -- Deductions]. This is what makes the Example 3 base lower than gross.

### 5.5 Social Insurance (CAS / BASS)

**Legislation:** Law No. 489/1999; State Social Insurance Budget Law for 2025.

| Payer | Rate / amount | Base | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employer (private sector, standard) | 24% | Gross remuneration, meal tickets, other | No salary ceiling; 32% for special working conditions [PwC] |
| Employee | 6% | Gross salary | Withheld by employer; deductible from PIT base [buhgalter.md; rivermate; playroll] |
| Self-employed (individual insurance contract, general) | MDL 20,518/year (fixed) | -- | Annual fixed amount, 2025 [State Social Insurance Budget Law 2025] |
| Self-employed (justice sector -- lawyers, notaries, bailiffs, forensic experts, mediators, authorised administrators) | MDL 27,772/year (fixed) | -- | Annual fixed amount, 2025 [State Social Insurance Budget Law 2025] |

Agriculture: 24% total (18% employer-paid + 6% from the state budget) [PwC].

### 5.6 Health Insurance (CNAM / CAM)

**Legislation:** Law No. 1593/2002; Mandatory Health Insurance Funds Law for 2025.

| Payer | Rate / amount | Base | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee | 9% | Wages and other remuneration | Fully employee-borne; employers do NOT pay a separate percentage, only withhold and remit; deductible from PIT base [PwC; playroll; salarii.md] |
| Individual paying fixed sum (notaries, lawyers, bailiffs, family doctors in private practice, etc.) | MDL 12,636/year (fixed) | -- | Fixed annual premium, 2025 (unchanged into 2026) [IPN; logos-pres] |

> Some EOR guides report an employer health split of 4.5% / 4.5%. This is OUTDATED -- since 2021 Moldova's CNAM on salaries is a single 9% employee-borne contribution with no separate employer percentage [confirmed by PwC and playroll].

### 5.7 Contribution & Payroll Totals (Standard Private-Sector Employee)

| Component | Employee | Employer | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Social insurance (CAS / BASS) | 6% | 24% | 30% |
| Health insurance (CNAM / CAM) | 9% | 0% | 9% |
| **Total contributions** | **15%** | **24%** | **39%** |

Arithmetic check -- employee column: 6 + 9 = 15. ✓ Employer column: 24 + 0 = 24. ✓ Total column: 30 + 9 = 39, and 15 + 24 = 39. ✓ (PIT of 12% is additional and is borne by the employee on the post-contribution, post-exemption base.)

### 5.8 Final Withholding Taxes

| Income | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends (general) | 6% | [PwC] |
| Royalties | 12% | [PwC] |
| Gambling / lottery / sports winnings (on amount exceeding MDL 297) | 18% | [PwC] |

These are withheld at source and are generally final -- exclude from the 12% PIT base.

### 5.9 Independent Retail-Sale Regime (Chapter 10², 2025 only)

Individuals doing independent retail sales (not legal entities) are taxed at 1% of declared income, not less than MDL 3,000 per year [PwC]. In force during 2025; superseded by Law No. 228/2025 from 1 Jan 2026.

### 5.10 IT Park (MITP) Single Tax

Residents of the Moldova Innovation Technology Park pay a single 7% tax on turnover (excl. VAT), covering corporate income tax, employee PIT, social and health contributions, and most local/real-estate/road taxes -- but not less than a per-employee minimum equal to 30% of the average monthly forecast salary. Eligibility requires 70%+ of revenue from qualifying IT activities [PwC; deschidecompanie.md]. If a client is an IT-Park resident, do NOT run the general 12% computation (Refusal R-MD-6).

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Home Office Deduction

- Calculate the proportion of the home used for business (dedicated room(s) as a percentage of total floor area), and apply it to rent, electricity, gas, water, internet.
- A dual-use room does NOT qualify.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until the reviewer confirms the room arrangement.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm floor-area basis and that the workspace is genuinely dedicated. [RESEARCH GAP -- confirm Tax Code basis for home-office apportionment for sole proprietors.]

### 6.2 Motor Vehicle Business Use

- Only the business-use percentage of fuel, insurance, maintenance and depreciation is deductible.
- Client must maintain a mileage log.
- **Conservative default:** 0% business use until a mileage log is provided.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the business percentage is documented and reasonable.

### 6.3 Phone / Internet Mixed Use

- Business-use portion only; client must provide a reasonable estimate.
- **Conservative default:** 0% deduction until the business percentage is confirmed.

### 6.4 Depreciation / Capital Allowances

- Capital assets must be depreciated rather than expensed.
- The exact depreciation methods, asset categories and rates under the Tax Code (Art. 26-27 and Government regulation) are **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm rates, categories and method for 2025]**. Do not invent rates.
- **Flag for reviewer** on every capitalised asset.

### 6.5 Personal Exemption Entitlement

- Exemptions vanish above MDL 360,000 annual taxable income, and the application of the personal exemption to entrepreneurial (as opposed to employment) income for sole proprietors should be confirmed.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm exemption entitlement and the precise income definition used for the ceiling test.

### 6.6 Deductibility of Self-Employed Fixed Contributions

- Employee CAS (6%) and CNAM (9%) are explicitly deductible from the PIT base [PwC]. Whether the fixed annual CAS (MDL 20,518) and fixed CNAM (MDL 12,636) reduce a self-employed person's PIT base is **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]**.

### 6.7 Bad Debt Write-Off

- Deductible only if income was previously declared, recovery steps were taken, and the debt is genuinely irrecoverable. Flag all three conditions for the reviewer.

### Caveats (read before relying on figures)

- PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries pages were last reviewed 14 January 2026 and now display 2026 figures; the 2025 exemption amounts (MDL 29,700 / 34,620 / 21,780 / 9,900), which are unchanged into 2026, were independently confirmed against 2025-specific Moldovan sources (salarii.md, buhgalter.md).
- The exact 2025 fixed annual CAS amounts (general MDL 20,518; justice MDL 27,772) come from the State Social Insurance Budget Law for 2025 reported via secondary aggregators (cis-legislation, WebSearch); the primary cis-legislation page could not be fetched directly. **The official CNAS / sfs.md figures should be confirmed before publishing.** [RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm exact 2025 fixed-contribution MDL digits.]
- The MDL 12,636 fixed annual CNAM premium for 2025 is confirmed unchanged into 2026 [IPN; logos-pres].
- The 4.5% / 4.5% employer health split seen in some EOR guides is OUTDATED -- CNAM on salaries is a single 9% employee-borne contribution.
- The late-payment interest rate is set annually (NBM rate +5pp = 9% p.a. for 2025). The 0.0301%/day figure on PwC's individual page reflects a later period.
- The 1% independent-retail regime and the old independent-activity regime are superseded by Law No. 228/2025 effective 1 Jan 2026 -- for 2025 the legacy rules apply.
- **Recommend a verified accountant confirm the exact 2025 fixed-contribution MDL figures, the depreciation rates, and the personal-exemption income ceiling against the SFS Tax Code and the 2025 social-insurance budget law before relying on them.**

### Test Suite

**Test 1 -- Standard private-sector employee, monthly payroll.**
Input: Gross MDL 16,100/month, standard personal exemption MDL 2,475, no dependents.
Expected: Employee CAS = MDL 966.00; CNAM = MDL 1,449.00; PIT base = 16,100 − 966 − 1,449 − 2,475 = MDL 11,210.00; PIT 12% = MDL 1,345.20; net pay = MDL 12,339.80; employer CAS 24% = MDL 3,864.00.

**Test 2 -- General self-employed, exemption available.**
Input: Net business income MDL 300,000 (≤ 360,000 ceiling), single, no dependents, general regime, exemption applies.
Expected: PIT base = 300,000 − 29,700 = MDL 270,300; PIT 12% = MDL 32,436.00; fixed CAS MDL 20,518; fixed CNAM MDL 12,636; total = MDL 65,590.00.

**Test 3 -- General self-employed, NO exemption (income over ceiling).**
Input: Net business income MDL 500,000 (> 360,000), general regime.
Expected: No personal exemption. PIT 12% = 500,000 × 0.12 = MDL 60,000.00; fixed CAS MDL 20,518; fixed CNAM MDL 12,636; total = MDL 93,154.00.

**Test 4 -- Farming enterprise (reduced rate).**
Input: Entrepreneurial income of a farming enterprise MDL 200,000, 7% rate.
Expected: PIT = 200,000 × 0.07 = MDL 14,000.00.

**Test 5 -- Justice-sector self-employed contributions.**
Input: Notary, general 12% PIT on net income MDL 400,000 (no exemption, over ceiling).
Expected: PIT 12% = MDL 48,000.00; fixed CAS MDL 27,772 (justice); fixed CNAM MDL 12,636; total = MDL 88,408.00.

**Test 6 -- Dividend final withholding.**
Input: Net dividend received MDL 47,000 (6% WHT already taken).
Expected: Gross = 47,000 / 0.94 = MDL 50,000.00; WHT 6% = MDL 3,000.00; no further PIT; exclude from 12% base.

**Test 7 -- VAT-registered freelancer client payment.**
Input: Client payment MDL 12,000 incl. 20% VAT.
Expected: Net business income = 12,000 / 1.20 = MDL 10,000.00; VAT MDL 2,000 excluded.

**Test 8 -- Independent retail minimum tax.**
Input: Independent retail individual, declared income MDL 200,000 (Chapter 10², 2025).
Expected: 1% = 200,000 × 0.01 = MDL 2,000.00; but not less than MDL 3,000 -> tax = MDL 3,000.00.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply resident rules without confirming Moldovan tax residency
- NEVER claim a personal exemption when annual taxable income exceeds MDL 360,000
- NEVER apply progressive brackets -- Moldova PIT is a flat 12% (7% farming) in 2025
- NEVER run the general 12% computation for an IT-Park resident (single 7% turnover tax instead)
- NEVER apply the Law 228/2025 freelancer regime (15%/35%) to tax year 2025 -- it begins 1 Jan 2026
- NEVER add a separate employer health-insurance percentage -- CNAM is a single 9% employee-borne contribution
- NEVER include VAT collected on sales in business income for a VAT-registered client
- NEVER include final-withheld dividends/royalties/winnings in the 12% PIT base
- NEVER invent depreciation rates -- they are a RESEARCH GAP pending reviewer confirmation
- NEVER allow income tax, fines, drawings, or personal expenses as deductions
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated and pending accountant sign-off
