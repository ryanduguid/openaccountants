### 4.3 Common ATCs for Professional Fees

- Payees should collect Form 2307 from all payors every quarter
- Attach all Forms 2307 to the annual ITR (Form 1701/1701A)

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples

### Example 1 -- Professional Fee with EWT

**Situation:** CPA bills client ₱100,000 for consulting. CPA's annual gross receipts are under ₱3M and sworn declaration has been submitted.

**Withholding:** ₱100,000 × 5% = ₱5,000 withheld. Client pays ₱95,000 net and issues Form 2307 for ₱5,000.

**CPA's ITR:** Reports ₱100,000 gross income. Claims ₱5,000 creditable tax.

### Example 2 -- No Sworn Declaration Submitted

**Situation:** Same CPA, but did not submit Annex B-1.

**Withholding:** Higher rate applies: ₱100,000 × 10% = ₱10,000. Client pays ₱90,000 net.

### Example 3 -- Corporate Payee

**Situation:** Accounting firm (corporation) bills ₱500,000. Annual gross >₱720,000.
