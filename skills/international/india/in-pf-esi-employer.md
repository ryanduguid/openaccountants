## Section 2 -- EPF Detailed Rules

### 2.1 Wage Components for PF

| Included in Basic + DA (PF Wages) | Excluded from PF Wages |
|---|---|
| Basic salary | House Rent Allowance (HRA) |
| Dearness Allowance (DA) | Overtime allowance |
| Retaining allowance | Bonus (statutory or otherwise) |
| Cash value of food concession (if not provided) | Commission |
| | Conveyance allowance |
| | Retrenchment compensation |
| | Gratuity |

**PF wage ceiling (voluntary cap):** ₹15,000/month is the statutory wage ceiling for EPF. Employers may choose to contribute on actual Basic + DA even if above ₹15,000 (most large employers do this). EPS is always capped at ₹15,000/month.

### 2.2 Employer 12% Breakup

| Component | Rate | Cap |
|---|---|---|
| EPF account (employee's individual PF) | 3.67% | On full PF wages |
| EPS (Pension fund) | 8.33% | Capped at ₹15,000/month (max ₹1,250/month to EPS) |
| If PF wages > ₹15,000 | Balance of 8.33% above cap goes to EPF | Full 12% effectively goes to EPF |

**Example:** Employee with Basic + DA = ₹30,000/month:
- Employer EPF = ₹30,000 × 3.67% = ₹1,101
- Employer EPS = ₹15,000 × 8.33% = ₹1,250 (capped)
- Remaining to EPF = (₹30,000 × 8.33%) − ₹1,250 = ₹2,499 − ₹1,250 = ₹1,249
- Total employer to EPF account = ₹1,101 + ₹1,249 = ₹2,350
- Total employer contribution = ₹30,000 × 12% = ₹3,600 (split between EPF and EPS)

### 2.3 EDLI (Employees' Deposit Linked Insurance)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Purpose | Life insurance for EPF members |
| Employer contribution | 0.50% of Basic + DA (capped at ₹15,000/month) |
| Maximum EDLI contribution | ₹75/month per employee |
| Benefit on death | Up to ₹7,00,000 (₹7 lakh) |
| Employee contribution | Nil |

### 2.4 International Workers

| Scenario | PF Treatment |
|---|---|
| Indian employee sent abroad (no SSA country) | PF continues on Indian salary |
| Foreign national working in India (from SSA country) | Exempt from PF if covered in home country |
| Foreign national from non-SSA country | PF mandatory at full rate |

SSA = Social Security Agreement (India has SSAs with ~20 countries).

| DA | Retrenchment compensation |
| HRA | Encashment of leave on superannuation |
| City Compensatory Allowance | Gratuity |

### 3.4 Crossing the ESI Threshold

If an employee's wages exceed ₹21,000/month mid-contribution period:

## Section 5 -- Computation Examples

### Example 1: Standard Employee (PF + ESI applicable)

Employee: Basic = ₹12,000/month, DA = ₹3,000/month, HRA = ₹5,000/month
Gross = ₹20,000/month (below ₹21,000 ESI threshold)

| Component | Employer | Employee |
|---|---|---|
| EPF (on Basic + DA = ₹15,000) | ₹15,000 × 3.67% = ₹550.50 | ₹15,000 × 12% = ₹1,800 |
| EPS (capped at ₹15,000) | ₹15,000 × 8.33% = ₹1,249.50 | Nil |
| Total PF employer | ₹1,800 (12% of ₹15,000) | ₹1,800 |
| EDLI | ₹15,000 × 0.50% = ₹75 | Nil |
| PF Admin | ₹15,000 × 0.50% = ₹75 | Nil |
| ESI (on gross ₹20,000) | ₹20,000 × 3.25% = ₹650 | ₹20,000 × 0.75% = ₹150 |
| **Total employer cost** | **₹2,600** | -- |
| **Total employee deduction** | -- | **₹1,950** |

### Example 2: Higher Salary (PF only, ESI not applicable)

Employee: Basic + DA = ₹40,000/month, Gross = ₹65,000/month (above ₹21,000 ESI threshold)

| Component | Employer | Employee |
|---|---|---|
| EPF (on ₹40,000, if contributing on actual) | ₹40,000 × 3.67% = ₹1,468 | ₹40,000 × 12% = ₹4,800 |
| EPS (capped at ₹15,000) | ₹15,000 × 8.33% = ₹1,250 | Nil |
| Remaining to EPF | ₹40,000 × 8.33% − ₹1,250 = ₹2,082 | Nil |
| Total PF employer | ₹4,800 (12% of ₹40,000) | ₹4,800 |
| EDLI | ₹15,000 × 0.50% = ₹75 | Nil |
| PF Admin | ₹40,000 × 0.50% = ₹200 | Nil |
| ESI | Not applicable (gross > ₹21,000) | Not applicable |
| **Total employer cost** | **₹5,075** | -- |

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### 6.1 Establishments with < 20 Employees
EPF is mandatory for establishments with 20+ employees. Establishments with fewer may voluntarily register. Once registered, coverage continues even if numbers drop below 20.

### 6.2 Contract Labour
The principal employer is responsible for PF/ESI of contract workers if the contractor fails to deposit. Both principal employer and contractor must be registered.

### 6.3 Fixed-Term Employees
Fixed-term employees are entitled to same PF/ESI benefits as regular employees from day one. No waiting period.

### 6.4 Exempted Establishments (PF Trust)
Large employers may apply for EPF exemption to manage their own PF trust. Must provide equal or better benefits. Trust must maintain accounts as per EPFO norms.

### 6.5 VPF (Voluntary Provident Fund)
Employee may contribute above 12% voluntarily (up to 100% of Basic + DA). Employer contribution remains at 12% -- no additional employer obligation for VPF.

### 6.6 New Establishments
A new establishment must register with EPFO within one month of employing 20 persons. ESI registration within 15 days of applicability.

## Section 7 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER compute PF on gross salary -- PF is on Basic + DA only
- NEVER exceed the EPS ceiling (₹15,000/month) for pension calculation
- NEVER apply ESI to employees earning above ₹21,000/month gross (unless mid-period crossing)
- NEVER miss the 15th of the month deadline without accounting for interest/damages
- NEVER assume all establishments are covered -- verify employee count threshold
- NEVER confuse employer contribution rate (12%) with employee rate (12%) -- they are separate obligations
- NEVER ignore admin charges and EDLI when computing total employer cost
- NEVER present calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
