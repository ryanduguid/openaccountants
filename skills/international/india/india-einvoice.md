---

## Section 2 -- Mandate Scope

### Who Must Comply

- Any GST-registered taxpayer whose **aggregate annual turnover (AATO)** exceeded Rs 5 crore in **any financial year from FY 2017-18 onwards**
- Once the threshold is crossed in any past year, the obligation is **permanent** even if current-year turnover drops below Rs 5 crore
- Covers: B2B supply invoices, B2B credit notes, B2B debit notes, exports, supplies to SEZ units

### Document Types Covered

| Document | IRP Document Type Code |
|---|---|
| Tax Invoice | INV |
| Credit Note | CRN |
| Debit Note | DBN |

### Exempted Categories

- B2C invoices (not reportable to IRP)
- SEZ units themselves (when issuing)
- Insurance companies, banking companies, financial institutions, NBFCs
- Goods transport agencies (GTA)
- Passenger transport services
- Cinema ticket admissions

### Time Limit for Reporting

| Taxpayer AATO | Reporting Deadline |
|---|---|
| > Rs 100 crore | Within 7 days of invoice date |
| > Rs 10 crore | Within 30 days of invoice date (from 1 April 2025) |
| Up to Rs 10 crore | No specific time limit (expected to extend) |

After the deadline expires, the IRP permanently rejects IRN generation for that document.

## Section 3 -- Technical Format

### Schema Specification

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Format | JSON (not XML) |
| Schema Name | GST INV-01 |
| Current API Version | v1.04 |
| Character Encoding | UTF-8 |
| Date Format | DD/MM/YYYY |
| Decimal Precision | 2 decimal places for amounts |

### JSON Structure (Top-Level Objects)

```json
{
  "Version": "1.1",
  "TranDtls": { },
  "DocDtls": { },
  "SellerDtls": { },
  "BuyerDtls": { },
  "DispDtls": { },
  "ShipDtls": { },
  "ItemList": [ ],
  "ValDtls": { },
  "PayDtls": { },
  "RefDtls": { },
  "AddlDocDtls": [ ],
  "ExpDtls": { },
  "EwbDtls": { }
}
```

### IRN Generation Algorithm

The IRN is a **64-character SHA-256 hash** computed by the IRP from four fields:
1. Supplier GSTIN
2. Financial Year (derived from invoice date)
3. Document Type Code
4. Document Number

The taxpayer does NOT generate the IRN — the IRP returns it after successful validation.

## Section 5 -- Transmission Method

### API Integration (Recommended)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Production Base URL | https://einvapi.gst.gov.in |
| Sandbox Base URL | https://einv-apisandbox.nic.in |
| Auth Endpoint | /eivital/v1.04/auth |
| Invoice Generation | POST /eivital/v1.04/Invoice |
| Cancel IRN | POST /eivital/v1.04/Invoice/Cancel |
| Get Invoice by IRN | GET /eivital/v1.04/Invoice/irn/{irn} |

| client-secret | Issued by IRP on registration |
| user_name | Taxpayer's IRP portal username |
| Gstin | Taxpayer's GSTIN |

2. **Bulk upload** — JSON file upload via IRP web portal (small-volume fallback)
3. **Offline tool** — Excel-to-JSON converter on IRP portal (emergency/testing only)

---

## Section 6 -- Validation Rules

### IRP Pre-Checks (Real-Time)

1. GSTIN validity — both seller and buyer must be active GSTINs
2. Duplicate check — combination of seller GSTIN + doc type + doc number + FY must be unique
3. Date validation — invoice date cannot be future; cannot exceed time limit
4. HSN validation — must exist in master; 8-digit for goods if AATO > Rs 5 crore
5. Mathematical validation — line item totals must sum to document totals (tolerance: Rs 1)
6. State code / PIN code consistency
7. Tax rate validation — GST rate must be a valid rate (0, 0.1, 0.25, 1, 1.5, 3, 5, 6, 7.5, 12, 14, 18, 28)

### Common Rejection Reasons

| Error Code | Description | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| 2150 | Duplicate IRN | Invoice already reported — check if IRN exists |
| 2163 | Document date exceeds time limit | Cannot fix; issue fresh invoice with new number |
| 2174 | GSTIN not enabled for e-invoicing | Verify IRP registration |
| 2283 | HSN code invalid | Update to valid 4/6/8 digit HSN |
| 2269 | Item value mismatch | Recalculate: TotAmt = Qty × UnitPrice |
| 2287 | Total invoice value mismatch | Verify ValDtls.TotInvVal = sum of all components |

---

## Section 7 -- Tax Computation Rules

### Tax Amount Calculation

- **Intra-state supply**: Split into CGST + SGST (each = half of applicable GST rate)
- **Inter-state supply**: Full IGST (= full applicable GST rate)
- Place of supply (BuyerDtls.Pos) determines intra vs inter-state

### Rounding Rules

- All amounts rounded to 2 decimal places
- Rounding tolerance at document level: Rs 1 (IRP accepts ±1 difference between sum of line items and document total)
- Round each line item independently, then sum

### Multi-Rate Invoice

- Each line item carries its own GstRt
- ValDtls aggregates all IGST/CGST/SGST across items
- No restriction on mixing rates within a single invoice

### Discount Handling

- Discount applied at item level: AssAmt = TotAmt - Discount
- Tax calculated on AssAmt (assessable amount), not gross amount

---

## Section 8 -- Archiving Requirements

| Requirement | Detail |
|---|---|
| Retention Period | Minimum 6 years from due date of annual return (GSTR-9) for the relevant FY; 8 years recommended |
| Format | Original JSON submitted + signed JSON returned by IRP (with IRN and QR) |
| Digital Signature | IRP signs the returned payload with its private key; retain the signed response |
| QR Code | Must appear on printed/PDF invoice; contains IRN, invoice date, supplier GSTIN, buyer GSTIN, invoice value, number of line items, HSN codes, unique hash |
| Storage Medium | No specific medium mandated; must be producible on demand during audit |
| GSTR-1 Linkage | IRP auto-pushes e-invoice data to GSTR-1; retain confirmation of auto-population |

---

## Section 9 -- Penalties for Non-Compliance

| Offence | Penalty | Legal Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Issuing invoice without valid IRN when required | Rs 10,000 per invoice OR 100% of tax involved, whichever is higher | Section 122(1)(i) CGST Act |
| Issuing incorrect or false invoice | Up to Rs 25,000 per invoice | Section 122(3) CGST Act |
| Fake invoicing (invoice without actual supply) | 100% of tax evaded or ITC availed (min Rs 10,000) | Section 122(1)(ii) CGST Act |
| General penalty (no specific clause) | Up to Rs 25,000 | Section 125 CGST Act |
| Buyer consequence — ITC denial | Buyer cannot claim Input Tax Credit on invoice without valid IRN | Rule 48(5) CGST Rules |
| Repeated default | GSTIN suspension possible | Section 29(2) CGST Act |

### Cascading Impact

An invoice without IRN is not a valid tax invoice under Rule 48(5). The buyer's ITC claim is denied, which creates commercial pressure on the supplier to comply.

---

## Section 10 -- Interaction with Tax Skills

### GSTR-1 Auto-Population

- IRP pushes validated e-invoice data to GSTR-1 the next day
- Supplier does NOT need to manually enter these invoices in GSTR-1
- If discrepancies exist between e-invoice and manually entered GSTR-1 data, the e-invoice data prevails

### E-Way Bill Integration

- If supply value > Rs 50,000 and goods are being transported, e-way bill can be generated in the same API call
- Set EwbDtls fields (TransId, TransName, Distance, TransDocNo, TransDocDt, VehNo, VehType)
- Single API call generates both IRN and EWB number

### GSTR-2B / ITC Matching

- Buyer's GSTR-2B auto-populated from supplier's e-invoices
- Facilitates ITC matching and reconciliation
- Discrepancies flagged automatically in GSTR-2B

### Annual Return (GSTR-9)

- E-invoice data feeds into annual return reconciliation
- Auditors can cross-verify GSTR-9 figures against IRP-reported data
