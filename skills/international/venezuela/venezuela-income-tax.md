  Use this skill whenever asked about Venezuela personal income tax (ISLR — Impuesto Sobre la Renta) for resident or non-resident individuals, self-employed professionals, and contractors. Trigger on phrases like "how much ISLR do I pay", "Venezuela income tax", "declaración definitiva de rentas", "Unidad Tributaria", "UT", "tarifa 1", "sustraendo", "desgravamen único", "rebajas personales", "RIF", "SENIAT", "estimated return", "declaración estimada", "retención ISLR", "self-employed tax Venezuela", "bonos vs salario", or any question about filing or computing ISLR for an individual in Venezuela. Also trigger when preparing or reviewing a Venezuelan annual income tax return, computing deductions in Tax Units, or advising on withholding and social-security parafiscal contributions. This skill covers the UT mechanism, the Tarifa Nº 1 graduated schedule, sustraendos, standard vs itemized deductions, personal credits, the 31 March deadline, social-security/parafiscal regimes, and the hyperinflationary dual-track measurement reality. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Venezuela income tax work.

# Venezuela Income Tax (ISLR) — Individual Skill v0.1

---

## Critical Structural Warning — Read First

Venezuela is a **hyperinflationary economy with a dual-track measurement system**. Three caveats govern everything below:

1. **ISLR brackets, deductions and credits are denominated in Tax Units (Unidad Tributaria / UT)**, not in bolívares directly. You must convert UT → VES using the current UT value before quoting any bolívar figure. (PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)
2. **Penalties are NO LONGER in UT.** Since the 2020 reform of the Código Orgánico Tributario (COT Art. 91), pecuniary fines stated as a multiple are calculated using the **official exchange rate of the highest-value currency published by the BCV** (effectively the USD rate) on the **date of payment**. (COT Art. 91, 2020 reform.)
3. **The legal minimum wage (Bs. 130/month, frozen since 15 March 2022, Decreto 4.653) is economically negligible** (~USD 0.50/month by Dec 2025). The real income floor is delivered via **non-salary "bonos"** (the "ingreso mínimo integral indexado" of ~USD 160/month, announced 30 April 2025). Do NOT treat the legal minimum wage as the economic minimum, and note that bonos are excluded from the salary base for social security and largely from the ISLR salary base. (Decreto 4.653; executive announcement 30 April 2025.)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Country | Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) |
| Tax | ISLR — Impuesto Sobre la Renta (personal income tax) |
| Currency | Bolívar (VES / Bs.) — brackets denominated in Tax Units (UT) |
| Tax year | Calendar year (1 January – 31 December) for wage earners; business-engaged individuals may elect an alternative 12-month period (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026) |
| Primary legislation | Ley de Impuesto Sobre la Renta (LISLR) |
| Supporting legislation | Código Orgánico Tributario (COT); Decreto 1.808 (ISLR withholdings); SNAT/2025/000048 (UT value) |
| Tax authority | SENIAT — Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administración Aduanera y Tributaria |
| Social security authority | IVSS — Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales (plus parafiscal regimes) |

### Tax Unit (UT) — the master variable

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Current UT value | VES 43.00 | SNAT/2025/000048, Official Gazette 2 June 2025, effective same date |
| Previous UT value | VES 9.00 | SNAT (prior ruling) |
| Increase | ~377.8% | Derived from VES 9.00 → VES 43.00 |

**The UT is set by SENIAT administrative ruling on no fixed schedule.** ISLR brackets, deductions, credits and filing thresholds are all expressed in UT. Convert UT → VES at VES 43.00/UT for the 2025 reporting cycle.

### Resident Graduated Rate Schedule (Tarifa Nº 1)

Income measured in **UT**. Apply the marginal rate to total taxable income, then subtract the **sustraendo** (a fixed UT deduction that makes the schedule continuous). Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 (LISLR Tarifa Nº 1).

| Taxable income (UT) | Rate | Sustraendo (UT) | Cumulative tax at top of band (UT) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 – 1,000 | 6% | 0 | 60 |
| 1,000 – 1,500 | 9% | 30 | 105 |
| 1,500 – 2,000 | 12% | 75 | 165 |
| 2,000 – 2,500 | 16% | 155 | 245 |
| 2,500 – 3,000 | 20% | 255 | 345 |
| 3,000 – 4,000 | 24% | 375 | 585 |
| 4,000 – 6,000 | 29% | 575 | 1,165 |
| Over 6,000 | 34% | 875 | — |

**Tax = (rate × taxable income in UT) − sustraendo, then × UT value for the VES figure.** The sustraendos make the schedule continuous (each band's cumulative tax at its ceiling equals the next band's value at the same point — verified).

### Non-Resident Rates (flat, withheld at source)

| Income type | Rate | Effective rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Salary / services performed in Venezuela | 34% flat | 34% of gross | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Professional non-business activities | 34% on 90% of gross | ~30.6% of gross | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown residency status | STOP — do not apply a rate basis without residency (worldwide vs Venezuelan-source) |
| Unknown deduction method | Standard deduction (desgravamen único 774 UT) — blocks itemized |
| Unknown whether income is salary or non-salary bono | Treat as bono (excluded from salary base) only if explicitly confirmed; otherwise treat as salary |
| Unknown UT value for a prior year | STOP — confirm the UT ruling in force for that tax year |
| Unknown business-use % | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown taxpayer marital/dependant status | Apply taxpayer credit (10 UT) only; do not assume spouse/dependant credits |
| Unknown VES amount where only UT is given | Convert at VES 43.00/UT (2025) and flag the UT value used |

## Section 2 — Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement(s) for the full tax year (PDF, CSV, or pasted text), confirmation of residency status (resident worldwide / non-resident Venezuelan-source), and the RIF status of the individual.

**Recommended** — invoices issued and received, ISLR withholding certificates (comprobantes de retención), prior-year declaración definitiva de rentas, confirmation of marital/dependant status for credits, and the UT value in force for the year.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure record, documentation for any itemized desgravámenes (education, insurance, medical, mortgage interest, rent), social-security/parafiscal payment records, and any estimated-return (declaración estimada) filings.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without supporting documents = proceed with reviewer warning: "This ISLR computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify residency basis, that any itemized desgravámenes are documented and paid to Venezuelan entities where required, and that bonos vs salary classification is correct."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-VE-1 — Residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether worldwide or only Venezuelan-source income is taxed. This skill cannot compute ISLR without it. Please confirm resident vs non-resident status before proceeding."

**R-VE-2 — Companies / partnerships / group structures.** "This skill covers individuals (including self-employed professionals and contractors) only. Companies and other entities follow corporate ISLR rules. Escalate to a Venezuelan licensed tax professional."

**R-VE-3 — Prior-year or future-year UT value not confirmed.** "ISLR brackets are denominated in Tax Units. Without the UT value in force for the relevant tax year, no bolívar figure can be produced. Confirm the SENIAT UT ruling for that year before proceeding."

**R-VE-4 — Penalties / SENIAT enforcement.** "COT penalties are calculated in multiples of the BCV highest-value-currency exchange rate at the date of payment and can be severe (150–300×). Do not advise on penalty exposure. Escalate to a Venezuelan licensed tax professional immediately."

**R-VE-5 — Hyperinflation / inflationary-adjustment accounting.** "Inflationary adjustment (ajuste por inflación) and multi-currency measurement issues require specialised analysis. Out of scope for individual salary/professional ISLR. Escalate."

**R-VE-6 — VAT (IVA) return requested.** "This skill covers ISLR (income tax) only. Venezuelan IVA is a separate 16% regime; use a dedicated VAT skill or escalate."

## Section 3 — Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5. Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific.

Note: Venezuelan bank statements are typically in **bolívares (VES / Bs.)**; some accounts and payments operate in **USD**. Always record the currency and convert USD lines to VES at the applicable BCV rate before aggregating.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Abonos)

| Pattern | ISLR Line | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Client name + TRANSFERENCIA, ABONO, PAGO RECIBIDO, DEPÓSITO | Gross income (ingreso bruto) | Business/professional income | If IVA charged, extract net of 16% IVA |

## Section 4 — Worked Examples

All examples use **UT value = VES 43.00** (SNAT/2025/000048).

### Example 1 — Professional fee received (resident self-employed)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; BANESCO ; ABONO TRANSFERENCIA ; CLIENTE ACME C.A. ; HONORARIOS FACTURA 0012 ; +860.000,00 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Professional fee for services rendered in Venezuela. If IVA was charged, the gross includes 16% IVA which is a liability to SENIAT, not income. Assuming no IVA charged here (e.g. below threshold / exempt), the full VES 860,000 is gross professional income. Convert to UT for the bracket computation: 860,000 ÷ 43 = 20,000.00 UT.

**Classification:** Gross income = VES 860,000 (20,000 UT).

### Example 2 — Standard deduction and full ISLR computation (resident)

**Input:** Resident individual, gross income 20,000 UT (VES 860,000), elects the standard deduction (desgravamen único 774 UT), married with two qualifying children.

**Reasoning (recomputed end-to-end):**
- Gross income: 20,000 UT
- Less desgravamen único: 774 UT
- Taxable income: 20,000 − 774 = 19,226 UT
- Taxable income is in the "Over 6,000" band → rate 34%, sustraendo 875 UT
- Tax = (0.34 × 19,226) − 875 = 6,536.84 − 875 = **5,661.84 UT**
- In VES: 5,661.84 × 43 = **VES 243,459.12**
- Credits (rebajas): taxpayer 10 UT + spouse 10 UT + 2 children × 10 UT = 40 UT = 40 × 43 = VES 1,720
- Tax after credits: 243,459.12 − 1,720 = **VES 241,739.12**
- Less withholdings suffered during the year: VES 5,300
- **Amount due: 241,739.12 − 5,300 = VES 236,439.12**

**Classification:** Tax due = VES 236,439.12. (Matches PwC sample calculation, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

### Example 3 — Itemized desgravámenes with rent cap

**Input:** Resident, gross 8,000 UT. Documented rent on primary home VES 50,000/month × 12 = VES 600,000 = 13,953.49 UT. Education VES 86,000 = 2,000 UT. Elects itemized.

**Reasoning:**
- Rent desgravamen is **capped at 800 UT/year** (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026). Documented rent of 13,953.49 UT exceeds the cap → allow **800 UT only**.
- Education: no stated cap → allow 2,000 UT.
- Total itemized desgravámenes: 800 + 2,000 = 2,800 UT.
- Taxable income: 8,000 − 2,800 = 5,200 UT.
- Band 4,000–6,000 → rate 29%, sustraendo 575 UT.
- Tax = (0.29 × 5,200) − 575 = 1,508 − 575 = **933 UT** = 933 × 43 = **VES 40,119.00** (before credits).

**Classification:** Rent capped at 800 UT; taxable 5,200 UT; tax 933 UT (VES 40,119.00) before rebajas.

### Example 4 — Non-resident professional fee (flat rate, withheld)

**Input line:**
`10/05/2025 ; MERCANTIL ; PAGO HONORARIOS ; CONSULTOR NO RESIDENTE ; SERVICIOS PROFESIONALES ; +200.000,00 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Non-resident performing professional non-business activity. Rate is 34% applied to **90% of gross** (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026), withheld at source.
- Base: 90% × 200,000 = VES 180,000
- Withholding: 34% × 180,000 = **VES 61,200** (effective 30.6% of gross)

**Classification:** Withholding tax = VES 61,200 (34% on 90% of gross).

### Example 5 — Cestaticket / bono received (non-salary)

**Input line:**
`28/04/2025 ; BDV ; ABONO ; CESTATICKET SOCIALISTA ; ABRIL 2025 ; +XXX,XX ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Cestaticket and the "Bono contra la Guerra Económica" are **non-salary bonos** (ingreso mínimo integral indexado, ~USD 160/month, executive announcement 30 April 2025). They are excluded from the social-security base and largely from the ISLR salary base. Flag for reviewer — do not include in the salary base without confirmation.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from salary base (reviewer to confirm). Not severance/aguinaldo/pension base.

### Example 6 — ISLR withholding suffered (credit, not expense)

**Input line:**
`30/06/2025 ; BANESCO ; RETENCIÓN ISLR ; CLIENTE BETA C.A. ; COMPROBANTE 2025-44 ; -X.XXX,XX ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
ISLR withheld by a client on professional fees is **not an expense** — it is a prepayment of the individual's final tax. It offsets the final liability (as in Example 2's "withholdings suffered" line). Retain the comprobante de retención.

**Classification:** Credit against final ISLR liability. NOT a deductible expense.

## Section 5 — Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Residency basis

| Status | Tax base | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Resident individual | Worldwide income | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Non-resident individual | Venezuelan-source income only | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Foreign resident with a fixed base in Venezuela | National- and foreign-source income attributable to that base | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |

### 5.2 The graduated computation (residents)

1. Aggregate worldwide taxable income; convert to UT at the year's UT value (VES 43.00 for 2025).
2. Subtract deductions (standard 774 UT **or** itemized desgravámenes — not both).
3. Apply the Tarifa Nº 1 band: tax (UT) = (rate × taxable UT) − sustraendo.
4. Convert tax to VES (× 43.00).
5. Subtract personal credits (rebajas) in VES.
6. Subtract ISLR withheld and estimated-tax advances paid.
7. Result = amount due (or refund).

### 5.3 Deductions — standard vs itemized

**Standard (desgravamen único): 774 UT/year**, no documentation required. Electing it **blocks** itemized deductions. (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

**Itemized desgravámenes** (Section 3.3): education (taxpayer + children under 26, no age limit for special education); insurance premiums and medical/dental paid to Venezuelan entities; mortgage interest on primary home capped at **1,000 UT/year**; rent on primary/permanent home capped at **800 UT/year**. (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

**Employment expenses: none recognised.** Self-employed business expenses follow corporate-tax rules and offset only business income, not salary. (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

**Loss carryforward:** up to 3 years; annual offset limited to 25% of current-year taxable income; foreign losses offset only foreign-source income. (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

### 5.4 Personal credits (rebajas) — applied after tax is computed

| Credit | Amount | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Taxpayer | 10 UT | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Spouse | 10 UT | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Per dependant (minor; incapacitated; or student under 25) | 10 UT each | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |

At UT = VES 43.00, each 10 UT credit = VES 430.

### 5.5 Non-resident flat rates

Salary/services performed in Venezuela: **34% flat**, withheld at source. Professional non-business activities: **34% on 90% of gross** (effective ~30.6%). (PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.)

### 5.6 Filing and administration

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tax year | Calendar year (wage earners); alternative 12-month period for business-engaged individuals | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Annual return | Declaración definitiva de rentas | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Deadline | **31 March** of the following year — NO extensions; special calendar for contribuyentes especiales | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Spouses | Generally file jointly unless separation criteria met | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Estimated-return threshold (non-employees) | Required only if prior-year income from commercial/professional/leasing activity exceeded **1,500 UT** | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Estimated tax payment | Single payment or 6 equal instalments; bi-weekly advances for non-wage special taxpayers | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |
| Tax ID | RIF — issued by SENIAT, no fee, available online; required to invoice/receive payment | PwC corporate "other taxes", reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |

### 5.7 Withholding on self-employed / professional income (Decreto 1.808)

| Item | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Professional/technical services (resident) | ~10% at source | [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm] secondary payroll/contractor source; confirm against Decreto 1.808 / SENIAT |
| Invalid/missing RIF | Increased withholding rate | PwC / Decreto 1.808 (mechanism) |
| IVA (VAT) on services | 16% standard | PwC, reviewed 12 Jan 2026 |

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The full itemised Decreto 1.808 ISLR withholding percentage table was not retrieved from a primary source this session. The 10% professional-services figure is from a secondary source and must be confirmed against Decreto 1.808 / SENIAT before relying on it.

### 5.8 Social security and parafiscal contributions

Source for the whole table: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, reviewed 12 Jan 2026.

| Regime | Employee | Employer | Base | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Social Security (IVSS / Seguro Social Obligatorio) | 4% | 9% / 10% / 11% (by risk class) | Normal/regular wages | Up to 5 minimum salaries (urban) |
| Unemployment (Régimen Prestacional de Empleo) | 0.5% | 2% | Normal/regular wages | Up to 10 minimum salaries (urban) |
| Housing (FAOV / Ley de Vivienda y Hábitat) | 1% | 2% | Total monthly (integral) salary | No cap |
| Worker training (INCES) | 0.5% (from year-end utilidades) | 2% of total wages | Employee: utilidades; employer: payroll | None |
| LOPCYMAT (workplace risk) | — (employer only) | 0.75% – 10% (risk-dependent) | Total salaries paid | Regulations disputed |

**Employee-side total (on normal wages):** 4% + 0.5% + 1% + 0.5% = **6.0%** (IVSS + unemployment + FAOV + INCES employee shares; note INCES employee share is on utilidades, not normal wages). Verify each base separately before summing — bases differ.

**Minimum-salary reference for caps:** VES 130/month (since 15 March 2022, Decreto 4.653), still cited by PwC. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether caps are administratively indexed to the USD-160 integral income in practice.

### 5.9 Penalties (COT)

**Mechanism (confirmed):** Pecuniary fines stated as a multiple are calculated using the **official exchange rate of the highest-value currency published by the BCV** (effectively USD) at the **date of payment** (COT Art. 91, 2020 reform). Late payment accrues interest at the active market rate × 1.2.

| Infraction | Order of magnitude | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Late filing of a return / withholding declaration | ~100–150× the highest-value-currency rate (ISLR withholding declarations cited at 150×) | Grant Thornton COT schedule; TSJ case law |
| Failure to file declarations (formal duty, COT Art. 103/155) | 150–300× the rate | TSJ decisions |
| Underpayment (material) + interest | Applies in addition | COT |

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The full line-by-line COT penalty table was not extracted from a single primary source this session; mechanism and order of magnitude are confirmed. Parse the Grant Thornton COT PDF in full before quoting exact per-infraction multiples.

## Section 6 — Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Bono vs salary classification

- Non-salary bonos (Cestaticket, Bono contra la Guerra Económica) are excluded from the SS base, severance, aguinaldos, vacations, pensions and largely from the ISLR salary base.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm each credit's legal character before including/excluding from the salary base.
- **Conservative default:** treat ambiguous amounts as salary unless documented as a bono.

### 6.2 Standard vs itemized deduction election

- 774 UT standard requires no documents; itemized may exceed it but needs documentation and (for insurance/medical) payment to Venezuelan entities.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm which election minimises tax and that itemized support exists.

### 6.3 Home/office and mixed-use apportionment

- Only the business-use portion of telecoms, internet and similar mixed costs is deductible against business income.
- **Conservative default:** 0% until a documented business percentage is provided.

### 6.4 Currency and BCV conversion

- USD-denominated income/expenses must be converted at the applicable BCV rate; the rate and date drive both the ISLR figure and any penalty exposure.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the conversion rate and date applied to each foreign-currency line.

### 6.5 Estimated-return obligation

- Required only if prior-year commercial/professional/leasing income exceeded 1,500 UT.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm prior-year activity income against the 1,500 UT threshold.

### 6.6 Self-employed expense deductibility (corporate rules)

- Business expenses follow corporate-tax rules and offset only business income, not salary.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm each expense meets the corporate-deduction test and is matched to business income.

### 6.7 Loss carryforward limits

- 3-year carryforward; annual offset capped at 25% of current-year taxable income; foreign losses offset only foreign income.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm prior-year losses and the 25% annual cap.

### Test Suite

**Test 1 — Standard deduction, top band (PwC sample).**
Input: Resident, gross 20,000 UT, standard 774 UT, married + 2 children, withholding VES 5,300.
Expected: taxable 19,226 UT; tax = (0.34 × 19,226) − 875 = 5,661.84 UT = VES 243,459.12; credits 40 UT = VES 1,720; after credits VES 241,739.12; less VES 5,300 → **due VES 236,439.12**.

**Test 2 — Itemized with rent cap.**
Input: Resident, gross 8,000 UT, documented rent 13,953.49 UT, education 2,000 UT, itemized.
Expected: rent capped at 800 UT; deductions 2,800 UT; taxable 5,200 UT; band 4,000–6,000 (29%, sustraendo 575); tax = (0.29 × 5,200) − 575 = **933 UT = VES 40,119.00** before credits.

**Test 3 — Bottom band.**
Input: Resident, gross 1,500 UT, standard 774 UT.
Expected: taxable 726 UT; band 0–1,000 (6%, sustraendo 0); tax = 0.06 × 726 = **43.56 UT = VES 1,873.08** before credits.

**Test 4 — Non-resident professional fee.**
Input: Non-resident professional fee VES 200,000.
Expected: base 90% = VES 180,000; tax 34% = **VES 61,200** withheld (effective 30.6%).

**Test 5 — Non-resident salary.**
Input: Non-resident, salary for services in Venezuela VES 500,000.
Expected: flat 34% = **VES 170,000** withheld at source.

**Test 6 — Credits at exact band boundary.**
Input: Resident, taxable income exactly 6,000 UT, taxpayer-only credit.
Expected: use 29% band (4,000–6,000): tax = (0.29 × 6,000) − 575 = 1,165 UT; less taxpayer credit 10 UT = 1,155 UT = **VES 49,665.00**. (Confirms band continuity: the 34% band at 6,000 gives (0.34 × 6,000) − 875 = 1,165 UT — identical.)

**Test 7 — Estimated-return threshold.**
Input: Prior-year professional income 1,490 UT.
Expected: below 1,500 UT → **no estimated return required**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER quote a bolívar figure without stating the UT value used (VES 43.00 for 2025) and its source
- NEVER apply a rate basis without confirming residency (worldwide vs Venezuelan-source)
- NEVER combine the standard desgravamen (774 UT) with itemized deductions — they are mutually exclusive
- NEVER exceed the itemized caps: mortgage interest 1,000 UT, rent 800 UT
- NEVER treat the legal minimum wage (VES 130/month) as the economic income floor
- NEVER include non-salary bonos in the salary base without reviewer confirmation
- NEVER treat ISLR withheld (retención) or estimated-tax advances as deductible expenses — they are credits
- NEVER allow employment expenses as a deduction — none are recognised
- NEVER allow self-employed business expenses against salary income — only against business income
- NEVER express COT penalties in UT — they are multiples of the BCV highest-value-currency rate at the date of payment
- NEVER quote the Decreto 1.808 withholding rate or the full COT penalty table as authoritative — both are flagged [RESEARCH GAP]
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated and route to a licensed reviewer
