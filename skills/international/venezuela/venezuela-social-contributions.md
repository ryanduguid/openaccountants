  Use this skill whenever asked about Venezuela social security and payroll contributions (IVSS, Paro Forzoso, FAOV, INCES, LOPCYMAT) for employers or employees. Trigger on phrases like "how much social security do I pay in Venezuela", "IVSS contribution", "Seguro Social Obligatorio", "Paro Forzoso", "régimen prestacional de empleo", "FAOV housing contribution", "INCES training levy", "LOPCYMAT", "aporte patronal", "deducción IVSS", "salario mínimo VES 130", "cestaticket", "bono de guerra", "ISLR withholding on salary", "Venezuela payroll tax", or any question about Venezuelan employer/employee statutory contributions. Also trigger when classifying bank statement transactions that relate to IVSS, FAOV/BANAVIH, INCES, or SENIAT debits from Banco de Venezuela, Banesco, Mercantil, or other Venezuelan banks. CRITICAL: Venezuela's legal minimum wage has been frozen at VES 130 since March 2022 and real pay is delivered through NON-salary bonuses (Cestaticket, Bono de Guerra) that are EXCLUDED from the contribution base — never apply contribution rates to total pay. This skill covers contribution rates and splits, the salary vs. non-salary base distinction, contributory ceilings expressed in minimum salaries, the ISLR personal income tax brackets, the Tax Unit (UT) value, filing deadlines, penalties, bank statement classification, and edge cases. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Venezuelan payroll/social-contribution work.

### CRITICAL Venezuela-specific caveat — read FIRST

The **legal monthly minimum wage (salario mínimo) has been frozen at VES 130 since 15 March 2022** (PwC; CloudPay). Almost all social-security and payroll contributions are legally computed on the **salary** base, which in practice is tiny. Real worker compensation is delivered through **non-salary bonuses** — the *Bono contra la Guerra Económica* ("Bono de Guerra") and the *Cestaticket Socialista* — which the government explicitly classifies as **non-salary** so they are **EXCLUDED** from the contribution base. As of 30 April 2025 the indexed minimum income totalled ~US$160/month (Cestaticket ~$40 + Bono de Guerra ~$120, paid in VES at the BCV rate), while the underlying VES 130 minimum wage is worth only ~US$2.50.

**You MUST account for the salary vs. non-salary distinction. Mechanically applying rates to "total pay" will be wrong.** See Section 5, Rule 1.

### Contribution overview (2025)

Source: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Venezuela, Individual, Other taxes (taxsummaries.pwc.com/venezuela/individual/other-taxes), corroborated by CloudPay (cloudpay.com/payroll-guide/venezuela-payroll-and-benefits-guide).

| Regime | Employer | Employee | Base / Ceiling |
|---|---|---|---|
| **IVSS** — Seguro Social Obligatorio (mandatory social security) | 9% / 10% / 11% (by occupational-risk class) | 4% | Capped at **5 minimum salaries** (urban workers) |
| **Paro Forzoso** — Régimen Prestacional de Empleo (unemployment) | 2% | 0.5% | Capped at **10 minimum salaries** (urban workers) |
| **FAOV** — Régimen Prestacional de Vivienda y Hábitat (housing) | 2% | 1% | Total monthly **integral salary, NO cap** |
| **INCES** — training levy | 2% (on total salaries paid) | 0.5% (on annual *utilidades* profit-share bonus) | No cap |
| **LOPCYMAT** — workplace prevention/safety | 0.75% – 10% (risk-dependent) | none (employer-only) | Total salaries paid; cap interpretation disputed |

Notes:
- The **IVSS** and **Paro Forzoso** ceilings are expressed in *minimum salaries*. With the frozen VES 130 minimum wage, the contributory ceilings are extremely low in absolute terms (IVSS cap = 5 × VES 130 = VES 650/month; Paro Forzoso cap = 10 × VES 130 = VES 1,300/month).
- **FAOV** uses the *integral salary* (salario integral) with **no ceiling** — integral salary includes commissions, gratifications, profit sharing, bonuses, vacation bonus, and shift premiums (PwC).
- IVSS announced contribution-rate administration changes in Feb 2025 (secondary EOR sources, e.g. Rivermate). PwC still reports the classic 4% employee / 9–11% employer split for 2025 — **treat 4% / 9–11% as authoritative**. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm whether the Feb-2025 IVSS administrative change altered the split, against ivss.gob.ve.]

### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown occupational-risk class (IVSS) | Use the **lowest** employer rate 9% for estimates; flag for reviewer to confirm class |
| Unknown LOPCYMAT risk rate | STOP — do not estimate; range is 0.75%–10% and is too wide to default safely. Flag for reviewer |
| Pay described only as "total pay" or "total income" | STOP — split into salary vs. non-salary (Cestaticket / Bono de Guerra) before applying ANY rate |
| Unknown whether bonus is salary or non-salary | Treat Cestaticket and Bono de Guerra as **non-salary (EXCLUDED)**; flag everything else for reviewer |
| Unknown whether worker is "urban" | Assume urban-worker ceilings (5 / 10 minimum salaries); flag for reviewer |
| Unknown UT for a year other than 2025 | STOP — UT changes by Administrative Ruling; do not assume |

## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — the worker's **salary** base (the legally-classified *salario*, NOT total compensation) and whether the payment items are salary or non-salary. Without the salary/non-salary split, STOP.

**Recommended** — occupational-risk class (for IVSS 9/10/11%), LOPCYMAT risk rate, integral-salary components (for FAOV), and the annual *utilidades* profit-share figure (for the INCES employee 0.5%).

**Ideal** — the IVSS/BANAVIH/INCES registration records, the payroll register showing salary vs. non-salary line items, and bank statements showing the monthly statutory debits.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-VE-SC-1 — Salary vs. non-salary split unknown.** *Trigger:* only "total pay" is provided, with no breakdown of salary vs. Cestaticket / Bono de Guerra. *Message:* "Venezuelan contributions are computed on the *salary* base only. The Cestaticket Socialista and Bono contra la Guerra Económica are legally non-salary and are excluded. Applying rates to total pay overstates contributions massively. Provide the salary component before I can compute anything."

**R-VE-SC-2 — LOPCYMAT risk rate unknown.** *Trigger:* LOPCYMAT computation requested without the assigned risk percentage. *Message:* "LOPCYMAT employer contributions range 0.75%–10% depending on the assigned occupational-risk rate (INPSASEL classification). I cannot default across a 13× range. Provide the assigned rate or escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-VE-SC-3 — IVSS Feb-2025 rate-change query.** *Trigger:* client asks whether IVSS rates changed in 2025. *Message:* "Secondary EOR sources reference a Feb-2025 IVSS administrative change, but PwC still reports the 4% employee / 9–11% employer split for 2025. [RESEARCH GAP] This must be confirmed directly against ivss.gob.ve before relying on it. Escalate to a licensed accountant."

**R-VE-SC-4 — Penalty / arrears quantification.** *Trigger:* client asks to quantify contribution arrears or COT penalties. *Message:* "COT penalties are FX-indexed to the BCV highest-value-currency rate and special-taxpayer penalties increase by 200%. Do not estimate arrears or penalties without authority statements. Escalate to a licensed accountant immediately."

**R-VE-SC-5 — Exact SENIAT/IVSS form code as load-bearing.** *Trigger:* output depends on naming the exact 2025 ISLR individual form code. *Message:* "PwC does not name the 2025 individual ISLR form number; historically it has been 'Forma 26', filed via the SENIAT online ISLR portal. [RESEARCH GAP] If the exact form code is load-bearing, confirm directly against seniat.gob.ve."

## Section 3 -- Payment pattern library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier for bank statement transactions related to Venezuelan statutory contributions and taxes. When a transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty/reference as it appears in the bank statement. Statutory contributions and tax payments always EXCLUDE from any revenue/expense VAT (IVA) classification — they are statutory obligations, not business supplies. Amounts are in VES.

### 3.1 IVSS / social-security debits

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IVSS, SEGURO SOCIAL, SEGURO SOCIAL OBLIGATORIO | EXCLUDE — IVSS contribution | Monthly employer + employee IVSS |
| INSTITUTO VENEZOLANO DE LOS SEGUROS SOCIALES | EXCLUDE — IVSS contribution | Full authority name |
| TIUNA, SISTEMA TIUNA | EXCLUDE — IVSS contribution | IVSS online payment system reference |

### 3.2 Other statutory regimes

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| PARO FORZOSO, REGIMEN PRESTACIONAL DE EMPLEO, RPE | EXCLUDE — unemployment (Paro Forzoso) | Employer 2% / employee 0.5% |
| FAOV, BANAVIH, VIVIENDA Y HABITAT, AHORRO HABITACIONAL | EXCLUDE — housing (FAOV) | Employer 2% / employee 1%, integral salary, no cap |
| INCES, INCE | EXCLUDE — training levy | Employer 2% / employee 0.5% on utilidades |
| LOPCYMAT, INPSASEL | EXCLUDE — workplace-safety (LOPCYMAT) | Employer-only 0.75%–10% |

### 3.3 SENIAT / tax payments (NOT social contributions — do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SENIAT | EXCLUDE — tax payment, not a contribution | ISLR, IVA or other SENIAT tax |
| ISLR, IMPUESTO SOBRE LA RENTA | EXCLUDE — income tax | Not a social contribution |
| IVA, IMPUESTO AL VALOR AGREGADO | EXCLUDE — VAT | Not a social contribution |
| RETENCION, RETENCION ISLR | EXCLUDE — withholding tax | Salary/professional-fee withholding |

### 3.4 Salary and non-salary payroll (exclude from contribution classification)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| NOMINA, SUELDO, SALARIO (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — payroll (salary) | Salary base; contributions computed separately |
| CESTATICKET, CESTA TICKET, CESTATICKET SOCIALISTA | EXCLUDE — **non-salary** benefit | NOT in the contribution base |
| BONO DE GUERRA, BONO CONTRA LA GUERRA ECONOMICA | EXCLUDE — **non-salary** benefit | NOT in the contribution base |
| UTILIDADES (outgoing) | EXCLUDE — profit-share bonus | INCES employee 0.5% applies to this figure |

### 3.5 Benefit payments received (not contributions paid)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IVSS PENSION, PENSION DE VEJEZ | EXCLUDE — pension income received | Not a contribution payment |
| PARO FORZOSO PAGO, PRESTACION DESEMPLEO | EXCLUDE — unemployment benefit received | Not a contribution payment |

## Section 4 -- Worked examples

Six bank statement classifications for a hypothetical small employer in Caracas. All amounts in VES. Because the minimum wage is frozen at VES 130, salary-base contributions are tiny in absolute terms; FAOV (no cap, integral salary) is usually the largest line.

> Throughout: the **salary base** used for IVSS/Paro Forzoso is the legally-classified *salario*, which for a minimum-wage worker is VES 130/month, subject to the minimum-salary ceilings. Cestaticket and Bono de Guerra are **excluded**.

### Example 1 — IVSS monthly contribution, single minimum-wage worker

**Input line:**
`05.02.2025 ; IVSS SEGURO SOCIAL OBLIGATORIO ; DEBITO ; ENERO 2025 ; -16,90 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "IVSS / SEGURO SOCIAL OBLIGATORIO" (pattern 3.1). Salary base = VES 130 (minimum wage, below the 5-minimum-salary IVSS ceiling of VES 650). Employer 9% (lowest risk class default) + employee 4% = 13% of VES 130 = **VES 16.90**. Excludes from IVA.

Check: 130 × 0.09 = 11.70 (employer); 130 × 0.04 = 5.20 (employee); 11.70 + 5.20 = **16.90**. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — IVSS contribution (employer VES 11.70 + employee VES 5.20).

### Example 2 — FAOV housing contribution (integral salary, no cap)

**Input line:**
`07.02.2025 ; BANAVIH FAOV AHORRO HABITACIONAL ; DEBITO ; ENERO 2025 ; -3,90 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "BANAVIH / FAOV" (pattern 3.2). FAOV uses the **integral salary** with **no ceiling**: employer 2% + employee 1% = 3%. On a VES 130 integral salary (no other integral components present), 3% × 130 = **VES 3.90**. If integral-salary components (commissions, bonuses classified as salary) existed, the base would be higher.

Check: 130 × 0.02 = 2.60 (employer); 130 × 0.01 = 1.30 (employee); 2.60 + 1.30 = **3.90**. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — FAOV housing contribution (employer VES 2.60 + employee VES 1.30).

### Example 3 — Paro Forzoso (unemployment)

**Input line:**
`07.02.2025 ; PARO FORZOSO REGIMEN PRESTACIONAL EMPLEO ; DEBITO ; ENERO 2025 ; -3,25 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "PARO FORZOSO / RPE" (pattern 3.2). Salary base VES 130 (below the 10-minimum-salary ceiling of VES 1,300). Employer 2% + employee 0.5% = 2.5% × 130 = **VES 3.25**.

Check: 130 × 0.02 = 2.60 (employer); 130 × 0.005 = 0.65 (employee); 2.60 + 0.65 = **3.25**. ✓

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — Paro Forzoso (employer VES 2.60 + employee VES 0.65).

### Example 4 — Cestaticket paid (non-salary, NOT a contribution and NOT in the base)

**Input line:**
`10.02.2025 ; CESTATICKET SOCIALISTA ; DEBITO ; FEBRERO 2025 ; -2.080,00 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "CESTATICKET" (pattern 3.4). This is a **non-salary** benefit paid to the worker. It is the dominant part of real take-home pay (here ~VES 2,080, far above the VES 130 salary), but it is **EXCLUDED from every contribution base**. Do NOT add it to the salary base when computing IVSS/Paro Forzoso/FAOV. It is also not itself a statutory contribution debit.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — non-salary benefit. NOT in any contribution base.

### Example 5 — SENIAT ISLR payment (tax, NOT a social contribution)

**Input line:**
`28.03.2025 ; SENIAT ISLR DECLARACION ANUAL ; DEBITO ; EJERCICIO 2024 ; -45.000,00 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "SENIAT / ISLR" (pattern 3.3). This is an annual income-tax (ISLR) payment, due by **31 March** following the tax year (PwC Tax administration). It is NOT a social-security contribution — do not classify it as IVSS/FAOV/etc.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE — ISLR income tax payment. NOT a social contribution.

### Example 6 — Ambiguous IVSS lump sum (possible arrears/penalty)

**Input line:**
`15.06.2025 ; IVSS ; DEBITO ; AJUSTE/RECARGO ; -1.250,00 ; VES`

**Reasoning:**
Matches "IVSS" (pattern 3.1) but the amount is irregular and the reference says "AJUSTE/RECARGO" (adjustment/surcharge). This may include arrears plus COT-indexed penalties (FX-indexed to the BCV highest-value-currency rate; +200% for special taxpayers). Principal cannot be separated from penalty without an IVSS statement.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE from IVA. Flag for reviewer — request the IVSS breakdown to split contribution principal from penalty.

---

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 rules

These rules apply when payroll data is clear and the salary/non-salary split is available. Apply exactly as written. Source for all rates: PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries — Venezuela (Individual, Other taxes & Tax administration) unless noted.

### Rule 1 — Contributions are computed on the SALARY base, NOT total pay

The Cestaticket Socialista and Bono contra la Guerra Económica are **non-salary** and are **EXCLUDED** from every contribution base (PwC; the government's explicit non-salary classification). Always strip these out before applying any rate. This is the single most important rule for Venezuela.

### Rule 2 — IVSS (Seguro Social Obligatorio)

Employer **9% / 10% / 11%** by occupational-risk class; employee **4%**. Base capped at **5 minimum salaries** (urban workers) = 5 × VES 130 = **VES 650/month** (PwC; CloudPay).

### Rule 3 — Paro Forzoso (Régimen Prestacional de Empleo)

Employer **2%**; employee **0.5%**. Base capped at **10 minimum salaries** (urban workers) = 10 × VES 130 = **VES 1,300/month** (PwC).

### Rule 4 — FAOV (housing) uses integral salary with NO cap

Employer **2%**; employee **1%**. Base = total monthly **integral salary** (commissions, gratifications, profit sharing, bonuses, vacation bonus, shift premiums) — **no ceiling** (PwC). This is usually the largest contribution line for anyone earning above the salary minimum.

### Rule 5 — INCES (training levy)

Employer **2%** on total salaries paid; employee **0.5%** applied to the **annual *utilidades* (profit-share) bonus** — no cap (PwC). The employee component is NOT a monthly salary deduction; it attaches to the utilidades payment.

### Rule 6 — LOPCYMAT (workplace prevention) is employer-only

Employer **0.75%–10%** depending on assigned occupational-risk rate; **no employee contribution** (PwC). Do not default the rate — see R-VE-SC-2.

### Rule 7 — Ceilings are expressed in minimum salaries

IVSS = 5 minimum salaries; Paro Forzoso = 10 minimum salaries. With the frozen VES 130 minimum wage, recompute the absolute cap as (multiple × VES 130) whenever the minimum wage figure is current. If the minimum wage changes, the absolute ceilings move with it.

### Rule 8 — ISLR (personal income tax) is separate from contributions

ISLR is progressive **6%–34%** on a Tax-Unit (TU) basis for residents (worldwide income); non-residents pay flat **34% on 90% of gross** for non-business professional income (PwC, Taxes on personal income). The **UT value for 2025 is VES 43** (SNAT/2025/000048, Gazette 2 June 2025). See Section 10 for the bracket table.

### Rule 9 — ISLR filing deadline is 31 March and cannot be extended

The annual ISLR return is due **31 March** following the calendar tax year; late filing triggers penalties plus interest. Major/"special" taxpayers file on SENIAT-set dates (PwC, Tax administration).

### Rule 10 — Estimated-tax return threshold

An estimated-tax (declaración estimada) return is required if prior-year income from commercial, credit, independent-professional, leasing, or partnership activities exceeded **1,500 TU**. Estimated tax = 75% of the tax computed on 80% of estimated income; payable as a single payment or six equal instalments (PwC, Tax administration). For 2025, 1,500 TU = 1,500 × VES 43 = **VES 64,500**.

---

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 catalogue

When data is ambiguous or client circumstances are unclear, flag these situations for reviewer confirmation.

### T2-1 — Occupational-risk class for IVSS (9% vs 10% vs 11%)

**Trigger:** employer IVSS rate must be applied but the risk class is not documented.
**Issue:** the employer rate is 9%, 10%, or 11% depending on the IVSS-assigned occupational-risk class.
**Action:** flag for reviewer. Use 9% only as a provisional estimate and label it as such.

### T2-2 — LOPCYMAT risk rate (0.75%–10%)

**Trigger:** LOPCYMAT contribution must be computed.
**Issue:** the rate spans a 13× range and is assigned per the INPSASEL classification; the cap interpretation is disputed.
**Action:** flag for reviewer. Do not estimate without the assigned rate.

### T2-3 — Integral-salary composition for FAOV

**Trigger:** worker has commissions, bonuses, or shift premiums that may be salary or non-salary.
**Issue:** FAOV uses the integral salary (no cap), so misclassifying a component changes the base directly. Cestaticket and Bono de Guerra are non-salary; other items require judgement.
**Action:** flag for reviewer to confirm which components are integral salary.

### T2-4 — IVSS Feb-2025 administrative change

**Trigger:** client relies on a 2025 IVSS rate.
**Issue:** secondary EOR sources cite a Feb-2025 IVSS administrative change; PwC still shows 4%/9–11%. [RESEARCH GAP]
**Action:** flag for reviewer to confirm against ivss.gob.ve before filing.

### T2-5 — Special-taxpayer (contribuyente especial) status

**Trigger:** client is or may be a SENIAT-designated special taxpayer.
**Issue:** special taxpayers file ISLR on SENIAT-set dates, may make bi-weekly advance payments, and face penalties increased by 200% (COT Art. 108).
**Action:** flag for reviewer to confirm special-taxpayer designation and the applicable calendar.

### T2-6 — Contribution arrears and FX-indexed penalties

**Trigger:** unpaid contributions or COT penalties.
**Issue:** COT-2020 penalties are FX-indexed to the BCV highest-value-currency rate, not UT-indexed; quantification requires authority statements.
**Action:** do not estimate; escalate to a licensed accountant (see R-VE-SC-4).

## Section 8 -- Bank statement reading guide

### How statutory debits appear on Venezuelan bank statements

**Banco de Venezuela:**
- Description: "IVSS", "SEGURO SOCIAL OBLIGATORIO", "BANAVIH FAOV", "INCES", "SENIAT"
- Timing: monthly (contributions); ISLR annually around March
- Amount: small in VES for salary-base contributions (minimum wage frozen at VES 130)

**Banesco:**
- Description: "IVSS SEGURO SOCIAL", "FAOV AHORRO HABITACIONAL", "PARO FORZOSO", "RETENCION ISLR"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Mercantil / BBVA Provincial / Banco Mercantil:**
- Description: "INSTITUTO VENEZOLANO DE LOS SEGUROS SOCIALES", "BANAVIH", "INCES", "SENIAT"
- Timing: same monthly cycle

**Key identification tips:**
1. Statutory contributions are always outgoing (DEBITO), never credits.
2. Salary-base contributions (IVSS, Paro Forzoso) are tiny in VES because the salary minimum is frozen at VES 130 — do not assume a small debit is an error.
3. FAOV (integral salary, no cap) is usually the largest contribution line for higher earners.
4. **Cestaticket** and **Bono de Guerra** debits are large non-salary payments — they are NOT contributions and NOT in the contribution base.
5. Do not confuse SENIAT (ISLR/IVA tax) debits with IVSS/FAOV/INCES (social contribution) debits.
6. Irregular IVSS/SENIAT lump sums with "RECARGO", "AJUSTE", or "MULTA" may include FX-indexed penalties — flag for reviewer.

---

## Section 9 -- Onboarding fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for statutory debits** — identify all outgoing payments matching Section 3 patterns (IVSS, FAOV/BANAVIH, Paro Forzoso, INCES, LOPCYMAT, SENIAT).
2. **Separate contributions from tax** — IVSS/FAOV/INCES/Paro Forzoso/LOPCYMAT are social contributions; SENIAT/ISLR/IVA are taxes.
3. **Identify the salary base** — look for NOMINA/SUELDO/SALARIO outgoing lines. Treat CESTATICKET and BONO DE GUERRA as non-salary (excluded from the base).
4. **Reverse-check IVSS:** if you can see the salary base, employer+employee IVSS ≈ 13% (9% + 4%) of the capped salary base. A monthly IVSS debit far above 13% of (5 × minimum wage) suggests arrears or a non-default risk class.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Contribution classification derived from bank statement amounts only. Salary vs. non-salary split, occupational-risk class, LOPCYMAT rate, and special-taxpayer status have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing."

## Section 10 -- Reference material

### ISLR personal income tax brackets — residents (2025)

Source: PwC — Venezuela, Individual, Taxes on personal income. Thresholds in Tax Units (TU); **UT = VES 43** for 2025 (SNAT/2025/000048). Tax in TU = (taxable income in TU × rate) − subtraction in TU.

| Taxable income (TU) | Rate | Subtraction (TU) |
|---|---|---|

### Worked ISLR bracket check (for the test suite)

For taxable income of 5,000 TU (falls in the 4,000–6,000 band): tax = 5,000 × 29% − 575 = 1,450 − 575 = **875 TU**. In VES at UT 43: 875 × 43 = **VES 37,625**.

### Test suite

**Test 1 — IVSS, minimum-wage worker.** Salary base VES 130, risk class lowest (9%). Employer = 130 × 9% = VES 11.70; employee = 130 × 4% = VES 5.20; total = **VES 16.90**.

**Test 2 — FAOV, integral salary VES 130.** Employer = 130 × 2% = VES 2.60; employee = 130 × 1% = VES 1.30; total = **VES 3.90**.

**Test 3 — Paro Forzoso, salary base VES 130.** Employer = 130 × 2% = VES 2.60; employee = 130 × 0.5% = VES 0.65; total = **VES 3.25**.

**Test 4 — IVSS ceiling.** Salary base = VES 2,000 (above the 5-minimum-salary cap). Capped base = 5 × 130 = VES 650. Employer (9%) = VES 58.50; employee (4%) = VES 26.00; total = **VES 84.50** (NOT computed on the uncapped VES 2,000).

**Test 5 — Cestaticket exclusion.** Worker receives salary VES 130 + Cestaticket VES 2,080. Contribution base = **VES 130 only**; Cestaticket VES 2,080 is excluded. IVSS total (per Test 1) = VES 16.90.

**Test 6 — INCES employee on utilidades.** Annual utilidades VES 4,000. Employee INCES = 4,000 × 0.5% = **VES 20.00** (attaches to the utilidades payment, not the monthly salary).

**Test 7 — ISLR resident, taxable income 5,000 TU (2025).** Tax = 5,000 × 29% − 575 = **875 TU** = 875 × VES 43 = **VES 37,625**.

**Test 8 — ISLR resident, taxable income 1,000 TU.** Falls at the top of the 6% band: 1,000 × 6% − 0 = **60 TU** = 60 × VES 43 = **VES 2,580**.

**Test 9 — Estimated-tax threshold (2025).** Prior-year qualifying income of VES 70,000 = 70,000 / 43 = 1,627.9 TU > 1,500 TU → estimated-tax return **required**.

**Test 10 — Non-resident professional fee.** Gross VES 100,000 non-business professional income: tax = 34% × (90% × 100,000) = 34% × 90,000 = **VES 30,600** withheld.

### Prohibitions

- NEVER apply contribution rates to total pay — strip out Cestaticket and Bono de Guerra (non-salary) first.
- NEVER assume the minimum wage has changed — it has been frozen at VES 130 since 15 March 2022; confirm before relying on a different figure.
- NEVER default the LOPCYMAT rate — it spans 0.75%–10%; flag for reviewer.
- NEVER apply IVSS/Paro Forzoso rates to an uncapped base — the ceilings are 5 and 10 minimum salaries respectively.
- NEVER use a UT value other than VES 43 for 2025 without an Administrative Ruling reference.
- NEVER conflate SENIAT (ISLR/IVA tax) debits with IVSS/FAOV/INCES (social contribution) debits.
- NEVER quantify arrears or COT penalties without authority statements — they are FX-indexed and special-taxpayer penalties rise 200%.
- NEVER rely on the IVSS Feb-2025 rate-change claim without confirming against ivss.gob.ve [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER cite an exact 2025 ISLR form code as definitive without confirming against seniat.gob.ve [RESEARCH GAP].
- NEVER present contribution or tax figures as definitive — always label as estimated and direct the client to their IVSS/SENIAT statements.
