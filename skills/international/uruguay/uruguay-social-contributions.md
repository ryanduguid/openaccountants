  Use this skill whenever asked about Uruguay social-security (BPS) contributions for employed persons. Trigger on phrases like "BPS contributions", "BPS Uruguay", "Banco de Previsión Social", "aporte jubilatorio", "montepío", "15% BPS", "7.5% patronal", "FONASA Uruguay", "FONASA rate", "FRL", "Fondo de Reconversión Laboral", "FGCL", "social security Uruguay", "aportes a la seguridad social", "employer contribution Uruguay", "tope de cotización", "retirement contribution ceiling", "how much BPS do I pay", "Uruguay social contributions calculation", "Formulario 1102 BPS", or any question about computing the BPS social-security burden (employee and employer shares) for Uruguay-based employees. CRITICAL STRUCTURAL FACT: BPS social contributions (jubilatorio/montepío, FONASA, FRL, FGCL) are SEPARATE from IRPF. IRPF (Impuesto a la Renta de las Personas Físicas, Categoría II) is a distinct DGI progressive income tax expressed in BPC units — it is NOT a social contribution. This skill computes ONLY the BPS contribution layer; IRPF withholding lives in the uruguay-payroll / uruguay-income-tax skills. This skill covers the jubilatorio/montepío rates, the FONASA health matrix (3%–8% by income and dependants), FRL, FGCL, the retirement contribution ceiling, the minimum wage, classification of BPS-related bank transactions, and the boundary with IRPF. ALWAYS read this skill before computing any Uruguay social contribution.

# Uruguay Social Contributions (BPS) Skill v0.1 (Tier 2 — research-verified, reviewer sign-off pending)

> **Tier 2 status.** Every rate, threshold, and value below is sourced to a named authority (BPS, DGI, IMPO) or a Big-4 summary (PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries) or a named advisory (EY Uruguay) and cited inline. It has **not** yet been section-by-section verified by a licensed Uruguayan accountant (contador público). Items marked **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** carry residual uncertainty and must be confirmed against primary sources before reliance.

> **READ THIS FIRST — the single most important structural fact.** This skill computes **BPS social-security contributions only** — the retirement (jubilatorio/montepío), health (FONASA), labour-reconversion (FRL), and labour-credit-guarantee (FGCL) layers. **IRPF (Impuesto a la Renta de las Personas Físicas, Categoría II — rentas de trabajo) is a SEPARATE tax**, administered by **DGI** (not BPS), levied progressively (0%–36%) and expressed in **BPC units**. Do **not** treat IRPF as a social contribution, and do not bundle the two layers into one rate. Almost every Uruguayan threshold is expressed in units of the **BPC** (Base de Prestaciones y Contribuciones); for **2025 the BPC = UYU 6,576/month** (Decreto N° 5/025; BPS Comunicado R 2/2025). Use this single BPC value **consistently** everywhere. See Section 1 and the BPC integrity note below.

> **BPC integrity note (resolving the "115 BPC" confusion).** A prior version of this file conflated the IRPF bracket boundary **115 BPC** with a general monthly contribution threshold, producing a self-contradiction. There is no contradiction: **115 BPC = 115 × 6,576 = UYU 756,240/month**, which is the legitimate top of the IRPF 31% bracket (start of 36%). It is an **IRPF** boundary, not a BPS contribution threshold. The only BPS thresholds that matter in this skill are the **FONASA 2.5 BPC band split** (2.5 × 6,576 = UYU 16,440) and the **retirement ceiling** (UYU 272,564/month). BPC = UYU 6,576 reconciles all of them.

## Section 2 — Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** — monthly **nominal** salary in **UYU**, and the employee's **FONASA family situation** (single / single with children / with spouse without own SNIS cover / with spouse + children). Without these, STOP.

**Recommended** — employer sector (general private vs civil/public organism), pay period (month/year, to confirm FY2025 constants), and number of dependents (for the FONASA band only — child *IRPF* deductions are out of scope here).

**Ideal** — BPS nómina (Formulario 1102), payslip showing the nominal salary and each contribution line, and confirmation of the employer's BPS registration.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-UY-BPS-1 — Currency not UYU.** *Trigger:* salary stated in USD or any non-UYU currency. *Message:* "Uruguay social contributions are computed on the UYU nominal salary. Provide the UYU nominal amount (or the FX basis used). Cannot proceed in another currency."

**R-UY-BPS-2 — FONASA family situation unknown.** *Trigger:* family/dependant status not provided. *Message:* "The employee FONASA rate ranges 3%–8% depending on income band and family situation. Defaulting to single / no dependents and flagging the assumption — confirm before reliance."

**R-UY-BPS-3 — IRPF treated as a contribution.** *Trigger:* user asks to bundle IRPF into the BPS rate or treats IRPF as social security. *Message:* "IRPF is a separate DGI income tax (progressive 0%–36% in BPC units), not a BPS social contribution. This skill computes BPS only. Route IRPF withholding to the uruguay-payroll / uruguay-income-tax skill."

**R-UY-BPS-4 — AFAP franja sub-bands.** *Trigger:* user asks for the split of the 15% retirement between BPS and the private AFAP. *Message:* "The total employee retirement withholding is 15%. The AFAP allocation franja sub-bands within the UYU 272,564 ceiling were not confirmed from a primary BPS source in this research — do not state them as confirmed. Escalate to a licensed Uruguayan accountant."

**R-UY-BPS-5 — Civil/public-organism patronal rate.** *Trigger:* employer is a civil or public organism. *Message:* "Civil/public-organism patronal rates differ from the 7.5% general private-sector rate. Confirm the applicable patronal rate before computing; do not apply 7.5% blindly."

**R-UY-BPS-6 — BPS/DGI penalty amounts.** *Trigger:* request for exact mora/penalty figures. *Message:* "Exact 2025 BPS/DGI penalty percentages were not retrieved from a primary source in this research. Do not state a precise figure as confirmed. Escalate to a licensed Uruguayan accountant."

## Section 3 — FONASA employee rate matrix

Employee FONASA is **3%–8%**, selected by income band and family situation. The band split is **2.5 BPC = UYU 16,440/month** (2.5 × 6,576). (Source: BPS Tasas Fonasa; PwC.)

| Monthly income | Single, no children | Single, with children | With spouse*, no children | With spouse*, with children |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ≤ 2.5 BPC (≤ UYU 16,440) | **3%** | **3%** | **5%** | **5%** |
| > 2.5 BPC (> UYU 16,440) | **4.5%** | **6%** | **6.5%** | **8%** |

\* The spouse rates apply **only** when the spouse does **not** have independent SNIS coverage. "Socios vitalicios" of mutual-aid institutions receive reduced rates (0%–5%) — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact socio-vitalicio rates]**.

- FONASA is **NOT** subject to the retirement ceiling — it applies to the **full** nominal salary (PwC; BPS).
- **Band-split check:** 2.5 × 6,576 = **16,440** ✓ (Self-verified.)

## Section 4 — Contribution rates (Industria y Comercio / general private sector)

(Source: BPS Tasas; BPS Tasas Fonasa; PwC — Other taxes, tax year 2025.)

### 4.1 Employee shares

| Component | Employee rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jubilatorio / montepío (retirement) | **15%** | Nominal salary up to ceiling (Section 4.4) | BPS Tasas; PwC |
| FONASA (health) | **3% / 4.5% / 5% / 6% / 6.5% / 8%** (Section 3) | Full nominal salary | BPS Tasas Fonasa |
| FRL | **0.1%** | Full nominal salary | BPS Tasas; PwC |

**Illustrative employee total (single, no dependents, > 2.5 BPC, below ceiling):** 15 + 4.5 + 0.1 = **19.6%**. *Check:* 15 + 4.5 + 0.1 = **19.6** ✓ (Self-verified.) This total moves with the FONASA band/family situation.

### 4.2 Employer shares

| Component | Employer rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Jubilatorio / montepío (patronal) | **7.5%** | Nominal salary up to ceiling (Section 4.4) | BPS Tasas; PwC |
| FONASA | **5%** flat (+ CCM where applicable) | Full nominal salary | BPS Tasas Fonasa; PwC |
| FRL | **0.1%** | Full nominal salary | BPS Tasas; PwC |
| FGCL (Fondo de Garantía de Créditos Laborales) | **0.025%** | Full nominal salary | BPS Tasas; PwC |

**Employer total (PwC headline):** 7.5 + 5 + 0.1 + 0.025 = **12.625%**, before BSE accident insurance and CCM. *Check:* 7.5 + 5 + 0.1 + 0.025 = **12.625** ✓ (Self-verified.)

> Civil/public organisms use different patronal rates; this skill applies the **general private-sector 7.5%** unless told otherwise (R-UY-BPS-5). Effective employer cost rises with the **CCM (Complemento de Cuota Mutual)** and the activity-specific **BSE (Banco de Seguros del Estado) workplace-accident premium** (mandatory, rate varies by risk class — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]**, no single national rate).

### 4.3 Combined headline burden

| Side | Components | Total |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (single, > 2.5 BPC, below ceiling) | 15% + 4.5% + 0.1% | **19.6%** |
| Employer (general private sector) | 7.5% + 5% + 0.1% + 0.025% | **12.625%** |

*Check:* employee 15 + 4.5 + 0.1 = 19.6 ✓; employer 7.5 + 5 + 0.1 + 0.025 = 12.625 ✓ (Self-verified.)

### 4.4 Retirement contribution ceiling (tope de cotización)

| Item | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Retirement ceiling | Retirement contributions (employee **15%** and employer **7.5%**) apply **only up to UYU 272,564/month** (until 31 Dec 2025); salary above this cap is exempt from retirement contribution | PwC — Other taxes; BPS Topes de cotización |
| FONASA / FRL / FGCL | **NOT** subject to the retirement cap — apply to the **full** nominal salary | PwC; BPS |

### 4.5 AFAP (private pension pillar)

Part of the 15% employee retirement is channelled to a private **AFAP** for workers in the mixed regime, by income franjas within the ceiling. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the 2025 AFAP franja sub-bands were not confirmed from a primary BPS "Valores" page. The **total** 15% employee retirement withholding is unaffected — only its split. Do not publish franja sub-thresholds until verified.

## Section 5 — Payment / bank-statement pattern library (deterministic)

Apply these rules mechanically when classifying BPS-related transactions. Match by case-insensitive substring on the uppercased description. BPS contributions are **statutory obligations**, not business supplies — always EXCLUDE from any IVA (VAT) return. All amounts in UYU.

### 5.1 BPS contribution remittances (employer → State)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BPS`, `BANCO DE PREVISION SOCIAL`, `APORTES BPS` | EXCLUDE — BPS remittance | Employee + employer shares, monthly nómina |
| `MONTEPIO`, `JUBILATORIO`, `APORTE PERSONAL` | EXCLUDE — retirement share | Part of the BPS nómina |
| `FONASA` | EXCLUDE — health-fund contribution | Subject to no retirement ceiling |
| `FRL`, `FONDO DE RECONVERSION` | EXCLUDE — FRL contribution | — |
| `FGCL`, `GARANTIA DE CREDITOS LABORALES` | EXCLUDE — FGCL (employer only) | — |
| `FORMULARIO 1102`, `NOMINA BPS` | EXCLUDE — BPS payroll declaration/payment | — |

### 5.2 IRPF / DGI payments (NOT BPS — do not confuse)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DGI`, `DIRECCION GENERAL IMPOSITIVA` | EXCLUDE — DGI tax, NOT BPS | Separate authority |
| `IRPF`, `RETENCION IRPF` | EXCLUDE — income tax, NOT a social contribution | Section 7 |
| `IRAE`, `IVA`, `IMESI` | EXCLUDE — other DGI taxes | Not social security |

### 5.3 BSE workplace-accident premium

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BSE`, `BANCO DE SEGUROS`, `SEGURO DE ACCIDENTES` | EXCLUDE — BSE premium | Mandatory; rate varies by risk class — research gap (Section 4.2) |

### 5.4 Salary credits (to employees — not a contribution)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SUELDO`, `SALARIO`, `HABERES`, `LIQUIDO` | EXCLUDE — net salary payment | Not a BPS contribution |
| `PAGO NOMINA`, `ACREDITACION SUELDO` | EXCLUDE — net salary payment | Not a BPS contribution |
| `AGUINALDO`, `SAC` | EXCLUDE — 13th salary | BPS/IRPF treatment of aguinaldo flagged — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** |

### 5.5 Benefits received from BPS (not contributions paid)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BPS PENSION`, `JUBILACION`, `PENSION` (incoming) | EXCLUDE — benefit received | Not a contribution paid |
| `SUBSIDIO`, `ASIGNACION FAMILIAR` (incoming) | EXCLUDE — benefit received | Not a contribution paid |

## Section 6 — Worked examples

All figures in UYU, tax year 2025, **general private sector (Industria y Comercio)**. BPC = 6,576; FONASA band split = 16,440; retirement ceiling = 272,564. Unless stated, the employee is **single, no dependents**. Each line reconciles to the cent. **These examples compute the BPS layer only — IRPF (Section 7) is excluded by design.**

### Example A — Minimum wage, nominal UYU 23,604/month

23,604 > 16,440 → FONASA 4.5% (single). Below the retirement ceiling.

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 23,604.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 23,604 | 3,540.60 |
| Employee FONASA | 4.5% × 23,604 | 1,062.18 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 23,604 | 23.60 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 3,540.60 + 1,062.18 + 23.60 | **4,626.38** |
| **Net of BPS** | 23,604 − 4,626.38 | **18,977.62** |
| Employer retirement | 7.5% × 23,604 | 1,770.30 |
| Employer FONASA | 5% × 23,604 | 1,180.20 |
| Employer FRL | 0.1% × 23,604 | 23.60 |
| Employer FGCL | 0.025% × 23,604 | 5.90 |
| **Employer BPS total** | 1,770.30 + 1,180.20 + 23.60 + 5.90 | **2,980.00** |
| **Total employer cost** | 23,604 + 2,980.00 | **26,584.00** |
| **Total BPS remittance** | 4,626.38 + 2,980.00 | **7,606.38** |

### Example B — Below the FONASA band split, nominal UYU 15,000/month

15,000 ≤ 16,440 → FONASA 3% (single).

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 15,000.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 15,000 | 2,250.00 |
| Employee FONASA | 3% × 15,000 | 450.00 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 15,000 | 15.00 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 2,250 + 450 + 15 | **2,715.00** |
| **Net of BPS** | 15,000 − 2,715 | **12,285.00** |
| Employer retirement | 7.5% × 15,000 | 1,125.00 |
| Employer FONASA | 5% × 15,000 | 750.00 |
| Employer FRL | 0.1% × 15,000 | 15.00 |
| Employer FGCL | 0.025% × 15,000 | 3.75 |
| **Employer BPS total** | 1,125 + 750 + 15 + 3.75 | **1,893.75** |
| **Total employer cost** | 15,000 + 1,893.75 | **16,893.75** |

### Example C — Mid-range, nominal UYU 120,000/month, single no dependents

120,000 > 16,440 → FONASA 4.5%. Below the retirement ceiling.

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 120,000.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 120,000 | 18,000.00 |
| Employee FONASA | 4.5% × 120,000 | 5,400.00 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 120,000 | 120.00 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 18,000 + 5,400 + 120 | **23,520.00** |
| **Net of BPS** | 120,000 − 23,520 | **96,480.00** |
| Employer BPS total | 12.625% × 120,000 | 15,150.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | 120,000 + 15,150 | **135,150.00** |
| **Total BPS remittance** | 23,520 + 15,150 | **38,670.00** |

*Employer cross-check:* 7.5% × 120,000 = 9,000; 5% × 120,000 = 6,000; 0.1% × 120,000 = 120; 0.025% × 120,000 = 30 → 9,000 + 6,000 + 120 + 30 = **15,150.00** ✓

### Example D — Nominal UYU 120,000/month, single with 1 minor child

Single with children, > 2.5 BPC → FONASA **6%**. (Child *IRPF* deductions are out of scope — this is the BPS layer only.)

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 120,000.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 120,000 | 18,000.00 |
| Employee FONASA | 6% × 120,000 | 7,200.00 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 120,000 | 120.00 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 18,000 + 7,200 + 120 | **25,320.00** |
| **Net of BPS** | 120,000 − 25,320 | **94,680.00** |
| Employer BPS total | 12.625% × 120,000 | 15,150.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | 120,000 + 15,150 | **135,150.00** |

> Versus Example C (same salary, FONASA 4.5%): the higher FONASA band (6% vs 4.5%) raises the employee BPS by 1.5% × 120,000 = 1,800, reducing net-of-BPS from 96,480.00 to 94,680.00. The employer side is unchanged.

### Example E — Above the retirement ceiling, nominal UYU 300,000/month

300,000 > 272,564 → retirement on 272,564; FONASA/FRL/FGCL on full 300,000. FONASA 4.5% (single).

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 300,000.00 |
| Retirement base (capped) | min(300,000, 272,564) | 272,564.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 272,564 | 40,884.60 |
| Employee FONASA | 4.5% × 300,000 | 13,500.00 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 300,000 | 300.00 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 40,884.60 + 13,500 + 300 | **54,684.60** |
| **Net of BPS** | 300,000 − 54,684.60 | **245,315.40** |
| Employer retirement | 7.5% × 272,564 | 20,442.30 |
| Employer FONASA | 5% × 300,000 | 15,000.00 |
| Employer FRL | 0.1% × 300,000 | 300.00 |
| Employer FGCL | 0.025% × 300,000 | 75.00 |
| **Employer BPS total** | 20,442.30 + 15,000 + 300 + 75 | **35,817.30** |
| **Total employer cost** | 300,000 + 35,817.30 | **335,817.30** |
| **Total BPS remittance** | 54,684.60 + 35,817.30 | **90,501.90** |

### Example F — With spouse (no own SNIS cover) + children, nominal UYU 80,000/month

> 2.5 BPC, spouse without SNIS cover + children → FONASA **8%** (top of the matrix). Below the retirement ceiling.

| Line | Computation | Amount (UYU) |
|---|---|---|
| Nominal salary | — | 80,000.00 |
| Employee retirement | 15% × 80,000 | 12,000.00 |
| Employee FONASA | 8% × 80,000 | 6,400.00 |
| Employee FRL | 0.1% × 80,000 | 80.00 |
| **Employee BPS total** | 12,000 + 6,400 + 80 | **18,480.00** |
| **Net of BPS** | 80,000 − 18,480 | **61,520.00** |
| Employer BPS total | 12.625% × 80,000 | 10,100.00 |
| **Total employer cost** | 80,000 + 10,100 | **90,100.00** |

*Employer cross-check:* 7.5% × 80,000 = 6,000; 5% × 80,000 = 4,000; 0.1% × 80,000 = 80; 0.025% × 80,000 = 20 → 6,000 + 4,000 + 80 + 20 = **10,100.00** ✓

## Section 7 — Boundary with IRPF (separate DGI income tax — NOT a contribution)

**IRPF is not computed by this skill.** It is documented here only so the boundary is unambiguous and so that the "115 BPC" value is correctly understood as an IRPF bracket boundary, never a BPS threshold.

IRPF (Impuesto a la Renta de las Personas Físicas, Categoría II — rentas de trabajo) is a **DGI** progressive income tax in BPC units. BPC = UYU 6,576 (2025). (Source: BPS Comunicado R 2/2025; DGI IRPF Cat. II escalas; PwC.)

| Bracket (BPC) | Desde (UYU/month) | Hasta (UYU/month) | Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Up to 7 BPC | 0 | 46,032 | **0%** (MNIG) |
| Over 7–10 BPC | 46,033 | 65,760 | **10%** |
| Over 10–15 BPC | 65,761 | 98,640 | **15%** |
| Over 15–30 BPC | 98,641 | 197,280 | **24%** |
| Over 30–50 BPC | 197,281 | 328,800 | **25%** |
| Over 50–75 BPC | 328,801 | 493,200 | **27%** |
| Over 75–115 BPC | 493,201 | 756,240 | **31%** |
| Over 115 BPC | 756,241 | — | **36%** |

- **Non-taxable minimum (MNIG) = UYU 46,032/month (7 BPC)** — first peso above is taxed.
- **115 BPC = 115 × 6,576 = UYU 756,240/month** — the top of the 31% bracket / start of 36%. This is the *only* meaning of "115 BPC"; it is an **IRPF** boundary, never a BPS contribution threshold.
- **PwC artifact warning:** PwC's worldwide summary mislabels BPC as "165.50" — a USD currency-conversion artifact, not the BPC. The authoritative value is **UYU 6,576**.
- IRPF deductions are taken as a **credit** at **14%** (annual income ≤ 15 BPC equivalent, ≤ UYU 98,640/month) or **8%** above; child deductions are UYU 10,960/month (disabled child UYU 21,920/month); BPS contributions themselves feed the deductible base. **Compute IRPF in the uruguay-payroll / uruguay-income-tax skill — not here.**
- BPC bracket cross-check (× 12 = PwC annual): 552,384 / 789,120 / 1,183,680 / 2,367,360 / 3,945,600 / 5,918,400 / 9,074,880. ✓ Consistent with BPC 6,576.

## Section 8 — Tier 1 rules (deterministic — apply mechanically)

These rules apply when inputs are clear and complete. Apply exactly as written. All amounts in UYU.

1. BPC (2025) = **UYU 6,576/month**, used consistently everywhere (Decreto N° 5/025; BPS Comunicado R 2/2025).
2. Employee BPS = retirement **15%** + FONASA **3%–8%** (Section 3 matrix) + FRL **0.1%** (BPS Tasas; BPS Tasas Fonasa).
3. Employer BPS (general private) = retirement **7.5%** + FONASA **5%** + FRL **0.1%** + FGCL **0.025%** = **12.625%** before BSE/CCM (BPS Tasas; PwC).
4. FONASA band split = **2.5 BPC = UYU 16,440**. ≤ 16,440 → 3% (single) / 5% (spouse w/o SNIS). > 16,440 → 4.5% / 6% / 6.5% / 8% per family situation (Section 3).
5. Retirement contributions (15% + 7.5%) apply **only up to UYU 272,564/month** (until 31 Dec 2025); salary above is exempt from retirement only.
6. FONASA, FRL, and FGCL are **NOT** capped — they apply to the **full** nominal salary regardless of the retirement ceiling.
7. FGCL is **employer-only** (0.025%); never charge it to the employee.
8. Minimum wage = **UYU 23,604/month** from 1 Jan 2025. A minimum-wage earner still pays full BPS.
9. **IRPF is a separate DGI tax** (Section 7) — never bundle it into the BPS rate; route IRPF to the payroll/income-tax skill.
10. The total employee retirement withholding is 15% regardless of the (unconfirmed) AFAP franja split.
11. All amounts in **UYU ($U)** — never another currency.
12. Total monthly BPS remittance = employee BPS shares + employer BPS shares, declared via Formulario 1102 (nómina BPS).

## Section 9 — Tier 2 catalogue (reviewer judgement required)

These items require a licensed Uruguayan accountant's judgement and/or confirmation against primary sources before reliance.

### T2-UY-1 — AFAP income-franja sub-bands (2025)
**Trigger:** request for the split of the 15% retirement between BPS and the private AFAP. **Issue:** the franja sub-bands within the 272,564 ceiling were not confirmed from a primary BPS "Valores" page (Section 4.5). **Action:** state the total 15%; do not publish sub-thresholds. Flag for reviewer.

### T2-UY-2 — BSE workplace-accident premium
**Trigger:** employer wants total labour cost including accident insurance. **Issue:** the BSE premium varies by activity/risk class; no single national rate (Section 4.2). **Action:** flag as a research gap; do not invent a rate.

### T2-UY-3 — CCM (Complemento de Cuota Mutual)
**Trigger:** employer FONASA cost appears higher than 5%. **Issue:** the CCM can add to employer FONASA cost depending on circumstances. **Action:** flag for reviewer; do not quantify without confirmation.

### T2-UY-4 — Socios vitalicios / mutual-aid reduced FONASA rates
**Trigger:** employee is a "socio vitalicio" of a mutual-aid institution. **Issue:** reduced FONASA rates (0%–5%) apply but exact values were not confirmed (Section 3). **Action:** flag for reviewer.

### T2-UY-5 — Aguinaldo (sueldo anual complementario) treatment
**Trigger:** computing BPS on the 13th salary. **Issue:** aguinaldo BPS treatment was not separately sourced in this pass (Section 5.4). **Action:** flag for reviewer; do not assume exemption or inclusion.

### T2-UY-6 — Civil/public-organism patronal rates
**Trigger:** employer is a civil or public organism. **Issue:** patronal rates differ from the 7.5% general private rate (Section 4.2). **Action:** confirm the applicable rate before computing.

### T2-UY-7 — BPS/DGI penalties
**Trigger:** request for exact mora/penalty amounts. **Issue:** 2025 penalty percentages were not retrieved from a primary source. **Action:** do not state precise figures as confirmed; escalate.

## Section 10 — Excel working paper template

Reproduce this layout in a single worksheet (one column per employee, or one row per employee for a register). All cells in UYU. FY2025 constants: BPC 6,576; FONASA band split 16,440; retirement ceiling 272,564. **This template computes the BPS layer only — IRPF is computed in the payroll/income-tax skill.**

| Row | Label | Formula / source |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Employee name | input |
| 2 | Pay period (month/year) | input |
| 3 | Nominal salary | input |
| 4 | FONASA employee rate (decimal) | input (0.03 / 0.045 / 0.05 / 0.06 / 0.065 / 0.08 per Section 3) |
| 5 | Sector (general private?) | input (Y/N — if N, confirm patronal rate) |
| 6 | Retirement base (capped) | `=MIN(B3,272564)` |
| 7 | Employee retirement | `=B6*0.15` |
| 8 | Employee FONASA | `=B3*B4` |
| 9 | Employee FRL | `=B3*0.001` |
| 10 | **Employee BPS total** | `=B7+B8+B9` |
| 11 | **Net of BPS** | `=B3-B10` |
| 12 | Employer retirement | `=B6*0.075` |
| 13 | Employer FONASA | `=B3*0.05` |
| 14 | Employer FRL | `=B3*0.001` |
| 15 | Employer FGCL | `=B3*0.00025` |
| 16 | **Employer BPS total** | `=B12+B13+B14+B15` |
| 17 | **Total employer cost** | `=B3+B16` |
| 18 | **Total BPS remittance** | `=B10+B16` |

**Cross-check against Example C (nominal 120,000, FONASA 4.5%, single):** row 6 = 120,000; row 7 = 18,000; row 8 = 5,400; row 9 = 120; row 10 = 23,520; row 11 = 96,480; row 16 = 15,150; row 17 = 135,150; row 18 = 38,670. ✓ Matches Example C exactly.

**Cross-check against Example E (nominal 300,000, ceiling bites):** row 6 = 272,564; row 7 = 40,884.60; row 8 = 13,500; row 9 = 300; row 10 = 54,684.60; row 11 = 245,315.40; row 12 = 20,442.30; row 16 = 35,817.30; row 17 = 335,817.30; row 18 = 90,501.90. ✓ Matches Example E exactly.

## Section 11 — Onboarding fallback

If the user has not provided enough to compute BPS, collect in this order:
1. Monthly **nominal** salary in **UYU** — refuse if given in USD or another currency (R-UY-BPS-1).
2. **FONASA family situation** — single / single with children / with spouse (own SNIS cover or not) / spouse + children — selects the FONASA band (Section 3).
3. Employer **sector** — general private (7.5% patronal) or civil/public organism (confirm rate).
4. **Pay period** (month + year) — confirm FY2025 constants (BPC 6,576; ceiling 272,564).
5. Confirm the employer is **registered with BPS**.

If any required input is missing, state what is missing and **do not** fabricate a figure. If asked about IRPF, redirect to the payroll/income-tax skill (Section 7).

## Section 12 — Filing obligations

| Item | Purpose | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Formulario 1102** (nómina BPS) | Declare and pay employee + employer BPS shares | Per BPS monthly calendar — **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact monthly due date]** | BPS |
| IRPF (separate, via DGI) | Withholding remittance + annual declaración jurada | See uruguay-payroll / uruguay-income-tax skill | DGI; EY Uruguay |

- Any dependent worker triggers mandatory **BPS employer registration**; no income floor exempts the employer.
- The IRPF year-end **ajuste anual** and Form 1102/1103 *income-tax* declarations are a **DGI** matter handled in the payroll/income-tax skill — not a BPS contribution obligation.

## Section 13 — Interaction with other skills

| Scenario | Skill to use |
|---|---|
| BPS social contributions only (employee + employer) | **This skill (uruguay-social-contributions.md)** |
| Full payroll incl. IRPF withholding + net pay | uruguay-payroll.md |
| Individual IRPF annual return (Form 1102/1103) | uruguay-income-tax.md |
| Uruguay VAT (IVA) returns | uruguay-iva.md |
| Uruguay corporate income tax (IRAE) | uruguay-corporate-tax.md |

### Key handoff points

- **Social contributions → Payroll:** this skill produces the BPS layer (employee ~19.6% and employer 12.625%). The payroll skill layers **IRPF** on top to reach net pay.
- **Social contributions → Bookkeeping:** the 12.625% employer BPS is an expense; the employee BPS shares are a liability until remitted to BPS via Formulario 1102.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER bundle IRPF into the BPS rate — IRPF is a SEPARATE DGI income tax (progressive 0%–36% in BPC units); this skill computes BPS social contributions only.
- NEVER use any BPC value other than **UYU 6,576** for 2025 — use it consistently for the FONASA band split (16,440) and every BPC-denominated figure.
- NEVER treat "115 BPC" as a BPS contribution threshold — it is an IRPF bracket boundary (756,240 = 115 × 6,576). Confusing the two was the prior file's defect.
- NEVER compute Uruguayan contributions in USD or any non-UYU currency — refuse and ask for the UYU nominal salary.
- NEVER assume the FONASA employee rate — it varies 3%–8% by income band and family situation; ask if unknown.
- NEVER apply retirement contributions (15% / 7.5%) above the UYU 272,564 ceiling, and NEVER cap FONASA/FRL/FGCL — those apply to the full nominal salary.
- NEVER charge FGCL (0.025%) to the employee — it is employer-only.
- NEVER state AFAP franja allocation thresholds as confirmed — they are a research gap (the total 15% employee retirement is unaffected).
- NEVER state exact BSE accident premiums, CCM amounts, socio-vitalicio rates, aguinaldo treatment, or BPS/DGI penalty figures as confirmed — they are research gaps.
- NEVER apply unconfirmed 2026 figures (BPC, ceiling, minimum wage) — use FY2025 values until 2026 values are published.
- NEVER present BPS computations as definitive — label them estimated and direct the user to a licensed Uruguayan accountant (contador público).
