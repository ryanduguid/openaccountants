### IRPF Category II -- Labour Income (Rentas del Trabajo) -- Resident, Individual Filing

Progressive scale, 8 brackets, 0%–36%. Figures = annual UYU, TY2025 (BPC = UYU 6,576).

| Annual taxable income (UYU) | BPC multiple | Rate | Cumulative tax at top of band (UYU) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 552,384 | 0 -- 84 | 0% | 0.00 |
| 552,384 -- 789,120 | 84 -- 120 | 10% | 23,673.60 |
| 789,120 -- 1,183,680 | 120 -- 180 | 15% | 82,857.60 |
| 1,183,680 -- 2,367,360 | 180 -- 360 | 24% | 366,940.80 |
| 2,367,360 -- 3,945,600 | 360 -- 600 | 25% | 761,500.80 |
| 3,945,600 -- 5,918,400 | 600 -- 900 | 27% | 1,294,156.80 |
| 5,918,400 -- 9,074,880 | 900 -- 1,380 | 31% | 2,272,665.60 |
| Over 9,074,880 | > 1,380 | 36% | -- |

Source: PwC Tax Summaries (Uruguay, individual taxes, TY2025); brackets are BPC multiples (84/120/180/360/600/900/1,380 BPC) confirmed against BPC = UYU 6,576 and corroborated by BPS Comunicado R 2/2025. Cumulative figures recomputed band-by-band (see Section 5.1).

### IRPF Category II -- Núcleo Familiar (Family-Unit Filing)

Optional when all members earn ≥ 12 minimum salaries; the lowest non-taxable band roughly doubles.

| Annual taxable income (UYU) | BPC multiple | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| 0 -- 1,104,768 | 0 -- 168 | 0% |
| 1,104,768 -- 1,183,680 | 168 -- 180 | 15% |
| 1,183,680 -- 2,367,360 | 180 -- 360 | 24% |
| 2,367,360 -- 3,945,600 | 360 -- 600 | 25% |
| 3,945,600 -- 5,918,400 | 600 -- 900 | 27% |
| 5,918,400 -- 9,074,880 | 900 -- 1,380 | 31% |
| Over 9,074,880 | > 1,380 | 36% |

Source: PwC Tax Summaries (Uruguay, individual). Note: the 10% band is collapsed in family-unit filing; income above the 0% band enters at 15% then follows the same 24%–36% scale.

### IRPF Category I -- Capital Income (Rentas del Capital)

| Item | Rate |
|---|---|
| General capital income (interest, rents, royalties, capital gains) | 12% flat |
| Certain interest income (specific instruments) | 3% / 5% / 7% (item-specific) |
| Dividends | 7% |

Source: PwC Tax Summaries (Uruguay, individual). The headline rate is a flat 12%; the reduced rates are item-specific exceptions. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm exact instrument lists and conditions for the 3%/5%/7% interest rates against DGI / Título 7.]

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown filing unit (individual vs núcleo familiar) | Individual (Formulario 1102) |
| Unknown residency | STOP -- do not apply resident scale without confirming tax residency |
| Unknown income category | STOP -- Category I (capital) and Category II (labour) use different scales |
| Unknown deduction-credit rate (8% vs 10%) | 8% (higher-income default; less favourable to taxpayer) |
| Unknown dependent-child status | 0 children (no fictitious child deduction) |
| Unknown self-employment regime | IRPF general (servicios personales), NOT monotributo |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- confirmation of tax residency, income category (labour Category II and/or capital Category I), filing unit (individual vs núcleo familiar), and either payroll/recibos de sueldo or a bank statement for the full tax year (CSV, PDF, or pasted text).

**Recommended** -- BPS contribution records (aportes), FONASA family situation, number of dependent children (and disability status), housing rent or mortgage-interest documentation, prior-year IRPF declaración jurada.

**Ideal** -- complete income statement, full BPS aportes detail by month, prior-year Formulario 1102/1103, withholding certificates from employers (retenciones), and any IRNR / foreign-income documentation.

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No income data at all = hard stop. Bank statement without payroll records = proceed with reviewer warning: "This IRPF computation was produced from a bank statement alone. The reviewer must confirm that BPS aportes, FONASA family situation, and the deduction credit are correctly captured, and that nothing belongs to Category I vs Category II in error."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-UY-1 -- Tax residency unknown.** "Residency determines whether the resident IRPF scale or the non-resident IRNR regime applies. This skill cannot compute tax without confirming the client is a Uruguayan tax resident. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-UY-2 -- Non-resident income (IRNR).** "Non-resident taxation under IRNR (general rates 7%–25%; 25% for low/no-tax jurisdiction residents) has different rules and is out of scope. Escalate to a contador público."

**R-UY-3 -- Companies / corporate income (IRAE).** "Corporate and business income under IRAE is a separate tax and is out of scope. This skill covers individuals only. Escalate to a contador público."

**R-UY-4 -- Capital gains on real estate / complex disposals.** "Property and complex capital-gains computations under Category I require specialised analysis. Escalate to a contador público."

**R-UY-5 -- New-resident tax holiday / global mobility.** "Tax-holiday elections for new residents and inbound expat planning are highly fact-specific and subject to proposed 2026 changes. Out of scope. Escalate to a contador público."

**R-UY-6 -- IASS (pension income tax) requested.** "IASS (Impuesto de Asistencia a la Seguridad Social) on pensions/retirement income is a separate tax from IRPF and is out of scope for this skill."

**R-UY-7 -- Arrears / DGI enforcement.** "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to DGI enforcement. Mora and recargos compound and are severe. Do not advise. Escalate to a contador público immediately."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement (Spanish terms common in Uruguayan statements). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules.

### 3.1 Income Patterns (Credits / Créditos)

| Pattern | IRPF Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SUELDO, HABERES, NÓMINA, REMUNERACIÓN, EMPLEADOR [name] | Category II | Labour income | Employee salary -- normally withheld at source |
| HONORARIOS, FACTURA, SERVICIOS PROFESIONALES | Category II | Labour income (servicios personales) | Independent professional fees |
| AGUINALDO, SALARIO VACACIONAL | Category II | Labour income | 13th-salary / holiday salary -- taxable |
| ALQUILER COBRADO, RENTA INMUEBLE | Category I | Capital income (rents) | 12% flat band (Section 1) |
| INTERESES, INTERÉS GANADO | Category I | Capital income (interest) | 12% headline; some instruments 3%/5%/7% |
| DIVIDENDOS, UTILIDADES | Category I | Capital income (dividends) | 7% (Section 1) |
| DEVOLUCIÓN DGI, REINTEGRO IRPF | EXCLUDE | Not income | Prior-year tax refund |
| TRANSFERENCIA PROPIA, CUENTA PROPIA | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer | Not income |

### 3.2 Deductible / Credit Items (Debits feeding the deduction credit)

The Uruguayan IRPF does NOT subtract deductions from the base; allowable deductions are summed and multiplied by the deduction rate (8% or 10%), and that credit reduces gross tax (Section 5.3). Capture these for the credit calculation, not as base reductions.

| Pattern | Category | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| BPS, APORTE JUBILATORIO, MONTEPÍO | Deduction credit | Personal BPS pension contribution | 15% jubilatorio (Section 4) |
| FONASA, APORTE FONASA | Deduction credit | Personal health contribution | Rate depends on income / family (Section 4) |
| FRL, FONDO RECONVERSIÓN LABORAL | Deduction credit | 0.10% employee FRL | Component of personal aportes |
| ALQUILER VIVIENDA, ARRENDAMIENTO (housing) | Deduction credit | 6% of housing rent | Deductible item per DGI (Section 5.3) |
| HIPOTECA, INTERÉS PRÉSTAMO VIVIENDA | Deduction credit | Mortgage interest (capped) | Deductible item, capped |

### 3.3 Non-Deductible / Personal (Debits)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| SUPERMERCADO, TIENDA INGLESA, DISCO, DEVOTO | NOT deductible | Personal groceries |
| MULTA, SANCIÓN, RECARGO | NOT deductible | Fines/penalties |
| IRPF, PAGO DGI, DECLARACIÓN JURADA | NOT deductible | Tax payment is not an expense |
| RETIRO PERSONAL, CAJERO (personal), ATM | NOT deductible | Personal drawings |

### 3.4 Exclusions (Neither Income nor Deduction)

| Pattern | Treatment | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| TRANSFERENCIA ENTRE CUENTAS, CUENTA PROPIA | EXCLUDE | Own-account transfer |
| PRÉSTAMO, CUOTA PRÉSTAMO, AMORTIZACIÓN | EXCLUDE | Loan principal movement |
| IVA, PAGO IVA | EXCLUDE | VAT liability, not income/expense |
| PAGO A CUENTA IRPF, ANTICIPO | Credit against liability | Advance/withholding -- credit, not expense |

### 3.5 Uruguayan Banks -- Statement Format Reference

| Bank | Common Patterns | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BROU (Banco República) | TRANSFERENCIA, DÉBITO, CRÉDITO, SUELDO | PDF/CSV; date format DD/MM/YYYY |
| Itaú Uruguay | TRANSF, DÉBITO AUTOMÁTICO, COMPRA | PDF/CSV; merchant in description |
| Santander Uruguay | TRANSFERENCIA, PAGO, COBRO | PDF; counterparty in description |
| BBVA Uruguay | TRANSF, DÉBITO, ABONO | PDF/CSV |
| Scotiabank Uruguay | TRANSFER, DEBIT, PAYMENT | PDF/CSV; some English labels |
| Prex / Mi Dinero (wallets) | RECARGA, PAGO, TRANSFERENCIA | CSV export; clean counterparty names |

## Section 4 -- BPS Social Security Contributions (Industria y Comercio, dependent workers, 2025)

These are NOT income tax but are deductible items feeding the IRPF deduction credit (Section 5.3) and must be captured.

### 4.1 Jubilatorio (Pension)

| Party | Rate |
|---|---|
| Employee (personal) | 15% |
| Employer (patronal) | 7.5% |

Source: BPS, Tasas de aportación (bps.gub.uy/835/tasas.html).

### 4.2 FONASA (Health) -- Employee Personal Rate

The personal FONASA rate steps up at the 2.5 BPC monthly-income threshold and varies by family situation (whether a spouse without their own SNIS coverage and/or dependent children are covered).

| Monthly income | Family situation | Employee rate |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ 2.5 BPC | single, no children | 3% |
| ≤ 2.5 BPC | single, with children | 3% |
| ≤ 2.5 BPC | with spouse (no SNIS cover), ± children | 5% |
| > 2.5 BPC | single, no children | 4.5% |
| > 2.5 BPC | single, with children | 6% |
| > 2.5 BPC | with spouse, no children | 6.5% |
| > 2.5 BPC | with spouse, with children | 8% |

Employer FONASA: 5% (plus Complemento de Cuota Mutual where applicable).
Source: BPS, Tasas FONASA (bps.gub.uy/10314/tasas-fonasa.html). 2.5 BPC = UYU 16,440/month at BPC 6,576.

### 4.3 Other BPS Funds

| Fund | Employee | Employer |
|---|---|---|
| FRL (Fondo de Reconversión Laboral) | 0.10% | 0.10% |
| FGCL (Fondo de Garantía de Créditos Laborales) | -- | 0.025% |

Source: BPS, Tasas de aportación (bps.gub.uy/835/tasas.html). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the exact FRL employee/employer split and the FGCL 0.025% against the BPS official tasas page; secondary guides vary.]

### 4.4 Approximate Totals (Industria y Comercio)

| Party | Component breakdown | Approx. total |
|---|---|---|
| Employee (personal) | 15% jubilatorio + 3%–8% FONASA + 0.10% FRL | 18.10% – 23.10% |
| Employer (patronal) | 7.5% jubilatorio + 5% FONASA + 0.10% FRL + 0.025% FGCL | 12.625% |

Employee total range arithmetic: minimum = 15 + 3 + 0.10 = 18.10%; maximum = 15 + 8 + 0.10 = 23.10%. Employer total = 7.5 + 5 + 0.10 + 0.025 = 12.625%. Employer figure excludes BSE (accident insurance), which varies by activity. Sources: BPS tasas pages above; aggregation corroborated by secondary calculators (calculame.uy). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm employee FRL inclusion and BSE rate by activity.]

### 4.5 Contribution Ceiling (Tope Jubilatorio) 2025

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Max nominal monthly income subject to jubilatorio | UYU 272,564/month |
| Max personal jubilatorio contribution | UYU 40,885/month |

[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 2025 tope jubilatorio (UYU 272,564 income / UYU 40,885 contribution) against the BPS official ceiling table; this figure was found only in a secondary calculator (misalario.uy) and must be re-verified before reliance.]

### 4.6 Minimum Wage

Salario Mínimo Nacional 2025 = UYU 23,604/month, effective 1 Jan 2025 (+6%). Source: MTSS (gub.uy/ministerio-trabajo-seguridad-social). Used as a reference for the "12 minimum salaries" núcleo-familiar eligibility test.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Category II Progressive Tax -- Cumulative Computation

Tax is computed band-by-band on annual Category II taxable income (after BPS aportes are excluded from the gross to reach the taxable base). Recomputed cumulative tax at each band top (BPC 6,576):

| Band top (UYU) | Band rate | Band width (UYU) | Tax on band (UYU) | Cumulative (UYU) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 552,384 | 0% | 552,384 | 0.00 | 0.00 |
| 789,120 | 10% | 236,736 | 23,673.60 | 23,673.60 |
| 1,183,680 | 15% | 394,560 | 59,184.00 | 82,857.60 |
| 2,367,360 | 24% | 1,183,680 | 284,083.20 | 366,940.80 |
| 3,945,600 | 25% | 1,578,240 | 394,560.00 | 761,500.80 |
| 5,918,400 | 27% | 1,972,800 | 532,656.00 | 1,294,156.80 |
| 9,074,880 | 31% | 3,156,480 | 978,508.80 | 2,272,665.60 |
| above | 36% | -- | -- | -- |

### 5.2 Category I Capital Income

Capital income is taxed separately at a flat 12% (with item-specific 3%/5%/7% interest rates and 7% dividends per Section 1). It is NOT pooled with Category II labour income. Source: PwC Tax Summaries.

### 5.3 The Deduction Credit Mechanic (Key Uruguayan Specificity)

Uruguayan IRPF does NOT subtract deductions from the taxable base. Instead:

1. Sum all allowable deductions (personal BPS, FONASA, FRL, fictitious child deduction, 6% of housing rent, capped mortgage interest).
2. Multiply that sum by the deduction rate: **10%** if annual labour income ≤ the 15 BPC/month equivalent; **8%** if income above that threshold.
3. Subtract the resulting credit from the gross Category II tax (from Section 5.1).

Source: certificadodeingresos.uy (unipersonal guide 2025); corroborated by etti.edu.uy. 15 BPC/month = UYU 98,640/month at BPC 6,576. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the 8%/10% threshold and the exact annual mechanic against DGI; some 2025 payroll guides phrase the monthly mechanic as 14%/8%.]

### 5.4 Deductible Items (for the credit)

| Item | Amount |
|---|---|
| Personal BPS jubilatorio contribution | Actual (15%) |
| FONASA + FRL personal contributions | Actual |
| Fictitious deduction per dependent child | 13 BPC/year (UYU 85,488 at BPC 6,576) |
| Fictitious deduction per disabled child | 26 BPC/year (UYU 170,976 at BPC 6,576) |
| Housing rent | 6% of rent paid |
| Mortgage interest | Capped (see DGI cap) |

Source: certificadodeingresos.uy; etti.edu.uy. Peso conversions are 13 BPC × 6,576 = 85,488 and 26 BPC × 6,576 = 170,976. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the mortgage-interest cap amount against DGI.]

### 5.5 Self-Employed / Independent Regimes

| Regime | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Servicios personales (independent professionals) | IRPF Category II base; BPS computed on 70% of billed income (real); total contribution burden ≈ 29.6%–33.1% of invoicing |
| Unipersonal owner without employees | Minimum fictitious base (ficto) = 11 BPC |
| Monotributo (micro-business simplified) | Replaces most national taxes; e.g. 8% on 1 BPC without medical coverage; replaces IRPF/IVA below revenue caps |

Sources: certificadodeingresos.uy; auren.com/uy; BPS monotributo pages (bps.gub.uy/4659, /10444, /844). [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the unipersonal ficto minimum peso value; the source's UYU 12,094 figure appears to use a prior BPC. At BPC 6,576, 11 BPC = UYU 72,336/year, but the monthly ficto base differs — re-verify against BPS aportes mínimos.]

### 5.6 Non-Resident Income (IRNR) -- Reference Only

General rates 7%–25%; 25% for residents of low/no-tax jurisdictions; technical services 12% or 25%. Out of scope (see R-UY-2). Source: PwC Tax Summaries.

### 5.7 Filing and Payment

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Forms | Formulario 1102 (individual); Formulario 1103 (núcleo familiar) |
| Filing window (FY2024 / 2025) | 7 July -- 28 August 2025, staggered by RUT/CI ending |
| Balance payment | Up to 5 equal monthly instalments; 1st on 29 Aug 2025, 5th by 30 Dec 2025 |
| Pure-wage single-employer earners | Generally NOT required to file -- employer withholds; automatic devolution |

Source: EY UY (May 2025); DGI vencimientos 2025; Montevideo Portal.

### 5.8 Penalties (DGI)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Late filing of a sworn return (contravención) | Fixed fine UYU 870/return (2025); UYU 910/return (2026) -- applies even with zero balance |
| Mora (late payment) | Graduated 5% / 10% / 20% of unpaid tax (20% after ~90 days late) |
| Recargos (interest) | ~1% monthly, capitalised every 4 months; rate set periodically by DGI |

Source (contravención): DGI publicación, Resolución DGI 97/026. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm the mora tiers (5/10/20%) and current recargo rate against the Código Tributario / DGI recargo calculator; the tier breakdown is from a secondary summary (memory.com.uy).]

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Individual vs Núcleo Familiar Election

- Núcleo familiar filing is optional and only beneficial in specific income splits; it doubles the lowest non-taxable band but collapses the 10% bracket.
- Eligibility requires all members to earn ≥ 12 minimum salaries.
- **Conservative default:** individual filing (Formulario 1102) until reviewer models both.
- **Flag for reviewer:** run both computations and elect the lower total.

### 6.2 Deduction-Credit Rate (8% vs 10%)

- The rate depends on whether annual labour income exceeds the 15 BPC/month equivalent.
- **Conservative default:** 8% (less favourable) until income level confirmed.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm the threshold crossing and applicable rate.

### 6.3 FONASA Family Situation

- The personal FONASA rate (3%–8%) depends on income relative to 2.5 BPC and on spouse/child coverage.
- **Conservative default:** confirm family situation before applying any rate above 3%.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm spouse SNIS coverage and number of covered children.

### 6.4 Dependent-Child Fictitious Deduction

- 13 BPC/child/year (26 BPC if disabled), splittable between parents.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm number of children, disability status, and any split with the other parent.

### 6.5 Servicios Personales vs Monotributo vs IRPF

- The optimal regime depends on revenue, whether the client has employees, and revenue caps.
- **Conservative default:** IRPF general (servicios personales).
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm monotributo eligibility against current revenue caps.

### 6.6 Foreign Capital Income (Residents)

- Uruguay's quasi-territorial system taxes certain foreign capital income for residents.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm scope of any foreign interest/dividend income and available foreign-tax credits.

### 6.7 Housing Rent / Mortgage Interest Deduction

- 6% of housing rent and capped mortgage interest feed the deduction credit.
- **Flag for reviewer:** confirm documentation and the mortgage-interest cap.

**Test 2 -- Category II, mid-range (within 15% band).**
Input: Resident, individual, Category II taxable income UYU 1,000,000.
Expected: Cumulative to 789,120 = 23,673.60; plus (1,000,000 − 789,120 = 210,880) × 15% = 31,632.00. Gross tax = 55,305.60.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the resident IRPF scale without confirming tax residency
- NEVER pool Category I (capital) and Category II (labour) income -- they are taxed separately
- NEVER subtract deductions from the IRPF base -- deductions feed a credit (sum × 8% or 10%) against gross tax
- NEVER assume the 10% deduction rate -- default to 8% until the income threshold is confirmed
- NEVER apply a FONASA rate above 3% without confirming income level and family situation
- NEVER apply monotributo without confirming revenue-cap eligibility
- NEVER treat IRNR (non-resident) or IRAE (corporate) income with this skill -- escalate
- NEVER treat a BPS or FONASA payment as a base reduction -- it is a deduction-credit item
- NEVER rely on a [RESEARCH GAP] figure without reviewer confirmation
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated
