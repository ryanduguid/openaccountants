description: Use this skill whenever asked about Maldives (Maldivian) personal/individual income tax for self-employed individuals, sole proprietors, or employees. Trigger on phrases like "how much income tax do I pay in the Maldives", "MIRA", "EWT", "employee withholding tax", "MIRA 601", "income tax return Maldives", "interim payment", "tax-free threshold MVR 720,000", "MVR 60,000 a month", "MRPS", "pension contribution Maldives", "self-employed tax Maldives", "income tax registration threshold", or any question about filing or computing income tax for a self-employed or employed client in the Maldives. Also trigger when preparing or reviewing the individual income tax return or an EWT return, computing the progressive income-tax bands, or advising on interim payments and pension. Despite stale secondary sources that claim "the Maldives has no income tax", the Maldives DOES levy a personal income tax under the Income Tax Act (Law No. 25/2019). This skill covers the progressive income-tax brackets, employee withholding tax (EWT), interim/final filing for the self-employed, registration thresholds, the Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS), GST context, and penalties. ALWAYS read this skill before touching any Maldives income tax work.

## Maldives Income Tax -- Self-Employed Skill v0.1

> **CRITICAL — the Maldives DOES have a personal income tax.** Some secondary aggregators (e.g. TaxAtlas) still state "the Maldives has no personal income tax." That is **WRONG**. The Maldives introduced a personal/individual income tax under the **Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019** (ratified 17 December 2019). Income tax commenced 1 January 2020; taxation of remuneration (employment income) began 1 April 2020. The country has no historical tradition of income tax, which is why stale summaries claim none exists. Treat the **Income Tax Act (Law No. 25/2019)** and the **Maldives Inland Revenue Authority (MIRA)** as the governing authority.

### Individual Income Tax — Annual Brackets (Tax Year 2025)

**Individual Income Tax — Annual Brackets (Tax Year 2025)**  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019)_

| Annual taxable income (MVR) | Rate | Tax within band | Cumulative tax at top of band |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 – 720,000 | 0% | MVR 0 | MVR 0 |
| 720,001 – 1,200,000 | 5.5% | 5.5% × 480,000 = 26,400 | MVR 26,400 |
| 1,200,001 – 1,800,000 | 8% | 8% × 600,000 = 48,000 | MVR 74,400 |
| 1,800,001 – 2,400,000 | 12% | 12% × 600,000 = 72,000 | MVR 146,400 |
| Above 2,400,000 | 15% | — | — |

- **Resident vs non-resident tax base** — Residents are taxed on worldwide income; non-residents / temporary residents are taxed on Maldives-source income only.  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019)_
- **Tax-free threshold** — MVR 720,000 / year (= MVR 60,000 / month). Built into the bracket structure — there is no separate personal allowance.  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019; RCO Lawyers, Current Tax Rates in Maldives)_
- **Tax computation method** — Tax is computed by allocating total taxable income across the bands and applying each marginal rate.

Bracket source: RCO Lawyers (rcolawyers.com/guides/2-current-tax-rates-in-maldives/). Authority page: MIRA (mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ictindividuals). The MVR 720,000 / 5.5% / 8% / 12% / 15% structure is internally consistent with the monthly EWT bands below (annual = monthly × 12), which cross-confirms it.

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** The live MIRA page returns HTTP 403 to automated fetches. The annual bracket figures above come from a Maldives law-firm guide (RCO Lawyers), corroborated by the independently-sourced monthly EWT brackets, but were not read directly off the rendered MIRA page or the Income Tax Act PDF. A human should re-check against the Income Tax Act PDF (mira.gov.mv/Legislations/View/Incometaxact) before relying on the exact statutory bands.

### Employee Withholding Tax (EWT) — Monthly Brackets

**Employee Withholding Tax (EWT) — Monthly Brackets**  _(MIRA, EWT rates and brackets, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ictewt; mira.gov.mv/Guides/View/wt_rates_and_brackets; launch announcement edition.mv/news/15888)_

| Monthly remuneration (MVR) | EWT rate |
| --- | --- |
| 0 – 60,000 | 0% (exempt) |
| 60,000 – 100,000 | 5.5% |
| 100,000 – 150,000 | 8% |
| 150,000 – 200,000 | 12% |
| 200,000+ | 15% |

- **EWT withholding scope** — The employer withholds only on the portion of monthly remuneration above MVR 60,000.
- **EWT form & deadline** — File EWT Return MIRA 601 online via MIRAconnect; due the 15th day of the following month, with payment by the same date. Monthly returns are required for every month once an employer has any EWT obligation, even nil months thereafter.  _(MIRA, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ewtfile; form mira.gov.mv/Forms/View/mira-601-Employee-Withholding-Tax-Return)_

**WARNING — do NOT use Rivermate's EWT table.** Rivermate (rivermate.com/guides/maldives/taxes) publishes a different, conflicting EWT table (5%/10%/15%/20% on MVR 5,000–16,667 monthly bands). It does not match the official Income Tax Act structure and appears fabricated/outdated. Use the 5.5% / 8% / 12% / 15% set above.

### Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS) — Contributions

**Maldives Retirement Pension Scheme (MRPS) — Contributions**  _(Maldives Pension Act; MPAO, pension.gov.mv/en/mrps)_

| Party | Contribution |
| --- | --- |
| Employee | 7% of pensionable wage |
| Employer | 7% of pensionable wage (minimum) |
| **Total** | **14%** |

*Self-check: 7% (employee) + 7% (employer) = 14% total. ✓*

- **Employer election to pay full contribution** — The employer may elect to pay the full 14% without deducting the employee share, but must pay at least 7%.  _(MPAO)_
- **Pensionable wage** — The basic salary stated in the employment contract (definition effective 1 May 2010; set by the Pension Office Board). Allowances are generally excluded.  _(MPAO, old.pension.gov.mv/en/scheme/maldives-retirement-pension-scheme-en)_

**Self-employed contributors:** annual contributions must not exceed the annual mandatory contribution of the highest-paid state employee (effective ceiling). **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** No general statutory floor/ceiling for standard (non-self-employed) employees was found on the official MPAO page.

### Conservative Defaults

**Conservative Defaults**

| Ambiguity | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Unknown residency | STOP — do not pick a tax base without confirming resident vs non-resident/temporary |
| Unknown employment vs self-employment | Treat employment income via EWT; self-employment via the individual return |
| Unknown business-use % (vehicle, phone, home) | 0% deduction |
| Unknown expense category | Not deductible |
| Unknown whether income is Maldives-source (non-resident) | Treat as Maldives-source (taxable) until confirmed |
| Unknown GST registration status | Assume not registered; flag if turnover near MVR 1,000,000 |
| Unknown pensionable wage | Use the contractual basic salary only |

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** — bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) residency status (resident / non-resident / temporary resident) and (b) income type (employment via EWT vs self-employment / sole proprietor).

**Recommended** — all sales invoices, purchase invoices/receipts, EWT statements from employers (for employees), MRPS contribution records, prior-year income tax return or MIRA assessment, GST registration status.

**Ideal** — complete income and expenditure account, asset register, interim payment confirmations, employment income details and EWT already withheld.

**Refusal if minimum is missing — SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This Maldives income tax computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify that all deductions claimed are supported by valid documentation and that the wholly-and-exclusively-for-business test is met."

### Refusal Catalogue

- **R-MV-1 — Residency unknown** — "Residency determines the tax base — residents are taxed on worldwide income, non-residents and temporary residents on Maldives-source income only. This skill cannot compute tax without confirmed residency status. Please confirm before proceeding."
- **R-MV-2 — Companies, partnerships, banks** — "This skill covers individuals (employees, sole proprietors, self-employed) only. Company/business income tax (15% above MVR 500,000; 25% for banks) and partnership returns are out of scope. Escalate to a Maldives-qualified tax practitioner."
- **R-MV-3 — Non-resident withholding tax (NWT)** — "Non-resident withholding tax on dividends, interest, royalties, and management/service fees (typically 5–10%) is a separate regime. Out of scope. Escalate to a qualified practitioner."
- **R-MV-4 — Tourism sector specifics** — "Tourism-sector taxation (TGST at 17% from 1 July 2025, green tax, tourism-specific rules) requires specialised analysis. For income tax it is in scope, but TGST/tourism levies are not. Escalate where tourism-specific levies are involved."
- **R-MV-5 — Arrears / enforcement** — "Client has outstanding tax arrears or is subject to MIRA enforcement. Late-payment penalties (0.05%/day, capped at the greater of twice the tax or MVR 250,000) are severe. Do not advise. Escalate to a qualified practitioner immediately."
- **R-MV-6 — GST return requested** — "This skill covers income tax and EWT only. For Maldives GST (GGST 8% / TGST 17%, MIRA 105/return), use a dedicated GST skill or escalate."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement. If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. Maldivian statements are usually in English (with some Dhivehi terms); amounts are in MVR unless flagged USD (common for tourism / TGST).

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

> All examples use Maldivian Rufiyaa (MVR) and the Tax Year 2025 brackets from Section 1. Amounts are recomputed end-to-end below.

### Example 1 — Self-employed, annual taxable income MVR 1,500,000

**Computation:**
- Band 0–720,000: 0% → MVR 0
- Band 720,001–1,200,000: 5.5% × 480,000 = MVR 26,400
- Band 1,200,001–1,500,000: 8% × 300,000 = MVR 24,000
- **Total income tax = 26,400 + 24,000 = MVR 50,400**

*Self-check: 0 + 26,400 + 24,000 = 50,400. ✓*

### Example 2 — Self-employed, annual taxable income MVR 900,000

**Computation:**
- Band 0–720,000: 0% → MVR 0
- Band 720,001–900,000: 5.5% × 180,000 = MVR 9,900
- **Total income tax = MVR 9,900**

*Self-check: 5.5% × 180,000 = 9,900. ✓*

### Example 3 — Employee, monthly remuneration MVR 120,000 (EWT)

**Input line:**
`28/02/2025 ; BML CREDIT ; EMPLOYER ATOLL CONSULTING PVT LTD ; SALARY FEB ; +116,200.00 ; MVR`

**Reasoning:** Employment income. Employer applies EWT monthly bands (Section 1):
- First MVR 60,000: 0% → MVR 0
- 60,000–100,000 (MVR 40,000 at 5.5%): MVR 2,200
- 100,000–120,000 (MVR 20,000 at 8%): MVR 1,600
- **Monthly EWT withheld = 2,200 + 1,600 = MVR 3,800**

Net salary in this example also reflects MRPS employee 7% on pensionable wage; see Example 6. The credit of MVR 116,200 = MVR 120,000 gross − MVR 3,800 EWT (MRPS handled separately by the employer here).

*Self-check: EWT 0 + 2,200 + 1,600 = 3,800; gross 120,000 − 3,800 = 116,200. ✓*

**Classification:** Employment income (EWT regime). Employer files **MIRA 601** by the 15th of the following month.

### Example 4 — Consulting fee received (self-employed, GST-registered)

**Input line:**
`15/03/2025 ; BML TRANSFER IN ; RESORT HOLDINGS PVT LTD ; INV-2025-007 ; +108,000.00 ; MVR`

**Reasoning:** Self-employment revenue. Client is GST-registered and the MVR 108,000 includes 8% GGST. Net business income = 108,000 ÷ 1.08 = MVR 100,000. GST of MVR 8,000 is a liability to MIRA, excluded from income.

*Self-check: 108,000 ÷ 1.08 = 100,000; 100,000 × 8% = 8,000; 100,000 + 8,000 = 108,000. ✓*

**Classification:** Business income = MVR 100,000. GST MVR 8,000 excluded.

### Example 5 — Software subscription (fully deductible)

**Input line:**
`01/04/2025 ; BML CARD ; ADOBE SYSTEMS ; CREATIVE CLOUD APR ; -462.00 ; MVR`

**Reasoning:** Monthly SaaS subscription, recurring, wholly for business. Fully deductible operating expense.

**Classification:** Deductible business expense = MVR 462.00.

### Example 6 — MRPS pension contribution (basic salary MVR 80,000)

**Input line:**
`05/03/2025 ; BML DD ; MPAO MRPS CONTRIBUTION ; FEB ; -5,600.00 ; MVR`

**Reasoning:** MRPS employee contribution = 7% of pensionable wage (contractual basic salary). 7% × 80,000 = MVR 5,600. The employer separately contributes a matching 7% (MVR 5,600), so total to the scheme is MVR 11,200.

*Self-check: 7% × 80,000 = 5,600 (employee); 7% × 80,000 = 5,600 (employer); total 11,200. ✓*

**Classification:** Pension contribution (MRPS), not a general business expense — treat per Section 5.5.

### Example 7 — Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`15/05/2025 ; BML TRANSFER ; OWN ACCOUNT — SAVINGS ; ; -20,000.00 ; MVR`

**Reasoning:** Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 The Wholly-and-Exclusively Test

- **Wholly-and-exclusively test** — An expense is deductible only if incurred wholly and exclusively in the production of business income. Mixed-use expenses must be apportioned on a reasonable, documented basis. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** the precise allowable-expense and deduction rules in the Income Tax Regulation were not fully captured; review directly.  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019 (and Income Tax Regulation))_

### 5.2 Residency and Source

- **Resident individuals** — Resident individuals: taxed on worldwide income.  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019)_
- **Non-resident / temporary resident individuals** — Non-resident / temporary resident individuals: taxed on Maldives-source income only.
- **Residency confirmation requirement** — Confirm residency before computing — see Refusal R-MV-1.

### 5.3 The Tax-Free Threshold

- **Tax-free threshold** — The first MVR 720,000 of annual taxable income (= MVR 60,000/month) is taxed at 0%. This is built into the bracket structure; there is no separate personal allowance.  _(Income Tax Act, Law No. 25/2019; RCO Lawyers guide)_

### 5.4 Income Tax Registration Thresholds

- **Registration threshold — single payer** — Average monthly gross income over any 12-month period exceeds MVR 60,000 (i.e. > MVR 720,000/year).  _(MIRA FAQ, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/FAQ_IncomeTax)_
- **Registration threshold — multiple payers** — MVR 40,000/month where the person derives remuneration from more than one payer and has not been registered by any of them.  _(MIRA FAQ, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/FAQ_IncomeTax)_

### 5.5 MRPS Pension Contributions

- **MRPS contribution rate** — Employee 7% + employer 7% (minimum) of pensionable wage (contractual basic salary) = 14% total.  _(MPAO, Maldives Pension Act)_
- **Employer paying full contribution** — The employer may pay the full 14% without deducting the employee share but must pay at least 7%.

**[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** whether/how the employee MRPS contribution is deductible against taxable income for income-tax purposes, and the self-employed contribution ceiling mechanics — review the Income Tax Regulation and Pension Act directly.

### 5.6 Employee Withholding Tax (EWT)

- **EWT withholding basis** — Employers withhold EWT on monthly remuneration above MVR 60,000 using the monthly bands (Section 1).  _(MIRA)_
- **MIRA 601 filing** — File MIRA 601 via MIRAconnect by the 15th of the following month, with payment by the same date. Nil returns are required once an EWT obligation has arisen.  _(MIRA, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ewtfile)_
- **EWT as credit for employees** — For employees, EWT already withheld is a credit against the individual's final income tax.

### 5.7 Self-Employed / Business Income — Filing & Payment

**Self-Employed / Business Income — Filing & Payment schedule**  _(RCO Lawyers, Maldives Income Tax; MIRA, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ictindividualshowtofile)_

| Step | Deadline |
| --- | --- |
| First interim payment | 31 July of the tax year |
| Second interim payment | 31 January of the following year |
| Final return + payment (annual reconciliation) | 30 June of the following year |

- **Self-employed filing method** — Self-employed individuals and sole proprietors file the individual income tax return (not EWT). Tax is paid over two interim payments plus a final filing.  _(RCO Lawyers, Maldives Income Tax; MIRA, mira.gov.mv/Pages/View/ictindividualshowtofile)_

### 5.8 Non-Deductible Expenses

**5.8 Non-Deductible Expenses**

| Expense | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Entertainment (client meals) | **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm]** — default to non-deductible until the Income Tax Regulation is checked |

### 5.9 GST Interaction (context)

**5.9 GST Interaction (context)**

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| GST collected on sales (GST-registered) | NOT income — exclude from business income |
| Input GST recovered | NOT an expense — exclude |
| GST not recoverable (unregistered / blocked) | IS an expense — gross is the cost |

- **GST rates and thresholds** — GGST 8%; TGST 17% (increased from 16% effective 1 July 2025, 7th Amendment to the GST Act, Law No. 10/2011, ratified 5 Nov 2024).

Expected: **MVR 0** income tax (entirely within the 0% band).

Input: Resident, annual taxable income MVR 3,000,000.

Expected: 0 (first 60,000) + 5.5% × 40,000 (2,200) + 8% × 20,000 (1,600) = **MVR 3,800** EWT withheld; employer files MIRA 601 by the 15th of the following month.

Input: Basic salary MVR 80,000/month.
Expected: Employee 7% = MVR 5,600; employer 7% = MVR 5,600; total to scheme = **MVR 11,200**.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER state that "the Maldives has no personal income tax" — it does, under the Income Tax Act (Law No. 25/2019)
- NEVER use the Rivermate EWT table (5%/10%/15%/20%) — use the official 5.5% / 8% / 12% / 15% bands
- NEVER compute tax without confirmed residency (resident = worldwide; non-resident = Maldives-source only)
- NEVER assert a capital-allowance rate — it is a RESEARCH GAP; flag for the reviewer
- NEVER include GST collected on sales in business income for GST-registered clients
- NEVER allow income tax itself, fines, penalties, or drawings as a deduction
- NEVER treat MRPS as a general business expense — it is the 7%/7% pension contribution
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive — always label as estimated, pending reviewer sign-off
- NEVER rely on the annual brackets without the human re-check noted in Section 1 (MIRA page is bot-blocked)
