## Section 1 -- Quick Reference

**Section 1 Quick Reference table**

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Country | Republic of Bulgaria |
| Currency | BGN (EUR from 1 Jan 2026 at 1.95583) |
| Headline levers | Freelancer 25% normative deduction → **7.5% effective**; freelancer vs sole-trader vs EOOD; 5% dividend WHT |
| Personal income tax | **10% flat** (per `bulgaria-income-tax.md`) |
| Corporate tax (EOOD) | **10%**; dividend withholding **5%** → ~15% combined on fully-distributed profit |
| Anti-avoidance | Substance over form; freelancer must not be disguised employment |

The Bulgarian headline is the FREELANCER (svobodna profesiya) regime: a registered free-profession gets an automatic 25% "normatively recognised expense" deduction, so only 75% of gross is taxed at 10% → an effective ~7.5% income-tax rate (the lowest in the EU), before contributions.

## Section 2 -- Regime Election (the core decision)

**Regime election comparison table**

| Structure | Income tax | Best when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Freelancer** (svobodna profesiya, self-insured) | 10% on 75% of gross = **7.5% effective** (automatic 25% normative deduction; no need to prove expenses) | Solo professionals/consultants, low real expenses, roughly **< €100–150k/yr**, no employees |
| **Sole trader** (ET, едноличен търговец) | ~**15%** on net profit (with a 5% discount for early filing) | Rarely optimal vs freelancer for solo work |
| **EOOD** (single-member Ltd) | **10% CIT** + **5%** dividend WHT ≈ 15% on distributed profit | Higher volumes, teams, real expenses, liability/credibility; retained profit deferred until distribution |

- **Tipping point between freelancer and EOOD** — The freelancer's flat 7.5% wins for solo work up to roughly €100–150k/yr; above that, or with employees/teams, an EOOD typically nets more (real-expense deduction + retained-profit deferral). Model both around that range.  _(Innovires; NomadTax)_

## Section 3 -- Dividends & Profit Extraction (EOOD)

- **EOOD profit taxation** — EOOD profit: 10% CIT. Retained profit is not taxed again until distributed.
- **Dividend withholding tax** — 5% percent (final withholding on dividends to the owner → ~15% all-in on fully distributed profit)

A modest, deductible manager's contract salary can cover social security while the bulk is taken as low-taxed dividends — but it must be genuine. [RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm minimum manager-remuneration / self-insured base rules.]

## Section 4 -- Deductions & Contributions

**Deductions and contributions table**

| Item | Treatment |
| --- | --- |
| Freelancer normative expense | Automatic 25% of gross — no documentation needed; you cannot *also* deduct real expenses. |
| EOOD real expenses | Genuine business costs deductible against the 10% CIT base. |
| Social & health contributions | Deductible from the PIT base; freelancers/self-insured pay on an elected insurable income between the floor and ceiling (see `bulgaria-social-contributions.md`) — electing the **minimum insurable income** minimises contributions (within the law). |
| Voluntary pension/life | Limited deductible allowances. |

## Section 5 -- Reliefs

**Reliefs table**

| Relief | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Children relief | Annual PIT reduction per child (and enhanced for a disabled child), claimed via the annual return. **[RESEARCH GAP — reviewer to confirm current per-child amounts.]** |
| Early-filing discount | 5% discount for sole traders/individuals who file and pay by the deadline. |
| Personal contributions | Mandatory contributions reduce the taxable base. |

## Section 6 -- Red Lines (do not cross)

- **Disguised employment** — A "freelancer" working for a single client under employer-like control can be reclassified as an employee. AUDIT FLASH POINT.
- **Substance requirement** — An EOOD used purely to convert salary into 5% dividends without genuine business can be challenged.
- **Minimum insurable income vs under-declaring** — Electing the minimum insurable income is legal, but under-declaring real income is not.

## PROHIBITIONS

- **Combining deductions** — NEVER combine the 25% normative deduction with real-expense deductions — it is one or the other.
- **Disguised employment presentation** — NEVER present the freelancer regime for what is really single-client employment.
- **Under-declaring income** — NEVER advise under-declaring income to stay in a low band.
- **Contradicting rates** — NEVER contradict the rates in `bulgaria-income-tax.md` / `bulgaria-social-contributions.md`.
- **Research gap disclaimer** — NEVER present [RESEARCH GAP] figures as confirmed, nor optimisation as definitive advice — route to a licensed Bulgarian tax adviser.
