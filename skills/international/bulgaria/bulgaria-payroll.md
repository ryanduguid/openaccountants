# Bulgaria Payroll Skill v0.1

**Tier 2 — research-verified. Figures below are sourced from the National Revenue Agency (НАП / NRA), the National Social Security Institute (НОИ / NSSI), the Bulgarian Ministry of Economy and Industry, PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries, the European Central Bank, and cross-checked against Big-4-adjacent payroll guides (Leinonen, Lano, Innovires, Eurofast). NOT yet signed off by a licensed Bulgarian accountant (счетоводител) or registered auditor. Treat every computation as an estimate pending professional review. Bulgaria adopts the euro on 1 January 2026 at the irrevocably fixed rate EUR 1 = BGN 1.95583 — this skill carries 2025 BGN figures and shows the EUR equivalents for the changeover.**

| Skill version | 0.1 |

### The single most important Bulgaria facts

> **1. Income tax is a FLAT 10%.** There is no progressive band and no general personal allowance for ordinary salary. The 10% applies to **gross pay minus the employee's own mandatory social and health contributions** -- not to raw gross. (ZDDFL; mi.government.bg)
>
> **2. Contributions are capped.** Both employer and employee social/health contributions stop at the **maximum monthly insurable income** ceiling (BGN 4,130 from 1 Apr 2025 ≈ EUR 2,111.64). Above the ceiling only the 10% income tax continues to apply. (mi.government.bg; PwC)
>
> **3. Work-accident contribution is the only variable.** The Accident at Work and Occupational Disease Fund (TZPB) rate is 0.4%--1.1%, set by the employer's economic-activity risk class, and is paid ENTIRELY by the employer. It is the sole reason the employer/total rate is a band. (PwC)

---

## Section 2 -- Income Tax Withholding (данък върху доходите, ЗДДФЛ)

The employer withholds income tax monthly under PAYE. Bulgaria operates a **single flat rate** with no brackets.

### Flat Income Tax Rate (2025)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Income tax rate on employment income | **10%** (flat) (mi.government.bg) |
| Tax base | Gross monthly pay **minus** the employee's mandatory social security and health contributions (mi.government.bg) |
| General personal allowance | **None** for ordinary employment income (limited reliefs exist for disability and children, claimed via annual reconciliation) (mi.government.bg) |

### FSS-equivalent Computation Method

There are no status categories, no marital-status rate tables, and no cumulative-projection mechanism such as Malta's FSS. The monthly withholding is mechanically simple:

```
PIT_base = gross_remuneration - mandatory_employee_contributions
PIT      = PIT_base x 10%
```

The employer withholds this 10% as **advance** income tax each month and performs an **annual reconciliation** for the employee at year-end. Both the PIT and the contributions are due by the **25th of the following month** (Lano). Remuneration above the insurable-income ceiling still bears 10% PIT on the full (gross minus capped contributions) amount, even though no further contributions accrue above the ceiling.

> **Note on reliefs:** Disability relief and child tax relief reduce the annual base but are claimed at year-end via the employer's annual reconciliation or the individual annual return, not as a monthly per-payslip allowance. Treat ordinary monthly withholding as having no allowance. (mi.government.bg)

---

## Section 3 -- Social Security and Health -- Contribution Tables (2025)

All social and health contributions are computed on **insurable income**, clamped between the monthly minimum and the monthly maximum (cap). The tables below are for an employee **born on/after 1 January 1960** (the common case). Rates per Leinonen, the Ministry of Economy summary, and PwC; the per-fund employer/employee split is cross-verified between Leinonen and mi.government.bg.

### 3.1 Employee born on/after 1 Jan 1960 (the default case)

| Fund (Bulgarian) | Employee | Employer | Total | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension Fund -- state old-age & death (Пенсионен фонд / ДОО) | 6.58% | 8.22% | 14.8% | Leinonen |
| Supplementary mandatory Universal Pension Fund -- 2nd pillar (ДЗПО / УПФ) | 2.2% | 2.8% | 5.0% | mi.government.bg |
| General Disease & Maternity (Общо заболяване и майчинство) | 1.4% | 2.1% | 3.5% | Leinonen |
| Unemployment (Безработица) | 0.4% | 0.6% | 1.0% | Leinonen |
| Accident at Work & Occupational Disease -- TZPB (ТЗПБ) | 0% | 0.4%--1.1% | 0.4%--1.1% | PwC |
| Health Insurance -- NHIF (НЗОК) | 3.2% | 4.8% | 8.0% | PwC |
| **TOTAL** | **13.78%** | **18.92%--19.62%** | **32.70%--33.40%** | PwC |

**Arithmetic check (component rows sum to the TOTAL row):**
- Employee column: 6.58 + 2.2 + 1.4 + 0.4 + 0 + 3.2 = **13.78%** ✓
- Employer column (low TZPB 0.4%): 8.22 + 2.8 + 2.1 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 4.8 = **18.92%** ✓
- Employer column (high TZPB 1.1%): 8.22 + 2.8 + 2.1 + 0.6 + 1.1 + 4.8 = **19.62%** ✓
- Total (low): 13.78 + 18.92 = **32.70%** ✓; Total (high): 13.78 + 19.62 = **33.40%** ✓

The employer/employee split is roughly 60/40 by design. (PwC)

### 3.2 Employee born before 1 Jan 1960

| Fund | Employee | Employer | Total | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension Fund -- state (NO separate 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund) | 8.78% (approx) | 11.02% (approx) | 19.8% | Innovires (cites the 19.8% split as 11.88% / 7.92%) |
| General Disease & Maternity | 1.4% | 2.1% | 3.5% | Leinonen |
| Unemployment | 0.4% | 0.6% | 1.0% | Leinonen |
| Accident at Work & Occupational Disease (TZPB) | 0% | 0.4%--1.1% | 0.4%--1.1% | PwC |
| Health Insurance (NHIF) | 3.2% | 4.8% | 8.0% | PwC |

For persons born before 1960 the pension is **19.8%** to the state Pension Fund and there is **NO** separate 5% Universal Pension Fund (Pillar II) contribution -- it is rolled into the state fund. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm the exact pre-1960 employer/employee split against the KSO; Innovires cites 11.88% / 7.92% within the 19.8%, but this is a secondary source and is not used in the default-case worked examples.]**

### 3.3 Insurable-income floor and ceiling (2025)

| Threshold | 1 Jan -- 31 Mar 2025 | 1 Apr -- 31 Dec 2025 | From 1 Jan 2026 (EUR) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly insurable income (general floor = min wage) | BGN 933 | BGN 1,077 | -- | mi.government.bg |
| Maximum monthly insurable income (cap, all funds) | BGN 3,750 | BGN 4,130 | ≈ EUR 2,111.64 | mi.government.bg / PwC |

Occupation-specific minimum insurance thresholds (минимални осигурителни доходи) may set a **higher** floor per profession than the general minimum wage. (mi.government.bg)

## Section 4 -- Conservative Defaults

When an input is ambiguous, apply the conservative default below and flag it for the reviewer.

| Ambiguity | Conservative default | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Work-accident (TZPB) employer rate unknown | Use **1.1%** (top of band) -> employer 19.62%, combined 33.40% | Avoids under-withholding; the actual 0.4%--1.1% rate is set by economic-activity code (PwC) |
| Employee birth-year / pension scheme unknown | Assume **born on/after 1 Jan 1960** (14.8% pension + 5% Universal Pension Fund) | Pre-1960 employees are now past statutory retirement age; the 19.8% single-fund treatment is increasingly rare |
| Minimum insurable base unclear | Use the higher **occupation-specific** minimum insurance threshold where applicable, otherwise the BGN 1,077 (from 1 Apr 2025) floor | Contributions must be on at least the profession's minimum осигурителен доход, not just the general minimum wage (mi.government.bg) |
| Income above the ceiling | Cap insurable income at **BGN 4,130 / EUR 2,111.64**; income above bears 10% PIT but NO further contributions | The ceiling is a hard cap on all funds (mi.government.bg) |
| Currency for 2026 runs | Convert BGN thresholds at **1.95583** and apply EUR equivalents from 1 Jan 2026 | Euro becomes sole legal tender; dual circulation Jan 2026, BGN cash ends 1 Feb 2026 (ECB) |
| Unknown employment status | Assume employee (employer withholds 13.78% and adds the employer share) | Employment income has no de-minimis threshold; default to the withholding obligation |

> **Note on the default TZPB rate.** Section 3 worked examples use the **low end (0.4%)** to illustrate the minimum employer on-cost, but when the risk class is genuinely unknown for a live run, use 1.1% per the table above. The two figures bracket the employer total at 18.92%--19.62%.

## Section 5 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required inputs

**Minimum viable** -- gross monthly remuneration and confirmation that the worker is an employee (not self-employed). Without a gross figure, STOP.

**Recommended** -- employee birth year (to confirm the 5% 2nd-pillar applies vs the pre-1960 19.8% treatment), the employer's work-accident risk class / economic activity (NACE), and whether any occupation-specific minimum insurable income applies.

**Ideal** -- payslip showing the per-fund split, NRA confirmation of contributions paid, the latest Declaration 1 / Declaration 6 filings, the employee's Art. 62 contract notification, and the FS3-equivalent annual income statement.

### Refusal catalogue

**R-BG-PAY-1 -- Gross figure unknown.** *Trigger:* no gross monthly remuneration provided. *Message:* "A gross monthly remuneration is mandatory. The 10% PIT base is gross minus the employee's contributions, and contributions are a percentage of insurable income clamped between the minimum and maximum thresholds. Cannot proceed without the gross figure."

**R-BG-PAY-2 -- Payroll arrears / late-payment quantification.** *Trigger:* client has unpaid contributions or withheld PIT from prior periods and wants the arrears + interest quantified. *Message:* "Overdue social/health contributions and withheld PIT accrue statutory interest (Bulgarian National Bank base rate + 10 percentage points per annum) plus possible administrative fines. Exact arrears and interest must be confirmed against an NRA statement. Escalate to a Bulgaria-qualified accountant -- do not estimate arrears."

**R-BG-PAY-3 -- Art. 62 non-registration penalty.** *Trigger:* client wants the exact fine for failing to notify an employment contract to the NRA under Labour Code Art. 62. *Message:* "Non-registration of an employment contract is penalised; one secondary source reports EUR 7,500--15,000 per case, and the Labour Code sets higher per-violation fines for repeated breaches, but the exact figure must be confirmed against the Labour Code. **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm.]** Escalate to a Bulgaria-qualified accountant."

**R-BG-PAY-4 -- Cross-border / posted-worker / A1 coverage.** *Trigger:* employee works across EU states, holds an A1 certificate, or is a posted worker. *Message:* "Cross-border social-security coordination (EU Regulation 883/2004, A1 certificates, posted workers) determines which state's contributions apply and is outside the scope of this skill. Escalate to a Bulgaria-qualified accountant."

**R-BG-PAY-5 -- Self-employed / freelancer contributions.** *Trigger:* the worker is self-employed (самоосигуряващо се лице), not an employee. *Message:* "This skill covers EMPLOYED persons (employer withholds PIT + contributions). Self-employed/freelancer contributions (27.8% / 31.3%, paid by the individual, reconciled annually) are covered by `bulgaria-social-contributions.md`. Use that skill instead."

## Section 7 -- Worked Examples

Realistic Sofia-based payroll scenarios for a hypothetical employer. Currency is BGN through 2025 and EUR from 1 Jan 2026. Employees are born after 1959 (so the 2nd pillar applies) and the work-accident class is the 0.4% low end unless stated. Every figure below is recomputed end-to-end.

### Example 1 -- Standard salary below the cap (gross BGN 3,000)

**Input line:**
`25.05.2025 ; НАП ОСИГУРОВКИ 04/2025 ; DEBIT ; ОСИГУРОВКИ + ДДФЛ ; -1,239.66 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BGN 3,000 is below the BGN 4,130 cap, so insurable income = BGN 3,000.
- Employee contributions = 13.78% × 3,000 = **BGN 413.40**
- Employer contributions (0.4% TZPB) = 18.92% × 3,000 = **BGN 567.60**
- PIT base = 3,000 − 413.40 = BGN 2,586.60; PIT = 10% × 2,586.60 = **BGN 258.66**
- **Net pay** = 3,000 − 413.40 − 258.66 = **BGN 2,327.94**
- The combined NRA remittance the employer makes = employee contributions 413.40 + employer contributions 567.60 + PIT 258.66 = **BGN 1,239.66**.

**Classification:** Net wage BGN 2,327.94 to employee; combined contributions + PIT BGN 1,239.66 to NRA by 25 May. Employer-share BGN 567.60 is a deductible payroll on-cost.

### Example 2 -- Minimum-wage employee (gross BGN 1,077)

**Input line:**
`25.06.2025 ; ЗАПЛАТА МАЙ 2025 ; DEBIT ; МИНИМАЛНА РЗ ; -835.73 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BGN 1,077 (the minimum monthly wage / general insurable floor from 1 Apr 2025); below the cap.
- Employee contributions = 13.78% × 1,077 = **BGN 148.41**
- Employer contributions (0.4%) = 18.92% × 1,077 = **BGN 203.77**
- PIT base = 1,077 − 148.41 = BGN 928.59; PIT = 10% × 928.59 = **BGN 92.86**
- **Net pay** = 1,077 − 148.41 − 92.86 = **BGN 835.73**

**Classification:** Net wage BGN 835.73. If the employee's occupation carries a higher minimum insurable threshold, contributions must be recomputed on that higher floor (flag for reviewer).

### Example 3 -- Salary above the cap (gross BGN 6,000)

**Input line:**
`25.07.2025 ; НАП ОСИГУРОВКИ 06/2025 ; DEBIT ; ВИСОКА ЗАПЛАТА ; -1,893.60 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
Gross BGN 6,000 exceeds the BGN 4,130 cap. Contributions are computed only up to BGN 4,130:
- Employee contributions = 13.78% × 4,130 = **BGN 569.11**
- Employer contributions (0.4%) = 18.92% × 4,130 = **BGN 781.40**
- Income above BGN 4,130 (BGN 1,870) bears NO contributions.
- PIT, however, applies to full gross minus the (capped) employee contributions: PIT base = 6,000 − 569.11 = BGN 5,430.89; PIT = 10% × 5,430.89 = **BGN 543.09**
- **Net pay** = 6,000 − 569.11 − 543.09 = **BGN 4,887.80**
- Combined NRA remittance = 569.11 + 781.40 + 543.09 = **BGN 1,893.60**.

**Classification:** Insurable income clamped to BGN 4,130; PIT still on the full base. A high salary does NOT scale contributions proportionally.

### Example 4 -- High-risk employer (1.1% work-accident class, gross BGN 3,000)

**Input line:**
`25.05.2025 ; НАП ОСИГУРОВКИ 04/2025 ; DEBIT ; ТЗПБ КЛАС ВИСОК ; -1,260.66 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
Same employee as Example 1 (gross BGN 3,000) but the employer's economic-activity risk class carries the top 1.1% TZPB rate, so the employer rate is 19.62%.
- Employee contributions = 13.78% × 3,000 = **BGN 413.40** (unchanged -- TZPB is employer-only)
- Employer contributions = 19.62% × 3,000 = **BGN 588.60** (vs BGN 567.60 at 0.4%)
- PIT = **BGN 258.66** (unchanged)
- Combined NRA remittance = 413.40 + 588.60 + 258.66 = **BGN 1,260.66**.

**Classification:** Only the employer cost changes; the employee net pay (BGN 2,327.94) is identical to Example 1.

### Example 5 -- Euro-era payroll after the changeover (gross EUR 1,500, Jan 2026)

**Input line:**
`25.02.2026 ; НАП ОСИГУРОВКИ 01/2026 ; DEBIT ; OSIGUROVKI + DDFL ; -619.83 ; EUR`

**Reasoning:**
From 1 Jan 2026 all amounts are EUR-denominated at the fixed 1.95583 rate. Gross EUR 1,500 is below the EUR 2,111.64 cap.
- Employee contributions = 13.78% × 1,500 = **EUR 206.70**
- Employer contributions (0.4%) = 18.92% × 1,500 = **EUR 283.80**
- PIT base = 1,500 − 206.70 = EUR 1,293.30; PIT = 10% × 1,293.30 = **EUR 129.33**
- **Net pay** = 1,500 − 206.70 − 129.33 = **EUR 1,163.97**
- Combined NRA remittance = 206.70 + 283.80 + 129.33 = **EUR 619.83**.

**Classification:** EUR-denominated; the 2025 ceiling/rates carry over as EUR equivalents. **[RESEARCH GAP -- the 2026 EUR thresholds (max base ≈ EUR 2,111.64, min wage ≈ EUR 620.20) are derived/secondary; reviewer to confirm against the 2026 State Social Insurance Budget Act once published.]**

### Example 6 -- New hire requiring Art. 62 registration

**Input line:**
`02.04.2025 ; НАП УВЕДОМЛЕНИЕ ЧЛ.62 ; INFO ; РЕГИСТРАЦИЯ ТРУДОВ ДОГОВОР ; 0.00 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
This is not a payment but an employment-contract notification. Under Labour Code Art. 62, the employer must notify the NRA of the contract **within 3 days** of conclusion (3 working days for foreign employers), and the employee may only start work after NRA confirmation. Termination is notified within 7 days. (Innovires / Leinonen)

**Classification:** No payroll amount; compliance event. Confirm the Art. 62 notification was filed before the employee's start date; missing registration carries a penalty (see refusal R-BG-PAY-3).

## Section 8 -- Tier 1 Rules (deterministic)

Apply exactly as written when inputs are clear.

### Rule 1 -- Income tax is a flat 10% on net-of-contributions base

```
PIT_base = gross_remuneration - mandatory_employee_contributions
PIT      = PIT_base x 10%
```
No brackets, no monthly personal allowance. (mi.government.bg; PwC)

### Rule 2 -- Contribution formula (employee born after 1959)

```
insurable_income     = clamp(gross_remuneration, minimum_insurable, maximum_insurable)
employee_contribution = insurable_income x 13.78%
employer_contribution = insurable_income x (18.92% .. 19.62%)   # TZPB 0.4%–1.1%
total_contribution    = insurable_income x (32.70% .. 33.40%)
```
Where (1 Apr -- 31 Dec 2025): minimum_insurable = BGN 1,077 (or the higher occupation floor); maximum_insurable = BGN 4,130 = EUR 2,111.64. (mi.government.bg / PwC)

### Rule 3 -- Contributions apply only between the floor and the ceiling

Income above BGN 4,130 / EUR 2,111.64 bears NO social or health contributions; income below the minimum is brought up to the minimum insurable income. (mi.government.bg)

### Rule 4 -- Health insurance is 8% of the same base

Health (NHIF) = 8.0% total, split 4.8% employer / 3.2% employee, on the same insurable-income base. (PwC)

### Rule 5 -- Birth year determines the pension treatment

Born **on/after 1 Jan 1960**: Pension Fund 14.8% (6.58% employee / 8.22% employer) PLUS Universal Pension Fund 5% (2.2% employee / 2.8% employer). Born **before 1 Jan 1960**: state Pension Fund 19.8%, NO separate 2nd pillar. (mi.government.bg; Innovires)

### Rule 6 -- Work-accident contribution is employer-only

The TZPB contribution (0.4%--1.1%, set by the employer's economic-activity risk class) is paid ENTIRELY by the employer and is never withheld from the employee. It is the only reason the employer/total rate is a band. (PwC)

### Rule 7 -- Monthly remittance and deadline

The employer withholds the employee share + advance PIT, adds the employer share, and remits combined social/health contributions AND the 10% PIT to the NRA by the **25th of the month following** the income month, filing Declaration 1 and Declaration 6. (Innovires; Lano)

### Rule 8 -- Forms

| Form | Purpose | Deadline | Source |

### Rule 9 -- Euro changeover (1 Jan 2026)

From 1 Jan 2026 all amounts are EUR-denominated at the fixed irrevocable rate **1.95583 BGN = 1 EUR**; dual circulation runs in January 2026 and BGN cash ends 1 February 2026. The 2025 ceiling BGN 4,130 = EUR 2,111.64. (ECB; Leinonen)

### Rule 10 -- Employer registration / no de-minimis

Any employer paying employment income must register as a contributor with the NRA and withhold PIT + contributions from the **first employee**; there is no de-minimis threshold for employment income. (Innovires)

## Section 9 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (reviewer judgement)

Flag these for reviewer confirmation when data is ambiguous.

### T2-1 -- Work-accident risk class unknown
*Trigger:* employer's NACE / economic-activity risk class not provided. *Issue:* employer total ranges 18.92%--19.62%. *Action:* default to 1.1% for a conservative estimate, flag for the reviewer to confirm against the State Social Insurance Budget Act annex.

### T2-2 -- Employee born before 1960
*Trigger:* employee born before 1 Jan 1960. *Issue:* state Pension Fund is 19.8% with NO 2nd pillar; the per-fund split differs from the headline figures. *Action:* flag for reviewer; do not apply the 2.2%/2.8% 2nd-pillar split. **[RESEARCH GAP -- exact pre-1960 split.]**

### T2-3 -- Occupation-specific minimum insurable income
*Trigger:* employee in a profession with a minimum osiguritelen dohod above the general minimum wage. *Issue:* using the BGN 1,077 floor understates contributions. *Action:* flag for reviewer; apply the higher occupation floor.

### T2-4 -- 2026 EUR thresholds not yet confirmed from the budget
*Trigger:* computation for 2026. *Issue:* the EUR equivalents (max base ≈ EUR 2,111.64, min wage ≈ EUR 620.20, self-employed min base ≈ EUR 550.66) are derived/secondary. *Action:* flag for reviewer; confirm against the 2026 State Social Insurance Budget Act once published. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

### T2-5 -- Dual status (employee who is also self-employed)
*Trigger:* worker is both employed and self-employed. *Issue:* the maximum insurable income ceiling applies across all sources combined. *Action:* flag for reviewer; route the self-employed leg to `bulgaria-social-contributions.md`.

### T2-6 -- Art. 62 registration and penalties
*Trigger:* a new hire, contract amendment, or termination. *Issue:* notification deadlines (3 days / 7 days) and non-registration penalties apply. *Action:* confirm the Art. 62 notification was filed; do not quantify the fine without the Labour Code. **[RESEARCH GAP -- EUR 7,500--15,000 figure is secondary.]**

### T2-7 -- Payroll arrears and interest
*Trigger:* unpaid contributions or PIT from prior periods. *Issue:* statutory interest = BNB base rate + 10pp per annum, plus possible fines. *Action:* do not quantify without an NRA statement; escalate to a qualified accountant. **[RESEARCH GAP -- interest mechanism is from a secondary summary; confirm against the DOPK.]**

## Section 11 -- Bank Statement / Terminology Reading Guide

References commonly appear in Cyrillic; some banks transliterate to Latin. From 1 Jan 2026 amounts are EUR-denominated.

| Bulgarian term | Transliteration | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Заплата | Zaplata | Salary / wage |
| Възнаграждение | Vaznagrazhdenie | Remuneration |
| Осигуровки / Осигурителни вноски | Osigurovki / Osiguritelni vnoski | Social security contributions |
| ДОО (Държавно обществено осигуряване) | DOO | State social insurance |
| УПФ (Универсален пенсионен фонд) | UPF | Universal Pension Fund (2nd pillar) |
| НЗОК (Национална здравноосигурителна каса) | NZOK | National Health Insurance Fund |
| ДДФЛ / ДОД (данък върху доходите) | DDFL / DOD | Personal income tax (10% flat) |
| ТЗПБ | TZPB | Accident at Work & Occupational Disease fund |
| Минимална работна заплата (МРЗ) | MRZ | Minimum wage |
| Минимален осигурителен доход (МОД) | MOD | Minimum insurable income |
| Максимален осигурителен доход | -- | Maximum insurable income (cap) |
| Уведомление по чл. 62 | Uvedomlenie po chl. 62 | Art. 62 employment-contract notification |

**Identification tips:**
1. Contribution/PIT debits are always outgoing (DEBIT) to the NRA; recur monthly around the 25th.
2. A single NRA debit may bundle social + health + the 10% PIT -- split by reference (ОСИГУРОВКИ = contributions; ДДФЛ/ДОД = income tax).
3. Net wage to the employee (ЗАПЛАТА outgoing) is separate from the NRA remittance.
4. Income above the BGN 4,130 / EUR 2,111.64 ceiling produces no additional contribution.
5. Do not confuse outgoing contribution debits with incoming NSSI benefit credits (ПЕНСИЯ pension, ОБЕЗЩЕТЕНИЕ benefit).

---

## Section 12 -- Onboarding Fallback

If the client provides only a bank statement and no other information:

1. **Scan for NRA debits** -- identify all outgoing payments matching Section 6 patterns (НАП / ОСИГУРОВКИ / НЗОК / ДОО / УПФ / ДДФЛ).
2. **Separate contributions from PIT** -- tag ОСИГУРОВКИ/ДОО/НЗОК/УПФ as social/health contributions; tag ДДФЛ/ДОД as the 10% PIT.
3. **Reverse-engineer the base** -- for an employer remittance that excludes PIT, divide the contribution by the combined rate (0.3270 at the 0.4% class, up to 0.3340 at 1.1%) to estimate insurable income; check against the BGN 4,130 / EUR 2,111.64 ceiling. If the implied base equals the ceiling exactly, the employee is at or above the cap.
4. **Match the net wage** -- a ЗАПЛАТА outgoing equals gross minus employee contributions minus PIT.
5. **Flag for reviewer:** "Payroll figures derived from bank statement amounts only. Employment status, birth year, work-accident class, and insurable income have not been independently verified. Reviewer must confirm before filing Declaration 1/6."

### Authorities

- **NRA / НАП** (https://nra.bg) -- collects ALL contributions and PIT.
- **NSSI / НОИ** (https://www.nssi.bg) -- administers social-insurance benefits.
- **NHIF / НЗОК** -- administers health insurance.

### Test suite

**Test 1:** Employee born 1990, gross BGN 1,077 (minimum), 0.4% class. -> Insurable BGN 1,077. Employee 13.78% = BGN 148.41. Employer 18.92% = BGN 203.77. PIT base = 928.59; PIT = BGN 92.86. Net = BGN 835.73.

**Test 2:** Employee born 1990, gross BGN 3,000, 0.4% class. -> Employee = BGN 413.40. Employer = BGN 567.60. PIT base = 2,586.60; PIT = BGN 258.66. Net = BGN 2,327.94.

**Test 3:** Employee born 1990, gross BGN 6,000, 0.4% class. -> Insurable capped at BGN 4,130. Employee = BGN 569.11. Employer = BGN 781.40. PIT base = 5,430.89; PIT = BGN 543.09. Net = BGN 4,887.80. Income above BGN 4,130 bears no contribution.

**Test 4:** Employer at high TZPB class (1.1%), gross BGN 3,000. -> Employer = 19.62% × 3,000 = BGN 588.60 (vs BGN 567.60 at 0.4%). Employee net unchanged at BGN 2,327.94.

**Test 5:** Employee born 1955 (pre-1960). -> State Pension Fund 19.8%, NO 2nd pillar. Flag for reviewer to confirm the pre-1960 split. **[RESEARCH GAP.]**

**Test 6:** 2026 computation, gross EUR 1,500, employee born 1990. -> Ceiling EUR 2,111.64; rates unchanged. Employee 13.78% = EUR 206.70; employer 18.92% = EUR 283.80; PIT base = 1,293.30; PIT = EUR 129.33; net = EUR 1,163.97.

**Test 7:** New hire starting work without an Art. 62 notification filed. -> Compliance breach; employee may only start after NRA confirmation. Flag the penalty exposure (refusal R-BG-PAY-3).

**Test 8:** Worker is self-employed, not an employee. -> Out of scope; route to `bulgaria-social-contributions.md` (27.8% / 31.3%, reconciled annually).

## Section 14 -- Interaction with Other Skills

| Scenario | Skill to Use |
|---|---|
| Employee payroll (10% PIT + contributions) | **This skill (bulgaria-payroll.md)** |
| Self-employed / freelancer contributions | bulgaria-social-contributions.md |
| Individual annual income tax return | bulgaria-income-tax.md |
| Bulgaria VAT returns | bulgaria-vat-return.md |

### Key handoff points

- **Payroll -> Bookkeeping:** Gross wages and employer-share contributions are expenses; employee-share contributions and the 10% PIT are liabilities until remitted to the NRA.
- **Payroll -> Income Tax:** The annual employer income statement feeds the employee's annual reconciliation. Employment income with no other source generally needs no individual return.
- **Payroll -> Social Contributions:** A worker who is both employed and self-employed shares one annual insurable-income ceiling -- reconcile across sources.

---

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the 10% PIT to raw gross -- the base is gross MINUS the employee's mandatory contributions
- NEVER compute contributions on income above the monthly ceiling (BGN 4,130 / EUR 2,111.64) -- the cap is hard
- NEVER tell a high earner that contributions scale with their full salary -- they stop at the ceiling
- NEVER withhold the work-accident (TZPB) contribution from the employee -- it is employer-only
- NEVER apply the 5% Universal Pension Fund (2nd pillar) to a person born before 1960 -- they pay 19.8% to the state Pension Fund with no 2nd pillar
- NEVER use only the general minimum wage as the insurable floor when an occupation-specific minimum is higher
- NEVER conflate the 10% flat PIT with social/health contributions -- they are separate even though both go to the NRA
- NEVER let a new employee start work before the Art. 62 employment-contract notification is confirmed by the NRA
- NEVER miss the 25th-of-following-month deadline for Declaration 1, Declaration 6, and payment -- interest and fines apply
- NEVER treat any contested or unpublished 2026 figure as confirmed -- use the carried-over 2025 EUR equivalents and flag the RESEARCH GAP
- NEVER quantify payroll arrears, interest, or fines without an NRA statement -- escalate to a qualified accountant
- NEVER present payroll computations as definitive -- always label as estimated and direct to a licensed Bulgarian accountant
