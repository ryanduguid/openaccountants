### Tax Rates (2025/2026)

**Bulgaria has a single FLAT personal income tax rate. There are NO progressive brackets.** (PwC, *Taxes on personal income*)

| Income type | Rate | Base | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Individuals -- all income (employment, freelance / other self-employment, rental, capital gains, other) | **10%** | Annual taxable base | PwC, *Taxes on personal income* |
| Sole traders (ET -- едноличен търговец) | **15%** | Taxable profit determined under the Corporate Income Tax Act (income minus expenses plus tax adjustments) | PwC, *Income determination* |
| Dividends and liquidation proceeds | **5%** (final withholding tax) | Gross dividend / liquidation proceeds, Bulgarian and foreign payers | PwC, *Income determination* |

**There is no personal/tax-free allowance band.** The flat 10% applies from the first lev of taxable base. Relief is delivered through normative expense deductions and specific tax reliefs (see Sections 5 and 6), not through a 0% band.

### Normative Expense Deductions (before the 10% PIT, non-ET individuals)

| Activity | Statutory deduction from gross | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Freelancers / general self-employment | **25%** | PwC, *Deductions* |
| Liberal professions, royalties / copyright | **40%** | PwC, *Deductions* |
| Rental income (immovable property) | **10%** | PwC, *Deductions* |
| Registered agricultural producers | **60%** | PwC, *Deductions* |

These are statutory percentages applied automatically -- they are NOT itemised receipts. Sole traders (ET) do NOT use normative deductions; they deduct actual expenses under the Corporate Income Tax Act base.

### Social Security and Health Contribution Rates (2025, employees -- Category III, born after 1959)

Contributions are levied only on **insurable income** between the statutory monthly minimum and maximum (see Thresholds). Persons born after 31 Dec 1959 pay the 1st-pillar state pension (14.8%) PLUS the 5% 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund; the two together make up the pension contribution. (PwC, *Other taxes*; Ministry of Economy)

| Fund | Total rate | Employer | Employee | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pension fund (1st pillar, state DOO) | **14.8%** | 8.22% | 6.58% | Ministry of Economy / PwC, *Other taxes* |
| 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund (born after 1959) | **5.0%** | 2.8% | 2.2% | Ministry of Economy / PwC, *Other taxes* |
| General Sickness & Maternity Fund | **3.5%** | 2.1% | 1.4% | Ministry of Economy |
| Unemployment Fund | **1.0%** | 0.6% | 0.4% | Ministry of Economy |
| Accident at Work & Occupational Disease Fund | **0.4% -- 1.1%** (by risk class) | 0.4%--1.1% | 0% (employer only) | PwC, *Other taxes* |
| Health Insurance (NZOK / NHIF) | **8.0%** | 4.8% | 3.2% | PwC, *Other taxes* |
| **Social security subtotal (excl. health)** | **24.7% -- 25.4%** | 14.12% -- 14.82% | 10.58% | PwC, *Other taxes* |
| **GRAND TOTAL contribution burden (social security + health)** | **32.7% -- 33.4%** | **18.92% -- 19.62%** | **13.78%** | PwC, *Other taxes*; Ministry of Economy |

> **Arithmetic check (per-fund).** Employee column: pension 6.58 + 2nd-pillar 2.2 + sickness/maternity 1.4 + unemployment 0.4 + accident 0 + health 3.2 = **13.78%**. Employer column (low, 0.4% accident): 8.22 + 2.8 + 2.1 + 0.6 + 0.4 + 4.8 = **18.92%**; (high, 1.1% accident) = **19.62%**. Combined total = 13.78 + 18.92 = **32.70%** to 13.78 + 19.62 = **33.40%**. This reconciles with the PwC aggregate (social security 24.7%--25.4% + health 8.0% = 32.7%--33.4%; employer 18.92%--19.62%, employee 13.78%) and matches the sibling **bulgaria-social-contributions** skill. The earlier "27.3%" figure was incorrect: it omitted the 5% 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund from the employee/employer split.

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** The per-fund EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE split within the pension funds (e.g. 1st-pillar 8.22%/6.58%, 2nd-pillar 2.8%/2.2%) is taken from the Ministry of Economy / PwC reconciliation; the precise statutory split should be confirmed against the Social Insurance Code (KSO) Art. 6 and the current Public Social Insurance Budget Act for the specific scenario. The work-accident rate (0.4%--1.1%) is keyed to the employer's economic-activity / NACE risk class in the Budget Act annex.

### Self-Insured Persons (freelancers / self-employed registered as SOL, born after 1959)

Self-insured persons pay ALL contributions themselves on a self-declared insurable income between the statutory min and max, reconciled annually against actual income. They do **NOT** pay unemployment or accident-fund contributions. (PwC, *Other taxes*; Ruskov & Kollegen; innovires)

| Component | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Pension fund (1st pillar, state DOO) | 14.8% | PwC, *Other taxes*; Ruskov & Kollegen |
| 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund (born after 1959) | 5.0% | PwC, *Other taxes*; Ruskov & Kollegen |
| Health insurance (NZOK / NHIF) | 8.0% | PwC, *Other taxes*; Ruskov & Kollegen |
| **Mandatory minimum (pension 14.8 + 2nd pillar 5.0 + health 8.0, maternity opted out)** | **27.8%** | sum (PwC; Ruskov & Kollegen; innovires) |
| General Sickness & Maternity (OPTIONAL) | +3.5% | Ruskov & Kollegen; innovires |
| **With maternity coverage opted in** | **31.3%** | sum |

> **Arithmetic check.** Pension 14.8 + 2nd-pillar 5.0 + health 8.0 = **27.8%** mandatory; + optional maternity 3.5 = **31.3%**. This matches the sibling **bulgaria-social-contributions** skill and Ruskov & Kollegen. The earlier "22.8% / 26.3%" figures were incorrect: they omitted the 5% 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund. Persons born before 1 Jan 1960 are outside the 2nd pillar and instead pay a higher 1st-pillar state pension; the mandatory total nets to the same overall figure -- confirm birth year for the correct fund allocation.

### Conservative Defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown taxpayer category | STOP -- do not apply a rate until you know individual vs sole trader (ET) |
| Unknown freelancer activity type | 25% normative deduction (general self-employment) |
| Unknown employer accident-fund risk class | Use the low-end 0.4% accident rate (employer total 18.92%) and flag the exact NACE-keyed rate for the reviewer (see caveat) |
| Unknown birth year | Assume born after 1959 (2nd-pillar universal pension applies) |
| Unknown maternity-coverage election (self-insured) | Assume maternity NOT elected -- use 27.8% mandatory minimum |
| Unknown insurable-income band period | Use 1 Apr -- 31 Dec 2025 band (min BGN 1,077 / max BGN 4,130) for full-year modelling |
| Unknown VAT registration status | Assume NOT registered (gross = cost) until turnover confirmed |
| Unknown residency | STOP -- residency determines worldwide vs Bulgarian-source scope |

---

## Section 2 -- Required Inputs and Refusal Catalogue

### Required Inputs

**Minimum viable** -- bank statement for the full tax year in CSV, PDF, or pasted text, plus confirmation of (a) taxpayer category (individual/freelancer vs sole trader ET), (b) tax residency (resident vs non-resident), and (c) whether registered as a self-insured person.

**Recommended** -- all sales invoices, freelancer activity type (for the correct normative-deduction %), social-security / health contribution payment records, the declared monthly insurable income, prior-year annual return, VAT registration status.

**Ideal** -- complete income and expenditure records, ET profit-and-loss under the CIT-Act base (if sole trader), quarterly advance-PIT payment confirmations, child-relief documentation, employment income details (if also employed).

**Refusal if minimum is missing -- SOFT WARN.** No bank statement at all = hard stop. Bank statement without invoices = proceed with reviewer warning: "This computation was produced from bank statement alone. The reviewer must verify income completeness, the correct normative-deduction percentage, and the declared insurable-income base."

### Refusal Catalogue

**R-BG-1 -- Taxpayer category unknown.** "The rate depends on category: individuals/freelancers are taxed at 10%; sole traders (ET) at 15% on a CIT-Act profit base. This skill cannot compute tax without knowing the category. Please confirm before proceeding."

**R-BG-2 -- Companies / partnerships.** "This skill covers individuals, freelancers, and sole traders (ET) only. Limited companies (OOD/EOOD/AD) file corporate income tax under ZKPO. Escalate to a Bulgarian tax adviser."

**R-BG-3 -- Non-resident income.** "Non-resident taxation covers Bulgarian-source income only and may engage withholding and treaty rules. Out of scope. Escalate to a Bulgarian tax adviser."

**R-BG-4 -- Capital gains on real estate / securities.** "Specific exemptions and computation rules apply to property and securities disposals. Escalate to a Bulgarian tax adviser."

**R-BG-5 -- Arrears / enforcement.** "Client has outstanding public liabilities or is subject to NRA enforcement. Late-payment interest (BNB base + 10 pp in 2025; ECB rate + 8 pp from 2026) accrues continuously. Do not advise. Escalate immediately."

**R-BG-6 -- VAT return requested.** "This skill covers personal income tax only. For Bulgarian VAT, use the bulgaria-vat-return skill."

**R-BG-7 -- Payroll / contributions run requested.** "For employer payroll processing and contribution remittance, use the bulgaria-payroll and bulgaria-social-contributions skills. This skill covers PIT computation."

## Section 3 -- Transaction Pattern Library

This is the deterministic pre-classifier. When a bank statement transaction matches a pattern below, apply the treatment directly. Do not second-guess. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules in Section 5.

**How to read this table.** Match by case-insensitive substring on the counterparty name or description as it appears in the bank statement (Cyrillic or Latin). If multiple patterns match, use the most specific. If none match, fall through to Tier 1 rules. Amounts are in BGN through 31 Dec 2025 and EUR from 1 Jan 2026 (1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN).

## Section 4 -- Worked Examples

All BGN figures apply through 31 Dec 2025; EUR equivalents (1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN) apply from 1 Jan 2026 (PwC, *Other taxes*; BTA).

### Example 1 -- Freelancer client payment (income)

**Input line:**
`15.03.2025 ; UNICREDIT ПРЕВОД ; STUDIO KREBS EOOD ; ХОНОРАР ФАКТУРА 2025-003 ; +9,600.00 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:**
Freelancer professional fee, not VAT-registered. Full BGN 9,600 is gross business income. The 25% normative deduction is applied later at the annual computation, NOT line by line (PwC, *Deductions*).

**Classification:** Gross business income = BGN 9,600.

### Example 2 -- Annual freelancer computation (Art. 50 return, 10% PIT)

**Inputs:** General freelancer (25% normative deduction), gross annual income BGN 48,000. Self-insured, declares insurable income of BGN 2,000/month (within the BGN 1,077--4,130 Apr--Dec band), with maternity coverage opted in (31.3%).

**Reasoning (PwC, *Deductions* / *Taxes on personal income* / *Other taxes*; Ruskov & Kollegen):**
- Normative deduction 25% = BGN 48,000 x 25% = **BGN 12,000**
- Income after normative deduction = 48,000 - 12,000 = **BGN 36,000**
- Annual insurable base = 2,000 x 12 = BGN 24,000; contributions 31.3% = **BGN 7,512**
- Contributions are deductible from the PIT base: 36,000 - 7,512 = **BGN 28,488** (PIT base)
- PIT at flat 10% = 28,488 x 10% = **BGN 2,848.80**

**If BGN 2,700 advance PIT was paid quarterly:** balance due = 2,848.80 - 2,700 = **BGN 148.80**.

**Classification:** PIT base BGN 28,488; PIT due BGN 2,848.80; balance BGN 148.80.

### Example 3 -- Sole trader (ET) at 15%

**Inputs:** Sole trader (ET), taxable profit under the CIT-Act base (income minus actual expenses plus adjustments) = BGN 50,000.

**Reasoning (PwC, *Income determination*):**
ET profit is taxed at **15%**, NOT 10%, and uses actual expenses (not normative deductions). 50,000 x 15% = **BGN 7,500**.

**Classification:** ET tax = BGN 7,500. Filed/paid 1 March -- 30 June.

### Example 4 -- Dividend (5% final withholding)

**Input line:**
`30.06.2025 ; DSK ПРЕВОД ; ALPHA TECH OOD ; ДИВИДЕНТ ; +20,000.00 ; BGN (net after WHT)`

**Reasoning (PwC, *Income determination*):**
Dividends carry a **5% final withholding tax**. On gross BGN 20,000 the WHT is BGN 1,000 and net received is BGN 19,000. Because the tax is final, the dividend is **EXCLUDED** from the 10% taxable base -- do not tax it again.

**Classification:** 5% WHT = BGN 1,000 (final). Exclude from the 10% annual base.

### Example 5 -- Employee monthly payroll (10% PIT on net base)

**Inputs:** Employee (Category III, born after 1959), gross monthly remuneration BGN 3,000 (within the BGN 1,077--4,130 Apr--Dec insurable band). Employee contribution rate **13.78%** (PwC, *Other taxes*; Ministry of Economy).

**Reasoning (PwC, *Other taxes*; Ministry of Economy):**
The monthly PIT base = gross pay minus mandatory EMPLOYEE social-security and health contributions; the 10% is then applied and withheld by the employer:
- Employee contributions = 3,000 x 13.78% = **BGN 413.40**
- Monthly PIT base = 3,000 - 413.40 = **BGN 2,586.60**
- PIT at 10% = **BGN 258.66**
- Net pay = 3,000 - 413.40 - 258.66 = **BGN 2,327.94**

**Classification:** Monthly PIT withheld BGN 258.66; reconciled by the employer by 31 January. (Employer-side cost adds employer contributions of 18.92%--19.62% per the Section 1 table.)

### Example 6 -- Child tax relief (2 children)

**Inputs:** Individual with 2 dependent children, annual taxable base before relief BGN 30,000.

**Reasoning (PwC, *Deductions*):**
Child relief for two children reduces the annual taxable base by **BGN 12,000**. New base = 30,000 - 12,000 = BGN 18,000. Tax saving = 12,000 x 10% = **BGN 1,200**. (One child = BGN 6,000 reduction; three+ = BGN 18,000; disabled child = BGN 12,000.)

**Classification:** Reduced base BGN 18,000; tax saving BGN 1,200.

### Example 7 -- Internal transfer (exclude)

**Input line:**
`12.05.2025 ; UBB ПРЕВОД ; OWN ACCOUNT - СПЕСТЯВАНИЯ ; ; -5,000.00 ; BGN`

**Reasoning:** Transfer between own accounts. Neither income nor expense. Exclude entirely.

**Classification:** EXCLUDE.

## Section 5 -- Tier 1 Rules (When Data Is Clear)

### 5.1 Flat-Rate Principle

**Legislation:** Personal Income Taxes Act (ZDDFL)

Bulgaria applies a single flat **10%** PIT to virtually all individual income (employment, freelance/other self-employment, rental, capital gains, other), with **no progressive bands and no tax-free allowance** (PwC, *Taxes on personal income*). The two exceptions are sole traders (ET) at **15%** and dividends at **5%** final withholding (PwC, *Income determination*).

### 5.2 Normative Expense Deductions (non-ET individuals)

**Legislation:** ZDDFL (PwC, *Deductions*)

Freelancers and self-employed individuals (non-ET) deduct a STATUTORY normative percentage from gross income BEFORE the 10% PIT -- they do not itemise receipts:

| Activity | Normative deduction |
|---|---|
| General freelance / self-employment | 25% |
| Liberal professions, royalties / copyright | 40% |
| Rental income (immovable property) | 10% |
| Registered agricultural producers | 60% |

### 5.3 Sole Trader (ET) Base

**Legislation:** ZDDFL referring to the Corporate Income Tax Act (ZKPO) (PwC, *Income determination*)

Sole traders compute taxable profit under the CIT-Act base (income minus ACTUAL expenses plus tax adjustments) and pay **15%**. They do NOT use normative deductions and file/pay 1 March -- 30 June.

### 5.4 Contributions Reduce the PIT Base

**Legislation:** ZDDFL; Social Insurance Code (KSO); Health Insurance Act (ZZO)

For employees, the monthly PIT base = gross pay minus mandatory EMPLOYEE social-security and health contributions, and the 10% is withheld monthly with an annual reconciliation by 31 January (Ministry of Economy). For self-insured persons, contributions actually paid are deductible from the annual PIT base.

### 5.5 Insurable-Income Bands

**Legislation:** Public Social Insurance Budget Act; KSO

Contributions apply ONLY between the statutory minimum and maximum monthly insurable income:

| Band (2025) | 1 Jan -- 31 Mar | 1 Apr -- 31 Dec | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum monthly insurable income (employees) | BGN 933 (EUR 477.04) | BGN 1,077 (EUR 550.66) | Eurofast |
| Maximum monthly insurable income (cap) | BGN 3,750 (EUR 1,917.34) | BGN 4,130 (EUR 2,111.64) | PwC, *Other taxes* |
| Self-employed minimum base | -- | BGN 1,077 (EUR 550.66) | PwC, *Other taxes* |
| Self-employed maximum base | -- | BGN 4,130 (EUR 2,111.64) | PwC, *Other taxes* |

From 1 Jan 2026: maximum monthly insurable income **EUR 2,111.64**, self-employed minimum **EUR 550.66** (PwC, *Other taxes*).

### 5.6 Dividends

**Legislation:** ZDDFL (PwC, *Income determination*)

Dividends and liquidation proceeds (Bulgarian and foreign payers) carry a **5% FINAL** withholding tax. Once withheld, they are excluded from the 10% annual base -- no double taxation.

### 5.7 Child Tax Relief

**Legislation:** ZDDFL (PwC, *Deductions*)

The annual taxable base is reduced by: **BGN 6,000 / EUR 3,067.75** (one child), **BGN 12,000 / EUR 6,135.50** (two), **BGN 18,000 / EUR 9,203.25** (three or more), and **BGN 12,000 / EUR 6,135.50** for a disabled child (PwC, *Deductions*; EUR at 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN). Only one parent may claim; usable monthly in advance via the employer or through the annual/quarterly return.

### 5.8 Filing and Payment

**Legislation:** ZDDFL (PwC, *Tax administration*)

| Item | Detail |
|---|---|
| Annual return (Art. 50, form 2001) -- individuals | Due 30 April of the following year (2025 return due 30 April 2026) |
| Annual return -- sole traders (ET) | File/pay 1 March -- 30 June of the following year |
| Quarterly advance PIT (freelance/rental/other) | By end of the month following each of Q1--Q3; **no Q4 advance for individuals** |
| Corrective return | One penalty-free corrective return by 30 September of the following year |
| Early-filing discount | 5% off tax due, **capped at BGN 500 / EUR 255.65**, if filed electronically and paid by 31 March with no outstanding public liabilities |

### 5.9 VAT Interaction

| Scenario | Income Tax Treatment |
|---|---|
| VAT registration threshold | Turnover above **BGN 100,000 (EUR 51,130)** over the relevant/previous calendar year (PwC, *Income determination*) |
| VAT collected on sales (registered) | NOT income -- exclude from the gross base |
| Input VAT recovered (registered) | NOT an expense (ET) -- exclude |
| Not VAT-registered | Gross (VAT-inclusive) amount is the cost/income |

### 5.10 Non-Deductible / Excluded Items

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Income tax itself | Tax on income |
| Fines and penalties | Public policy |
| Personal living expenses | Not business-related |
| Drawings / personal withdrawals | Not an expense |
| Dividends already taxed at 5% | Final tax -- exclude from 10% base |
| VAT liability payments | Not an expense |

## Section 6 -- Tier 2 Catalogue (Reviewer Judgement Required)

### 6.1 Correct Normative-Deduction Percentage

- 25% (general), 40% (liberal professions / royalties), 60% (registered agricultural producers), 10% (rental) -- the activity classification drives a materially different result (PwC, *Deductions*).

**Conservative default:** 25% (general self-employment) until activity confirmed.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the activity matches the claimed deduction percentage.

### 6.2 Self-Insured Maternity-Coverage Election

- Opting into the General Sickness & Maternity fund adds 3.5% (27.8% -> 31.3% per the component arithmetic in Section 1).

**Conservative default:** Maternity NOT elected (27.8%).

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the election and the correct self-insured total (see Section 1 caveat).

### 6.3 Birth Year and Pension Allocation

- Persons born before 1960 pay the full pension contribution to the state fund; those born after 1959 redirect 5% to the 2nd-pillar universal fund. The TOTAL is unchanged, but allocation differs (Ministry of Economy).

**Conservative default:** Born after 1959 (universal fund applies).

### 6.4 Declared Insurable Income (self-insured)

- Self-insured persons declare an insurable income within the min/max band; the year-end reconciliation against actual income can create an additional contribution liability (Ruskov & Kollegen).

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the declared base and the annual reconciliation.

### 6.5 Sole Trader (ET) Expense Substantiation

- ET actual-expense deductions under the CIT-Act base require valid documentation and adjustment for non-deductible items.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm expense substantiation and CIT-Act adjustments.

### 6.6 Employer Accident-Fund Risk Class

- The accident fund (0.4%--1.1%) is employer-only and varies by economic-activity risk class, moving the employer total within the published band.

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm the employer's risk class before finalising employer cost (see Section 1 caveat).

### 6.7 Residency Determination

- Resident (permanent address with centre of vital interests, OR >183 days in any 12-month period) = worldwide income; non-resident = Bulgarian-source only (PwC, *Taxes on personal income*).

**Flag for reviewer:** Confirm residency where presence is borderline.

> **[RESEARCH GAP -- reviewer to confirm]** NRA/NSSI primary-source pages (nra.bg, nssi.bg) were not directly fetched; figures rely on PwC Worldwide Tax Summaries and official Ministry of Economy/Finance pages (authoritative and mutually consistent). The exact 2026 insurable-income bands beyond those published in EUR should be re-verified against the finalised 2026 Public Social Insurance Budget Act. Late-payment interest fluctuates with the BNB/ECB base rate each half-year.

## PROHIBITIONS

- NEVER apply the 10% rate to a sole trader (ET) -- ET profit is taxed at 15% on a CIT-Act base
- NEVER itemise individual expenses for a non-ET freelancer -- use the statutory normative deduction (25%/40%/60%/10%)
- NEVER tax a dividend at 10% -- it carries a 5% FINAL withholding tax and is excluded from the 10% base
- NEVER apply contributions outside the statutory min/max insurable-income band
- NEVER allow income tax itself, fines, or drawings as a deduction
- NEVER assume a tax-free allowance band -- Bulgaria has none; the flat 10% applies from the first lev
- NEVER omit the 5% 2nd-pillar Universal Pension Fund from the employee/employer contribution totals (born after 1959) -- the reconciled rates are employee 13.78%, employer 18.92%--19.62%, self-insured 27.8% (31.3% with optional maternity); the precise per-fund split remains a Section 1 [RESEARCH GAP] for the reviewer
- NEVER mix BGN and EUR figures -- BGN through 31 Dec 2025, EUR from 1 Jan 2026 at 1 EUR = 1.95583 BGN
- NEVER present tax calculations as definitive -- always label as estimated and pass to the deterministic engine / reviewer
