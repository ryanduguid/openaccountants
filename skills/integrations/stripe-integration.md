## Section 1 — Platform Overview

Stripe is an online payment processing platform used by businesses of all sizes to accept card payments, manage subscriptions, send invoices, and handle payouts. Headquartered in the US (San Francisco/Dublin), Stripe operates in 47+ countries. It is the dominant payment processor for SaaS, e-commerce, and platform/marketplace businesses.

Stripe provides two main CSV export paths: **Dashboard exports** (Balance > Download CSV) and **Reporting API exports** (programmatic, customisable columns). Most users export from the Dashboard.

---

## Section 2 — Export Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| CSV | Balance transactions (itemised), payouts (itemised), balance summary. Downloaded from Dashboard or via Reporting API. |
| PDF | Individual invoices, receipts |
| JSON | API responses (for developers) |
| Excel | Not native — users convert CSV to Excel manually |

The **Balance change from activity (itemised)** CSV is the primary export for bookkeeping. The **Payouts (itemised)** CSV links transactions to specific bank payouts.

---

## Section 4 — Transaction Type Codes

Stripe uses the `reporting_category` field for accounting classification:

| reporting_category | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
| charge | Successful payment from a customer |
| refund | Full or partial refund to customer |
| dispute | Chargeback initiated by cardholder |
| dispute_reversal | Chargeback reversed (won by merchant) |
| transfer | Payout to connected account (Stripe Connect) |
| fee | Stripe platform fees |
| connect_reserved_funds | Funds held in reserve |
| payout | Transfer to the merchant's bank account |
| payout_reversal | Payout reversed/returned by bank |
| other_adjustment | Manual adjustments by Stripe |
| partial_capture_reversal | Uncaptured portion of an authorisation |
| issuing_authorization_hold | Stripe Issuing card hold |
| topup | Balance top-up |

The legacy `type` field uses older values: payment, refund, transfer, adjustment, payout, stripe_fee. Prefer `reporting_category` for new integrations.

---

## Section 5 — Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Typical Rate | How It Appears |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Card processing | 2.9% + $0.30 (US) / 1.4% + £0.20 (UK/EEA) | Deducted per transaction in the `fee` column |
| International card surcharge | +1.5% | Added to the base fee |
| Currency conversion | +1% | Added when customer currency differs from settlement currency |
| Dispute (chargeback) fee | $15.00 | Separate line with reporting_category = dispute |
| Refund fee | Processing fee not returned | Original fee remains; refund appears as negative gross |
| Stripe Tax | Varies | Separate line items on Stripe-issued invoices |
| Connect platform fee | Custom | Separate line for platform/marketplace setups |

Stripe always reports gross, fee, and net separately. The `fee` column is the total fee including all components (processing + international + currency conversion).

---

## Section 6 — Tax-Relevant Fields

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| currency | Determines which tax jurisdiction may apply. |
| customer_facing_currency | Original currency the customer was charged in. |
| customer_email / customer_name | May be needed for reverse-charge VAT on B2B cross-border sales. |
| Stripe Tax | If Stripe Tax is enabled, tax amounts appear as separate data via the Stripe Tax API/exports, not in the balance transaction CSV. |
| Stripe-issued invoices | Stripe charges VAT on its own fees to EU/UK businesses. This appears on Stripe's invoice to the merchant, not in the balance CSV. |

Stripe does NOT include the merchant's output VAT/GST in the balance transaction CSV. Tax on sales must be calculated separately using the order/invoice data, not the Stripe payout data.

---

## Section 7 — Multi-Currency Handling

| Scenario | How It Appears |
|----------|---------------|
| Single-currency | All rows in one currency. `currency` column is consistent. |
| Multi-currency settlement | Separate balance per currency. Each CSV download is per-currency. |
| Cross-currency payment | `customer_facing_amount` and `customer_facing_currency` show original charge. `gross`/`fee`/`net` are in settlement currency. |
| Exchange rate | Not shown as a column in the standard CSV. Calculate from customer_facing_amount ÷ gross. Available via API as `exchange_rate` on the BalanceTransaction object. |
| Presentment vs settlement | A €50 charge settled in USD appears as gross = $54.50 (at Stripe's rate), customer_facing_amount = 50.00, customer_facing_currency = eur. |

---

## Section 8 — Reconciliation Tips

1. **Match payouts to bank.** Each payout (po_xxx) groups multiple balance transactions. The bank statement shows one deposit; the Stripe CSV shows the individual transactions. Sum `net` for each `automatic_payout_id` to match the bank deposit.
2. **Payout timing.** Standard payouts arrive 2 business days after the transaction (US). T+7 for new accounts. Expect date mismatches between Stripe `created` date and bank statement date.
3. **Fees are already deducted.** The bank deposit equals the sum of `net` amounts, not `gross`. Do not double-count fees.
4. **Refunds reduce the payout.** A refund in a payout period reduces the total payout amount. The bank deposit is net of refunds.
5. **Disputes temporarily remove funds.** A dispute appears as a negative `gross`. If won, a `dispute_reversal` adds funds back.
6. **Rolling reserve.** New or high-risk accounts may have funds held in reserve. These appear as `connect_reserved_funds` with later release.
7. **Stripe CSV has 9+ columns.** Cannot be directly imported into QuickBooks (max 4 columns) or most accounting software without transformation.

## Section 9 — Common Gotchas

1. **Gross vs net confusion.** The Stripe payout equals the SUM of `net`, not `gross`. Booking `gross` as revenue and `fee` as expense is correct accounting but the bank deposit matches `net`.
2. **Fee on refund.** When a payment is refunded, Stripe does not return the original processing fee. The refund row shows the refund amount as negative gross, zero fee, and negative net.
3. **Amounts in major units.** Stripe CSV exports amounts in dollars/pounds (100.00), but the API uses minor units/cents (10000). Ensure consistency when mixing sources.
4. **Lowercase currency codes.** Stripe uses "usd" not "USD" in CSV exports. Normalise to uppercase for accounting software.
5. **Timezone sensitivity.** `created (UTC)` is in UTC. Bank statements use local time. A late-night transaction may appear on different dates.
6. **Connect platforms.** If the user operates a Stripe Connect marketplace, application fees and transfers to connected accounts create additional balance transaction rows.
7. **Subscription invoices vs one-time payments.** Both appear as `charge` in reporting_category. Use `invoice_id` to distinguish recurring from one-time.
