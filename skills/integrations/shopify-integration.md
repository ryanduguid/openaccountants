## Section 1 — Platform Overview

Shopify is an e-commerce platform used by merchants in 175+ countries to sell products online, in-store, and across social media channels. Headquartered in Canada, Shopify powers businesses from single-product stores to large enterprises. Shopify Payments is the integrated payment processor (powered by Stripe).

Shopify produces two distinct CSV exports relevant to bookkeeping: the **Payments export** (financial transactions from Shopify Payments) and the **Orders export** (order-level data including line items, shipping, and customer details). These serve different purposes and have different column structures.

---

## Section 2 — Export Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| CSV (Plain) | Payments transactions (from Finance > Payouts > View Transactions > Export > Plain CSV). The correct format for accounting. |
| CSV for Excel | Payments transactions with extra formatting rows. Breaks most import tools — avoid for accounting. |
| CSV | Orders export (from Orders page > Export). Order-level data with line items. |
| PDF | Individual order invoices, packing slips. |
| Excel (XLSX) | Financial summary reports. |

**Critical: Always use "Plain CSV" for payment data.** "CSV for Excel" adds summary rows that break column header detection in accounting software.

## Section 3 — Column Mapping

### Shopify Payments CSV (Plain — Finance > Payouts)

| Checkout | Shopify checkout token (internal reference). |
| Payment Method | Payment method type (shopify_payments, manual, gift_card, etc.). |

## Section 4 — Transaction Type Codes

### Shopify Payments CSV types

|------|---------|
| charge | Successful payment collected from customer |
| refund | Full or partial refund to customer |
| dispute | Chargeback initiated by cardholder |
| reserve_payout | Funds released from Shopify's reserve |
| adjustment | Manual adjustment by Shopify |
| payout | Transfer to merchant's bank account |

| authorized | Card authorized but not captured |
| partially_paid | Deposit or partial payment received |
| partially_refunded | Some items refunded |
| refunded | Fully refunded |
| pending | Awaiting payment |

---

## Section 5 — Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Typical Rate | How It Appears |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Shopify Payments (online, domestic) | 2.9% + $0.30 (Basic), 2.6% + $0.30 (Shopify), 2.4% + $0.30 (Advanced) | Positive value in Fee column per charge row |
| Shopify Payments (in-person) | 2.7% + $0.00 (Basic), 2.5% + $0.00 (Shopify), 2.4% + $0.00 (Advanced) | Positive value in Fee column |
| International card surcharge | +1.5% | Added to base fee |
| Currency conversion fee | +1.5% | Added when customer currency ≠ store currency |
| Chargeback fee | $15 (US) | Separate charge on the dispute row |
| Third-party payment provider fee | 2% / 1% / 0.5% | Not in Payments CSV — billed separately by Shopify |
| Shopify subscription | $39–399/month | Not in transaction exports — billed to account |
| Refund fee | Processing fee NOT returned | Original Fee remains; no fee on refund row |

**Key: Fee is stored as a POSITIVE number.** Net = Amount - Fee. This is the opposite of PayPal where Fee is negative.

---

## Section 6 — Tax-Relevant Fields

| Field | Location | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Taxes | Orders CSV | Total tax on the order. Sum of all line-item taxes. |
| Lineitem taxable | Orders CSV | Whether tax was charged on this line item. |
| Billing Country | Orders CSV | Customer's country — critical for cross-border tax obligations. |
| Billing Province | Orders CSV | State/province for US/Canadian sales tax nexus. |
| Currency | Both CSVs | Tax jurisdiction may depend on the transaction currency. |
| Tax lines (not in CSV) | Shopify admin/API | Detailed tax breakdown by jurisdiction (available via API, not in standard CSV export). |

Shopify can be configured to collect taxes automatically based on product taxability and customer location. Tax amounts in the Orders CSV reflect what was actually charged. For detailed tax reporting by jurisdiction, use Shopify's Tax report in Finance > Reports, not the Orders CSV.

---

## Section 7 — Multi-Currency Handling

| Scenario | How It Appears |
|----------|---------------|
| Single-currency store | All transactions in one currency. Currency column is consistent. |
| Multi-currency store (Shopify Payments) | Amount and Fee are in the store's settlement (payout) currency. Customer may have paid in a different currency. |
| Customer-facing currency | Not visible in the Payments CSV. Available in the Orders CSV via Currency column. |
| Exchange rate | Not shown in CSV exports. Shopify converts at its own rate (includes 1.5% conversion fee). |
| International pricing | Shopify Markets may show different prices per country. The Orders CSV shows what the customer paid in their currency; the Payments CSV shows the settlement amount. |

---

## Section 8 — Reconciliation Tips

1. **Use the Payments CSV for bank reconciliation, not the Orders CSV.** The Payments CSV shows what actually moved to/from the bank. The Orders CSV shows what customers ordered, which is different due to timing, partial payments, and multi-tender orders.
2. **Match payouts to bank deposits.** Filter by Payout Date and sum Net amounts for each Payout ID. This total should match the bank deposit.
3. **Fee is POSITIVE.** Unlike PayPal/Stripe. Net = Amount - Fee. If Amount = 100 and Fee = 3.20, Net = 96.80.
4. **Refunds reduce payout amount.** Refunds in a payout period reduce the total deposited. A payout with $1000 in charges and $200 in refunds deposits $800 minus fees.
5. **"CSV for Excel" breaks imports.** Always export "Plain CSV". The Excel variant adds summary rows at the top.
6. **Multi-line orders in Orders CSV.** An order with 3 items has 3 rows. Total/Subtotal/Taxes are the same on each row — do not sum them or you'll triple-count.
7. **Gift cards are not revenue when sold.** Gift card purchases are a liability. Revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed. Shopify handles this differently in the Payments vs Orders export.

---

## Section 9 — Common Gotchas

1. **Orders CSV vs Payments CSV confusion.** Users often export from Orders instead of Finance > Payouts. The Orders CSV does not include processing fees and does not match bank deposits.
2. **Fee sign convention.** Shopify Fees are positive numbers (unusual). Most tools expect negative fees. When converting for QuickBooks import, negate the Fee values.
3. **Timestamp timezone offset.** Transaction Date includes timezone (e.g., -0500). If comparing to bank dates in a different timezone, convert first.
4. **Duplicate rows in Orders CSV.** Each line item is a row. Order-level amounts (Total, Taxes) repeat on every line-item row. Do not sum Totals across line-item rows for the same order.
5. **Partial refunds create new rows.** A partial refund appears as a new row in the Payments CSV with Type = refund. The original charge row is unchanged.
6. **Discount codes reduce Subtotal.** If a 20% discount is applied, Subtotal reflects the discounted price. The Discount Amount column shows the discount value for reference.
7. **POS vs online transactions.** In-person (POS) transactions use the same Payments CSV format but have different fee rates. Card Source distinguishes them (chip, contactless, swipe vs online).
8. **Shopify shipping labels.** If the merchant buys shipping labels through Shopify, these charges appear as deductions in the payout but are NOT in the Payments transaction CSV. Check the payout summary.
