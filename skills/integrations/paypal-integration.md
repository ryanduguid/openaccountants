## Section 1 — Platform Overview

PayPal is a global payment platform used by individuals and businesses for online payments, invoicing, and money transfers. Headquartered in the US, PayPal operates in 200+ markets and supports 25+ currencies. It serves everyone from eBay sellers and freelancers to enterprise e-commerce businesses.

PayPal's Activity Download CSV is notoriously complex — up to 41 columns, fees as separate transaction rows, multiple transaction types, and locale-dependent formatting. It is widely considered the most difficult payment platform export to reconcile.

## Section 2 — Export Formats

| Format | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| CSV | Activity Download Report (up to 41 columns, max 50,000 rows, max 12 months per export, 7-year history) |
| TAB | Tab-separated alternative to CSV |
| PDF | Monthly statements, individual transaction receipts |
| QIF | Quicken import format |
| IIF | QuickBooks Desktop import format (US only) |

The Activity Download CSV is accessed via: Activity page > Statements > Activity Download > Select date range > Choose CSV format > Download.

For merchants with high volume, PayPal also offers the **Balance Reconciliation Report** (SFTP-delivered CSV with structured header/body/footer format).

## Section 4 — Transaction Type Codes

PayPal uses verbose, human-readable type descriptions:

| Type | Meaning | Balance Impact |
|------|---------|----------------|
| Web Accept Payment Received | Payment received via PayPal button/checkout | Credit |
| Express Checkout Payment Received | Payment via Express Checkout | Credit |
| Mobile Payment Received | Payment received via mobile | Credit |
| Payment Received | Generic incoming payment | Credit |
| Invoice Received | Payment received against a PayPal invoice | Credit |
| Recurring Payment Received | Subscription/recurring charge collected | Credit |
| Payment Sent | Outgoing payment to another PayPal user | Debit |
| Refund | Refund issued to buyer (reverses a previous payment) | Debit |
| Payment Reversal | Chargeback or dispute reversal | Debit |
| Temporary Hold | Funds temporarily held by PayPal (disputes, reviews) | Debit |
| Payment Release | Held funds released | Credit |
| Transfer to Bank | Withdrawal to linked bank account | Debit |
| Bank Deposit to PayPal | Deposit from linked bank account | Credit |
| Currency Conversion | FX conversion between currencies | Both |
| General Authorization | Pre-authorisation (no funds moved yet) | None |
| PayPal fee | Monthly/service fee charged by PayPal | Debit |

---

## Section 5 — Fee Structure

| Fee Type | Typical Rate | How It Appears |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Domestic payment processing | 2.99% + $0.49 (US standard) | Negative value in Fee column of the payment row |
| International payment processing | 4.49% + fixed fee | Negative value in Fee column |
| Micropayment rate | 5% + $0.05 (for transactions under $10) | Negative value in Fee column |
| Currency conversion spread | ~3-4% above mid-market rate | NOT shown as a fee. Embedded in the exchange rate. |
| Chargeback fee | $20 | Separate transaction row with Type = "Payment Reversal" |
| Withdrawal fee | Usually free for standard, $0.25 for instant | Separate row or deducted from withdrawal |
| Monthly fee | Varies by plan | Separate row with Type = "PayPal fee" |
| Invoicing fee | 2.99% + $0.49 | In Fee column of the invoice payment row |

Critical: PayPal fees appear in the **same row** as the payment (in the Fee column), unlike Wise where fees are separate rows.

---

## Section 6 — Tax-Relevant Fields

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Sales Tax | Column 21. Contains the tax amount if the buyer paid tax through PayPal. Often blank — most merchants handle tax externally. |
| Country / Country Code | Buyer's country. Critical for determining cross-border VAT obligations (EU distance selling, UK import VAT). |
| Invoice Number | Links to your invoicing system for VAT/GST matching. |
| Gross vs Net | Gross includes tax and shipping if applicable. For VAT purposes, you need the net amount excluding shipping and tax. |
| Currency | Determines which country's tax rules may apply for FX transactions. |
| 1099-K reporting (US) | PayPal issues 1099-K forms for US sellers meeting thresholds. Data comes from these same transaction records. |
| DAC7 reporting (EU) | PayPal reports EU seller activity to tax authorities under DAC7. |

---

## Section 7 — Multi-Currency Handling

| Scenario | How It Appears |
|----------|---------------|
| Single-currency | All rows share the same Currency value. Straightforward. |
| Received in foreign currency, held | Payment row shows Currency = foreign currency, Gross = foreign amount. Balance Impact = Credit. |
| Received and auto-converted | Two rows: (1) Payment received in foreign currency, (2) "Currency Conversion" row showing the conversion. Both share a related Transaction ID. |
| Currency conversion | Two rows: a debit in the source currency and a credit in the target currency. The exchange rate is NOT shown as a separate column — it must be calculated from the two amounts. |
| Withdrawal in non-default currency | PayPal converts to the bank's currency. Conversion row appears before the withdrawal row. |

PayPal's multi-currency handling is messy. Conversion rows and payment rows are separate, linked by Reference Txn ID. You must match them to determine the effective exchange rate.

## Section 8 — Reconciliation Tips

1. **Filter by Status = "Completed" first.** Pending, Denied, and Reversed transactions should be excluded from the books. Only Completed transactions represent actual money movement.
2. **Match Transfer to Bank rows to bank deposits.** PayPal batches multiple transactions into one bank transfer. Sum all rows between "Transfer to Bank" entries to match bank deposits.
3. **Fees are in the payment row, not separate rows.** Unlike Wise, PayPal deducts fees in the same row. The Fee column is negative. Net = Gross + Fee.
4. **Temporary Holds and Releases net to zero.** A hold debits the balance, a release credits it back. They should cancel out and not appear in the P&L.
5. **Refunds reference the original transaction.** Use Reference Txn ID (column 26) to match refunds to their original payments.
6. **Currency Conversions are noise for bookkeeping.** They represent internal movement, not income or expense. Filter them out of P&L calculations.
7. **50,000-row limit.** Large accounts will receive a ZIP file with multiple CSVs. Process all files for a complete picture.
8. **Locale affects everything.** Date format, decimal separator, and even column names can change based on the user's PayPal locale setting. Always check the first row.

## Section 9 — Common Gotchas

1. **Fees as separate rows vs same row — inconsistent.** Most fees are in the Fee column of the payment row, but some (chargeback fees, monthly fees) are entirely separate rows. You must handle both patterns.
2. **Gross includes shipping and tax.** For revenue calculations, Gross is NOT your sales revenue if the buyer paid shipping through PayPal. Subtract Shipping and Sales Tax columns.
3. **Currency Conversion rows inflate totals.** If you sum all Credit-impact rows as revenue, currency conversions will double-count. Filter Type = "Currency Conversion" out.
4. **"General Authorization" has no money movement.** These rows show pre-auths that haven't captured. Exclude them.
5. **Email addresses as identifiers.** PayPal identifies counterparties by email, not by name. The same person may appear with different names but the same email (or vice versa).
6. **Balance column may not match your actual balance.** If you filtered the export by date range, the Balance column reflects only the filtered period, not the actual account balance.
7. **Negative Gross on refunds.** Refunds show as negative Gross with zero Fee. The original payment's fee is not returned.
8. **Time zones matter.** PayPal records times in the user's selected timezone. A transaction at 11:30 PM PST on March 31 is April 1 in UTC.
9. **Column names are locale-dependent.** A German PayPal account may export columns as "Datum", "Brutto", "Gebühr" instead of "Date", "Gross", "Fee".
