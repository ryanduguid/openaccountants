name: jp-return-assembly
description: Final orchestrator skill that assembles the complete Japanese filing package for Japan-resident self-employed individuals and sole proprietors (個人事業主). Consumes outputs from all Japanese content skills (japan-consumption-tax for 消費税, japan-income-tax for 所得税確定申告, japan-social-insurance for 社会保険料, jp-estimated-tax for 予定納税) to produce a single unified reviewer package containing every worksheet, every form, every brief section, all cross-skill reconciliations, and the final action list with payment instructions, filing instructions, and next-year planning. This is the capstone skill that runs last and produces the final deliverable. MUST be loaded alongside all Japanese content skills listed above. Japan full-year residents only. Self-employed individuals and sole proprietors (個人事業主) only.

# Japan Return Assembly Skill v1.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE -- READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, you have already passed through intake. The user has consented to the full workflow. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

Specifically:

- **Do NOT ask the user "how deep do you want me to go"** or "do you want the full package" or any variant. The user asked for their tax returns. They want their tax returns. Produce them.
- **Do NOT announce how many tokens or tool calls this will take.** Execute.
- **Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritise.** Produce all deliverables listed in Section 4. If you run out of context mid-execution, finish the computation work first (numbers, positions, flags) then produce whatever formatted outputs you can, and at the very end state clearly which deliverables were not produced and why.
- **Do NOT re-validate scope that intake already validated.** If `jp-freelance-intake` produced an intake package, trust it. You can cross-check specific numbers during reconciliation but do not re-interrogate the user about residency, business structure, or anything else intake already captured.
- **Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.** Run them in dependency order (Section 2) without prose status updates between each one. A single status message at the end is fine.
- **Self-checks are targets, not blockers.** If a self-check fails, note it in the reviewer brief's open flags section and continue. Do NOT halt the entire workflow because one self-check had an ambiguous answer.
- **Primary source citations go in the final reviewer brief, not in intermediate computation steps.**

**The user has already been told (by the intake skill) that the final package requires 税理士 signoff before filing. State it once in the final output and move on.**

**Failure mode to avoid:** The skill halts mid-execution and asks the user a meta-question about workflow pacing. If you feel the urge to ask "how should I proceed," the correct action is to pick the most defensible path and proceed, flagging the decision in the reviewer brief so the reviewer can challenge it.

## What this file is

The final capstone skill for Japanese self-employed returns. Every Japanese content skill feeds into this one. The output is the complete reviewer package that a 税理士 (zeirishi) can review, sign off on, and deliver to the client along with filing instructions.

This skill coordinates execution of the content skills, verifies cross-skill consistency, and assembles the final deliverable.

---

## Section 1 -- Scope

Produces the complete Japanese filing package for:
- Full-year Japan residents
- Self-employed individuals and sole proprietors (個人事業主)
- Tax year 2025 (令和7年分)
- Filing 所得税確定申告書 (income tax return), 消費税確定申告書 (consumption tax return if applicable), 青色申告決算書 or 収支内訳書, social insurance reconciliation, estimated tax schedule

---

## Section 2 -- Execution order and dependency chain

The skill enforces the following execution order:

1. **`japan-consumption-tax`** -- 消費税確定申告書 (consumption tax return)
   - Runs first because consumption tax figures affect income tax computation (consumption tax paid is a deductible expense for income tax if using tax-inclusive accounting, or a reconciliation item if using tax-exclusive)
   - Determine method: 本則課税 (standard), 簡易課税 (simplified), or 2割特例 (20% special provision)
   - For 本則課税: compute 課税売上 (taxable sales), 課税仕入れ (taxable purchases), 仕入税額控除 (input tax credit)
   - For 簡易課税: apply みなし仕入率 (deemed purchase rate) by 事業区分 (business category: 第1種~第6種, e.g., services = 第5種 at 50%)
   - For 2割特例: tax = 売上消費税 x 20% (available through 令和8年9月30日を含む課税期間)
   - Verify eligibility for chosen method
   - Output: 消費税額 due, method used, form values

2. **`japan-income-tax`** -- 所得税確定申告書 with 青色申告決算書 or 収支内訳書
   - Depends on consumption tax: if 税込経理 (tax-inclusive accounting), consumption tax paid is an expense (租税公課); if 税抜経理 (tax-exclusive), no impact on income but reconciliation needed
   - Compute 売上 (revenue), 売上原価 (COGS if applicable), 経費 (expenses by category), 差引金額 (net income before adjustments)
   - Apply 青色申告特別控除 (blue return special deduction): ¥650,000 (e-Tax + double-entry), ¥550,000 (double-entry paper), ¥100,000 (simplified)
   - Compute 事業所得 (business income)
   - Add other income categories if applicable
   - Apply 所得控除 (income deductions): 基礎控除 ¥480,000, 社会保険料控除, 小規模企業共済等掛金控除, 生命保険料控除, 地震保険料控除, 配偶者控除/特別控除, 扶養控除, 医療費控除, 寄附金控除 (ふるさと納税), etc.
   - Compute 課税所得 (taxable income)
   - Apply 所得税率 (progressive rates): 5% up to ¥1,950,000; 10% up to ¥3,300,000; 20% up to ¥6,950,000; 23% up to ¥9,000,000; 33% up to ¥18,000,000; 40% up to ¥40,000,000; 45% above
   - Apply 復興特別所得税 (reconstruction special income tax): 2.1% of income tax
   - Apply 配当控除 (dividend credit) if applicable
   - Apply 住宅借入金等特別控除 (housing loan deduction) if applicable
   - Credit 源泉徴収税額 (withholding tax) and 予定納税額 (estimated tax paid)
   - Output: 申告納税額 (tax payable) or 還付金 (refund), all form line values

3. **`japan-social-insurance`** -- 社会保険料 reconciliation
   - Depends on income tax: social insurance premiums paid enter 社会保険料控除 on the income tax return
   - 国民健康保険 (National Health Insurance): premiums vary by municipality, based on prior year income. Verify amount paid matches expected.
   - 国民年金 (National Pension): fixed monthly amount (¥16,980 for 2025). Verify 12 months paid or note any 免除 (exemption) periods.
   - 小規模企業共済 (Small Enterprise Mutual Aid): entered under 小規模企業共済等掛金控除 (separate from 社会保険料控除)
   - iDeCo: also entered under 小規模企業共済等掛金控除
   - Output: total deduction amounts by category, payments verified

4. **`jp-estimated-tax`** -- 予定納税 and forward-looking schedule
   - Depends on income tax: 2026 予定納税 is based on 2025 申告納税額
   - If 2025 申告納税額 ≥ ¥150,000: 予定納税 applies for 2026
   - Each instalment = 申告納税額 / 3 (rounded down to nearest ¥100)
   - 1st period: July 1-31, 2026
   - 2nd period: November 1-30, 2026
   - 減額申請 (reduction request) available if income is expected to decrease significantly
   - Output: instalment amounts and dates for 2026

If any upstream content skill fails to produce validated output, the assembly skill notes the failure in the reviewer brief and continues with available data rather than halting entirely.

## Section 3 -- Cross-skill reconciliation

### Cross-check 1: Revenue consistency across consumption tax and income tax

| Consumption Tax Output | Income Tax Input | Rule |
|----------------------|-----------------|------|
| 課税売上高 (taxable sales, tax-excluded) | 青色申告決算書 売上(収入)金額 (revenue) | Must match within ¥1 |
| If 税込経理: 売上 includes consumption tax | 決算書 売上 = tax-inclusive amount | Consumption tax paid recorded as 租税公課 expense |
| If 税抜経理: 売上 excludes consumption tax | 決算書 売上 = tax-exclusive amount | No consumption tax in revenue or expense lines |
| Export sales (輸出免税) | Included in income but zero-rated for consumption tax | Reconcile total vs taxable |

**If mismatch:** Flag for reviewer. Common causes: timing differences (発生主義 accrual vs 現金主義 cash basis), 非課税売上 (non-taxable sales), free sample/promotional items.

### Cross-check 2: Business income vs miscellaneous income classification (事業所得 vs 雑所得)

| Factor | 事業所得 (Business Income) | 雑所得 (Miscellaneous Income) |
|--------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| 開業届 filed | Yes | Typically no |
| Continuity and scale | Regular, ongoing activity | Sporadic, side activity |
| 青色申告 | Available | Not available |
| Loss offset (損益通算) | Yes -- offsets against other income | No -- cannot offset losses |
| 繰越損失 (loss carryforward) | Up to 3 years (blue return) | Not available |

**NTA guidance (令和4年通達改正):** If revenue < ¥3M and no dedicated bookkeeping, the NTA may reclassify as 雑所得. If the user has 開業届 + blue return + proper books, 事業所得 is defensible. Flag if borderline.

### Cross-check 3: 青色申告特別控除 level verification

| Requirement | ¥650,000 | ¥550,000 | ¥100,000 |
|------------|----------|----------|----------|
| Double-entry bookkeeping (複式簿記) | Required | Required | Not required |
| e-Tax filing OR 電子帳簿保存 | Required (either one) | Not required | Not required |
| 貸借対照表 + 損益計算書 submitted | Required | Required | Not required |

**If the user claims ¥650,000 but files on paper:** Reduce to ¥550,000. Flag.
**If the user claims ¥550,000 but uses simplified bookkeeping:** Reduce to ¥100,000. Flag.

### Cross-check 4: Social insurance deductions match payments

| Deduction Claimed | Verification Source | Rule |
|------------------|-------------------|------|
| 社会保険料控除 (国民健康保険) | Municipality payment notice / bank debits | Amount claimed = amount actually paid in calendar year 2025 |
| 社会保険料控除 (国民年金) | 国民年金控除証明書 from 日本年金機構 | Certificate amount = claimed amount |
| 小規模企業共済等掛金控除 | 控除証明書 from 中小企業基盤整備機構 / 国民年金基金連合会 | Certificate amount = claimed amount |

**If mismatch:** Deduction cannot exceed actual amount paid and certified. Only amounts paid during calendar year 2025 qualify (not amounts due but unpaid).

### Cross-check 5: 源泉徴収 (withholding) reconciliation

| Withholding Claimed | Verification Source | Rule |
|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| 源泉徴収税額 on 確定申告書 | 源泉徴収票 / 支払調書 from payers | Total must match sum of all certificates |
| Rate applied | Payment type per 所得税法第204条 | 10.21% on first ¥1M, 20.42% above for most professional services |

**If withholding exceeds tax liability:** Refund (還付) results. Verify all 源泉徴収票 are included.

### Cross-check 6: Consumption tax method eligibility

| Method | Eligibility | Verification |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| 本則課税 (standard) | Always available | Default if no 届出書 filed |
| 簡易課税 (simplified) | Base period revenue ≤ ¥50M AND 届出書 filed by prior year-end | Verify 届出書 filing date and base period revenue |
| 2割特例 (20% special) | Was 免税事業者 in base period AND registered for インボイス | Verify base period status |

**If 簡易課税 claimed but base period > ¥50M:** Cannot use. Revert to 本則課税. Flag.
**If 2割特例 claimed but was already 課税事業者 in base period:** Cannot use. Flag.

## Section 5 -- Refusals

**R-JP-A1 -- Upstream skill did not run.** Name the specific skill. Note: this is a warning, not a hard stop. Continue with available data and flag the gap.

**R-JP-A2 -- Upstream self-check failed.** Name the specific check and note it in the reviewer brief. Continue.

**R-JP-A3 -- Cross-skill reconciliation failed.** Name the specific reconciliation and describe the discrepancy. Flag for reviewer but continue.

**R-JP-A4 -- Intake incomplete.** Specific missing intake items prevent computation. List what is missing and ask the user for the specific data point.

**R-JP-A5 -- Out-of-scope item discovered during assembly.** E.g., 不動産の譲渡所得, 山林所得, or complex international tax. Flag and exclude from computation.

**R-JP-A6 -- Classification dispute risk.** If the 事業所得 vs 雑所得 boundary is questionable (e.g., low revenue, no 開業届, no proper books), prominently flag in reviewer brief. The 税理士 must confirm the classification is defensible.

---

## Section 6 -- Self-checks

**Check JP1 -- All upstream skills executed.** japan-consumption-tax, japan-income-tax, japan-social-insurance all produced output. jp-estimated-tax produced output or 予定納税 was computed from income tax output.

**Check JP2 -- Revenue matches across consumption tax and income tax.** 課税売上高 = 決算書 売上金額 within ¥1 tolerance (adjusting for accounting method: 税込 vs 税抜).

**Check JP3 -- 事業所得 classification is defensible.** 開業届 filed, blue return approved (if blue), proper bookkeeping maintained. If any factor is missing, flag.

**Check JP4 -- 青色申告特別控除 level is correct.** ¥650,000 only if e-Tax AND double-entry. ¥550,000 only if double-entry. Otherwise ¥100,000 or zero (white return).

**Check JP5 -- Social insurance deductions match certificates.** 控除証明書 amounts = claimed deduction amounts. No uncertified amounts claimed.

**Check JP6 -- 源泉徴収 fully credited.** All withholding certificates accounted for. Total credited on 確定申告書 = sum of all 源泉徴収票 / 支払調書.

**Check JP7 -- Consumption tax method is eligible.** 簡易課税 only if base period ≤ ¥50M and 届出書 filed. 2割特例 only if was 免税事業者 in base period.

**Check JP8 -- 基礎控除 correctly applied.** ¥480,000 if 合計所得 ≤ ¥24M. Reduced if ¥24M-¥25M. Zero if > ¥25M.

**Check JP9 -- 復興特別所得税 applied.** 2.1% of 所得税 added. This is easy to forget.

**Check JP10 -- 予定納税 correctly credited.** Both instalment amounts credited on 確定申告書 第1表 ㊹欄.

**Check JP11 -- Filing calendar is complete.** All deadlines for 所得税, 消費税, 予定納税, and 住民税 are listed with specific dates and amounts.

**Check JP12 -- Reviewer brief contains legislation citations.** Every position taken references the specific article of 所得税法, 消費税法, or 租税特別措置法.

## Section 7 -- Output files

The final output is **three files**:

1. **`[client_slug]_2025_japan_master.xlsx`** -- Single master workbook containing every worksheet and form.

## Section 9 -- Known gaps

1. PDF form filling is not automated. The reviewer uses the worksheets to fill official NTA forms on e-Tax or print forms.
2. e-Tax filing is handled by the reviewer or client, not by this skill.
3. Payment execution is the client's responsibility; the skill only provides instructions and amounts.
4. 住民税 (resident tax) is computed by the municipality based on the 確定申告 data. This skill provides an estimate for planning but cannot produce the official 住民税 notice.
5. Multi-year 減価償却 tracking assumes the prior year schedule is provided. If not, only current-year acquisitions are depreciated.
6. 山林所得 (forestry income) and 退職所得 (retirement income) are out of scope.
7. Complex 譲渡所得 (capital gains) requiring 分離課税 (separate taxation) -- real estate, stocks outside 特定口座 -- are out of scope.
8. 外国税額控除 (foreign tax credit) is supported at a basic level but complex multi-treaty situations are out of scope.
9. 事業税 (enterprise tax) is computed by the prefecture and is not filed separately. Noted for reference in planning.
10. 消費税 中間申告 (interim consumption tax returns) preparation is out of scope but the obligation and deadlines are noted.
11. The package is complete only for the 2025 tax year (令和7年分); 2026 appears only as prospective planning.

### Change log
- **v1.0 (May 2026):** Initial draft. Modelled on mt-return-assembly v0.1 adapted for Japan jurisdiction with four content skills (consumption tax, income tax, social insurance, estimated tax).
