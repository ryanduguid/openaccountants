# Pakistan Return Assembly — Orchestrator v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is
The capstone for a Pakistan-resident freelancer/sole proprietor. It sequences the upstream skills, selects forms, and produces a single pre-filing package via IRIS. It computes nothing.

## Section 1 — What you file
| Item | Where | When (verify) |
|---|---|---|
| Annual income tax return | FBR **IRIS** | By ~30 September following the tax year (individuals) |
| Wealth statement (individuals) | IRIS (with the return) | With the return |
| IT-export income | Reported under the final-tax regime | With the return |
| Sales tax on services | Provincial authority (SRB/PRA/KPRA/BRA/ICT) | Monthly |
| Sales tax on goods | FBR | Monthly |

## Section 2 — Assembly order
1. **Intake** (pk-freelance-intake) → confirm export vs domestic, PSEB, filer/ATL, residency.
2. **Tax base** → pk-it-export-tax (final tax on export proceeds) and/or pk-income-tax (domestic business slabs).
3. **Sales tax** → pakistan-sales-tax (goods/services) if registered.
4. **Social** → pk-social-contributions (usually nil for a solo freelancer; relevant if an employer).
5. **Reconcile** export remittances (PRCs) with declared income; gather withholding-tax certificates for credit.
6. **File** the return + wealth statement via **IRIS**; confirm **ATL** status afterward.

## Section 3 — Pre-filing checklist
- [ ] Export proceeds matched to bank PRCs; final tax computed
- [ ] Domestic income on the correct slabs; expenses documented
- [ ] Wealth statement reconciles to assets/income
- [ ] Withholding-tax credits claimed
- [ ] Sales-tax returns filed (if registered)
- [ ] Return filed on IRIS by the deadline; on the ATL

## Section 10 — Prohibitions
- NEVER file export income under normal slabs when the concession applies (or vice versa).
- NEVER omit the wealth statement for an individual.
- NEVER state deadlines as final without verifying the FBR calendar (extensions are common).

## Disclaimer
Informational only; not advice. Verify forms and deadlines with the FBR. All outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani tax practitioner before filing. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
