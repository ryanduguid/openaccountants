name: us-tx-return-assembly
description: Final orchestrator skill that assembles the complete federal and Texas compliance filing package for Texas resident sole proprietors and single-member LLCs disregarded for federal tax. Consumes outputs from all federal content skills (bookkeeping, Schedule C/SE, QBI, retirement, SE health insurance, quarterly estimated tax, federal assembly, 1099-NEC) and Texas compliance skills (franchise tax Form 05-102 or 05-158/05-169, sales tax where applicable) to produce a single unified reviewer package. Texas has no state income tax, so the assembly focuses on federal return accuracy plus Texas franchise tax filing and sales tax compliance verification. Reconciles federal return totals with Texas franchise tax total revenue computation and verifies sales tax obligations are met.

# US+TX Return Assembly Skill v1.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, you have already passed through intake. The user has consented to the full workflow. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

- Do NOT ask "how deep do you want me to go." Produce the full package.
- Do NOT announce token counts or tool calls.
- Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize.
- Do NOT re-validate scope that intake already validated.
- Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.
- Self-checks are targets, not blockers. Flag failures for reviewer and continue.
- Texas has no income tax return. This skill focuses on: (1) Federal return completeness, (2) Texas franchise tax compliance, (3) Texas sales tax compliance.

## Section 3 — Verification matrix

### Federal internal consistency

- Schedule C net profit → Schedule 1 Line 3 → Form 1040 Line 8
- Schedule SE tax → Schedule 2 Line 4 → Form 1040 Line 23
- Half of SE tax → Schedule 1 Line 15 → Form 1040 Line 10
- SE retirement → Schedule 1 Line 16 → Form 1040 Line 10
- SE health insurance → Schedule 1 Line 17 → Form 1040 Line 10
- QBI deduction → Form 1040 Line 13
- Total tax → Form 1040 Line 24
- Form 2210 penalty (if applicable)
- Total payments → Form 1040 Line 33

### Texas franchise tax consistency

**For entities below $2.47M threshold (majority of freelancers):**
- Total revenue computed from books matches Form 05-102 reporting
- Total revenue on franchise tax report ≤ $2,470,000 (2025 threshold)
- Form 05-102 (No Tax Due Report) filed or flagged for filing
- Public Information Report (PIR) data current and accurate
- Filing deadline: May 15, 2026 (for Dec 31 year-end)

**For entities above $2.47M threshold:**
- Total revenue → Form 05-158 (Texas Franchise Tax Report) Line 1
- Margin computation: Total revenue minus greatest of (COGS, compensation, 30% of revenue, $1M)
- Apportionment factor (if applicable): Texas receipts / total receipts
- Taxable margin → Form 05-158 applicable line
- Tax rate applied: 0.75% (services) or 0.375% (retail/wholesale)
- Franchise tax due
- EZ Computation comparison (Form 05-169): 0.331% × apportioned total revenue — determine if lower
- Franchise tax payments and credits

**Total revenue definition for TX franchise tax:**
Per Texas Tax Code §171.1011, total revenue includes:
- Gross receipts from Schedule C (federal)
- Other income items per IRC §61 that are not specifically excluded
- Excludes: flow-through funds that are not revenue to the entity, certain pass-through distributions

**Cross-check:** Schedule C Line 1 (gross receipts) should approximate total revenue reported on TX franchise tax return. Differences may arise from:
- Returns and allowances (Schedule C Line 2)
- Income items not on Schedule C (interest, other income)
- Items excluded from TX total revenue by statute

### Texas sales tax consistency (if applicable)

- Taxable sales reported on sales tax returns match invoices/receipts for taxable items
- Sales tax collected matches deposits in bank statement
- Sales tax remitted matches Comptroller payments
- Filing frequency correct (monthly/quarterly/annually)
- No unfiled periods with active permit
- If no taxable sales and permit is active: $0 returns filed

### Federal estimated tax verification

- Four quarterly payments verified against bank statement / EFTPS records
- Safe harbor analysis: 100% of 2024 tax (if 2024 AGI ≤ $150K) or 110% of 2024 tax (if 2024 AGI > $150K)
- If underpaid: Form 2210 penalty computed
- Note: no state estimated tax exists in Texas — only federal

---

## Section 4 — Texas-specific considerations

### No state income tax deduction on federal return

Texas residents cannot deduct state income tax on federal Schedule A (because there is none). However:
- Texas sales tax paid can be deducted on Schedule A Line 5a (state and local general sales tax) as an alternative to state income tax
- IRS provides optional sales tax tables or taxpayer can use actual records
- For 2025: SALT deduction cap remains $10,000 ($5,000 MFS) — may limit benefit

### Franchise tax interaction with federal positions

- QBI deduction (§199A): No Texas equivalent or interaction. QBI is purely federal.
- Depreciation: Texas franchise tax uses federal depreciation for COGS computation. No state-level depreciation difference.
- Retirement contributions: Not relevant to franchise tax (franchise tax is on revenue/margin, not personal deductions).

### Texas LLC annual obligations

- **No annual franchise tax payment for entities below threshold** — only the No Tax Due Report filing
- **Public Information Report (PIR):** Must be filed annually with the franchise tax report. Lists registered agent, principal office, officers/directors/managers.
- **Secretary of State:** No annual report filing fee in Texas (unlike many states). LLC maintains standing as long as franchise tax report is filed.
- **Registered agent:** Must maintain a registered agent in Texas. Failure results in administrative forfeiture.

### Forfeiture risk

If a Texas LLC fails to file the franchise tax report (even the No Tax Due Report):
- Texas Comptroller notifies the entity
- After notice period, Comptroller certifies forfeiture to Secretary of State
- Secretary of State forfeits the entity's right to transact business
- Reinstatement requires filing all delinquent reports + paying penalties and fees
- Flag for reviewer if any prior filings were missed

## Section 5 — Refusals

**R-TX-1 — Upstream skill did not run.** Name the specific skill.

**R-TX-2 — Revenue exceeds $2.47M and margin computation is complex.** If COGS includes items requiring IRC §263A UNICAP analysis or compensation includes complex benefit allocations, flag for franchise tax specialist.

**R-TX-3 — Multi-state apportionment needed.** If the entity has receipts from customers outside Texas and performs services in multiple states, Texas apportionment factor requires analysis. Flag for reviewer.

**R-TX-4 — Sales tax audit or dispute.** If the taxpayer has received a sales tax audit notice or is in dispute with the Comptroller, refuse and recommend sales tax attorney.

**R-TX-5 — Combined group reporting.** If the SMLLC is part of a combined group for Texas franchise tax purposes, refuse. Combined group reporting requires specialized computation.
