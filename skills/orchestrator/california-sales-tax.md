## Section 2 -- Required inputs and refusal catalogue

### Required inputs

**Required inputs**

| # | Question | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | California Seller's Permit number? | Required for filing; confirms registration with CDTFA |
| 2 | Assigned filing frequency (monthly, quarterly, annual)? | Determines return due dates and prepayment requirements |
| 3 | Nexus type (physical, economic, both)? | $500,000 threshold for economic nexus |
| 4 | Sell through marketplace facilitators (Amazon, eBay, Etsy)? | Marketplace facilitators collect on facilitated sales |
| 5 | Primary business address / point of sale location? | Needed for district tax rate determination on counter sales |
| 6 | Ship goods to California customers? From where? | Destination-based sourcing for district taxes |
| 7 | Sell food, software/SaaS, or manufacturing equipment? | Special exemption or taxability rules |
| 8 | Average monthly tax liability exceed $17,000? | Prepayments due 24th of first and second month of quarter |

- **Stop condition** — If the client cannot answer questions 1-3, STOP and gather this information before proceeding.

### Refusal catalogue

- **R-CA-1** — Cannabis taxation. Cannabis excise tax and cultivation tax have separate compliance requirements outside this skill. Escalate to a licensed tax professional.

## Section 8 -- Edge cases

### EC1 -- SaaS vs. downloaded software

**Situation:** Business purchases software that is partly cloud-based and partly downloaded.

**Resolution:** If the software requires a download or local installation, the downloaded component is taxable as TPP. If purely accessed through a browser with no download, it is not taxable. Hybrid products require analysis of the primary function.

### EC2 -- Fabrication labor vs. repair labor

**Situation:** A shop builds a custom metal part for a customer.

**Resolution:** Fabrication labor (creating a new product to customer specifications) is TAXABLE under R&TC Section 6006(b). Repair labor (fixing an existing item) is NOT taxable if separately stated from parts. The distinction is whether a new product is being created.

### EC3 -- Manufacturing partial exemption

**Situation:** Manufacturer purchases a $100,000 machine used 60% for manufacturing, 40% for administration.

**Resolution:** Qualifies for partial exemption because manufacturing use exceeds 50%. The state portion is partially exempted. Full district tax still applies at the delivery location rate.

### EC4 -- Food: grocery vs. prepared

**Situation:** Bakery sells cold sandwiches and hot soup from the same counter.

**Resolution:** Cold sandwiches sold without eating utensils provided by the seller are EXEMPT as grocery food. Hot soup is TAXABLE as prepared food. Each item classified separately. If the seller provides eating utensils, all food becomes taxable.

### EC5 -- Drop shipments

**Situation:** Out-of-state retailer directs a California manufacturer to ship to a California customer.

**Resolution:** The California manufacturer must collect tax unless the retailer provides a valid resale certificate. If the retailer is not registered in California, the manufacturer should collect tax on the retail price. Complex area requiring careful certificate management.

## Section 9 -- Test suite

### Test 1 -- Basic taxable sale in Los Angeles

**Input:** Retailer sells a $1,000 TV in Los Angeles using a July-Sept. 2025 CDTFA city-table example rate of 9.750% (confirm exact address/date).
**Expected:** Tax = $97.50. Total = $1,097.50.

### Test 2 -- Grocery food exempt

**Input:** Customer purchases $200 of cold groceries (produce, dairy, bread) at a supermarket.
**Expected:** Tax = $0. Grocery food is exempt.

### Test 3 -- SaaS not taxable

**Input:** San Francisco business subscribes to cloud-based project management tool. $150/month. No download.
**Expected:** Not taxable. Pure SaaS without download is not TPP in California.

### Test 4 -- Economic nexus

**Input:** Oregon-based online seller has $600,000 in California-delivery tangible merchandise sales in the current calendar year. No physical presence. 50 transactions.
**Expected:** Exceeds the $500,000 revenue threshold. Must register with CDTFA and collect California use tax/statewide rate plus applicable district taxes for California deliveries.

### Test 5 -- Clothing fully taxable

**Input:** Customer buys a $300 jacket in San Francisco. Rate: 8.625%.
**Expected:** Tax = $25.88. No clothing exemption in California.

### Test 6 -- Resale certificate

**Input:** Retailer purchases $15,000 of inventory from a CA wholesaler. Provides valid CDTFA-230.
**Expected:** No tax. Retailer collects tax at point of resale.

### Test 7 -- Use tax on out-of-state purchase

**Input:** Los Angeles business purchases $5,000 of office furniture from an Oregon retailer. No tax collected. Use the July-Sept. 2025 Los Angeles city-table example rate of 9.750% unless the exact address/date lookup says otherwise.
**Expected:** Use tax = $487.50 ($5,000 x 9.750%).

### Test 8 -- Hot prepared food

**Input:** Customer buys a $12 hot meal from a deli counter in Sacramento. Rate: 8.75%.
**Expected:** Tax = $1.05. Hot prepared food is taxable.

### Test 9 -- Manufacturing equipment partial exemption

**Input:** Manufacturer purchases a $200,000 production machine in San Jose. Used 100% in manufacturing.
**Expected:** Partial exemption applies to state portion. District tax still applies. Effective tax rate is reduced compared to full combined rate.

### Test 10 -- Canned software download

**Input:** Business purchases a $500 canned software license via electronic download in San Diego. Rate: 7.75%.
**Expected:** Tax = $38.75. Downloaded canned software is taxable as TPP.

## Section 10 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply a clothing exemption in California -- clothing is fully taxable at all times.
- NEVER treat pure SaaS (cloud-only, no download) as taxable -- California has not extended sales tax to pure SaaS.
- NEVER confuse fabrication labor (taxable) with repair labor (not taxable if separately stated).
- NEVER forget district taxes -- the 7.25% statewide rate is only the minimum; use the CDTFA address lookup because local rates can change during the year.
- NEVER use origin-based sourcing for district taxes -- California is destination-based for district taxes.
- NEVER assume the manufacturing partial exemption fully eliminates tax -- it reduces the state portion but district taxes still apply.
- NEVER accept SST certificates in California -- CA is not an SST member.
- NEVER forget the prepayment requirement for sellers with average monthly liability over $17,000.
- NEVER treat OTC drugs as exempt -- only prescription medicine is exempt in California.
- NEVER compute any number -- all arithmetic is handled by the deterministic engine, not Claude.
