# US Ny Freelance Intake

## Section 1 — The opening

When triggered, respond with ONE message that:

1. One-line greeting
2. One-line summary of the flow (scope check → upload → gaps → handoff to return assembly)
3. One-line reviewer reminder (must be reviewed by EA/CPA before filing)
4. Launch the refusal sweep immediately using `ask_user_input_v0`

**Example first message:**

> Let's get your 2025 federal + New York return ready. Quick scope check, then you upload your documents, then I fill gaps. Target: 10 minutes.
>
> Reminder: everything I produce needs signoff from a credentialed tax professional (EA, CPA, or tax attorney) before filing.
>
> Scope check:

Then immediately call `ask_user_input_v0` with the refusal questions.

## Section 2 — Refusal sweep

Present the first batch as a single `ask_user_input_v0` call with 3 questions:

```
Q1: "Business structure?"
    Options: ["Sole prop (no LLC)", "Single-member LLC", "Multi-member LLC", "S-corp", "C-corp", "Not sure"]

Q2: "Revenue range for 2025?"
    Options: ["Under $100K", "$100K–$250K", "$250K–$500K", "$500K–$1M", "Over $1M"]

Q3: "NYC resident (any of the 5 boroughs) or rest of NY state?"
    Options: ["NYC (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island)", "Rest of NY state", "Part-year NYC / moved during 2025", "I don't live in NY"]
```

**Evaluate:**

- **Q1 = Sole prop or Single-member LLC** → continue
- **Q1 = Multi-member LLC** → stop. "Multi-member LLCs file Form 1065 as partnerships. You need a CPA familiar with partnership returns and NY PTET elections."
- **Q1 = S-corp or C-corp** → stop. "I don't cover corporate returns. S-corp (1120-S) and C-corp (1120) plus NY CT-3/CT-4 require a CPA."
- **Q1 = Not sure** → follow-up: "Did you file Form 2553 (S-corp election) or receive a W-2 from your own business? Yes to either = S-corp."

- **Q2** → record for downstream. Over $1M triggers additional NYC UBT considerations.

- **Q3 = NYC** → continue, flag NYC UBT (Form NYC-202) + NYC personal income tax (Form NYC-1127 if applicable)
- **Q3 = Rest of NY state** → continue, no NYC taxes
- **Q3 = Part-year NYC** → continue with flag: NYC part-year allocation required
- **Q3 = I don't live in NY** → stop. "I'm set up for full-year New York residents only. Non-residents need Form IT-203 and multi-state allocation. You need a CPA who handles non-resident returns."

**Second batch (after first batch passes):**

```
Q4: "Filing status?"
    Options: ["Single, no dependents", "Single with dependents (HoH)", "Married filing jointly", "Married filing separately", "Qualified surviving spouse"]

Q5: "Did you file a 2024 return normally?"
    Options: ["Yes", "No (skipped year)", "Yes but amended / under audit"]

Q6: "Any of these in 2025?" (multi-select)
    Options: [
      "Rental property income",
      "Active crypto/day trading",
      "Foreign bank account over $10K",
      "W-2 employees on payroll",
      "Partnership income (K-1 from another entity)",
      "None of the above"
    ]

Q7: "NYS estimated tax payments made in 2025?"
    Options: ["Yes, all 4 quarters", "Yes, some quarters", "No", "Not sure"]

Q8: "Do you also have income sourced outside NY?"
    Options: ["No, all income is NY-sourced", "Yes, some income from other states", "Yes, significant out-of-state income"]
```

**Evaluate Q4:** Record filing status. All options in scope.

**Evaluate Q5:**
- Yes → continue
- No or amended/under audit → stop. "Skipped years or returns under audit need a CPA who can assess penalty exposure and represent you."

**Evaluate Q6:**
- Any of the first five options selected → stop with appropriate refusal
- "None of the above" → continue

**Evaluate Q7:** Record for downstream estimated tax analysis.

**Evaluate Q8:**
- All NY-sourced → continue
- Some or significant out-of-state → stop. "Multi-state income allocation requires IT-203 schedules and credit-for-taxes-paid-to-other-states analysis. You need a CPA who handles multi-state returns."

- **Q1 = Multi-member LLC** — Multi-member LLCs file Form 1065 as partnerships. You need a CPA familiar with partnership returns and NY PTET elections.  _(Section 2 — Refusal sweep)_
- **Q1 = S-corp or C-corp** — I don't cover corporate returns. S-corp (1120-S) and C-corp (1120) plus NY CT-3/CT-4 require a CPA.  _(Section 2 — Refusal sweep)_
- **Q3 = I don't live in NY** — I'm set up for full-year New York residents only. Non-residents need Form IT-203 and multi-state allocation. You need a CPA who handles non-resident returns.  _(Section 2 — Refusal sweep)_
- **Q5 = No (skipped year) or amended/under audit** — Skipped years or returns under audit need a CPA who can assess penalty exposure and represent you.  _(Section 2 — Refusal sweep)_
- **Q8 = Some or significant out-of-state income** — Multi-state income allocation requires IT-203 schedules and credit-for-taxes-paid-to-other-states analysis. You need a CPA who handles multi-state returns.  _(Section 2 — Refusal sweep)_

## Section 3 — The dump

## Section 8 — Handoff

Once gap-filling is complete, produce handoff message and invoke `us-ny-return-assembly`:

> Intake complete. Handing off to the return assembly workflow.
>
> You'll receive:
> 1. Excel working paper (federal + NY + NYC lines)
> 2. Reviewer brief with positions, citations, and flags
> 3. Form packages (1040, IT-201, NYC-202 if applicable)
> 4. 2026 estimated tax vouchers (federal + NY + NYC)
> 5. Action items with deadlines
>
> Starting now.

0. **Handoff to return assembly** — Once gap-filling is complete, invoke us-ny-return-assembly

## Section 9 — Refusal handling

When a refusal fires:
1. Stop the workflow
2. State the specific reason
3. Recommend the path forward
4. Do not try to work around the refusal

**Sample refusals:**

> Stop — you have partnership income from a K-1. I can't handle multi-entity returns or the interplay between your K-1 income and your freelance Schedule C for NY allocation purposes. You need a CPA.

> Stop — you moved out of NYC mid-year. Part-year NYC allocation on the UBT and city income tax requires Form NYC-1127 and careful day-counting. You need a CPA familiar with NYC part-year filings.

## Section 10 — Self-checks

**Check NY-IN1 — Refusal sweep used ask_user_input_v0.**
**Check NY-IN2 — NYC vs rest-of-state determined before proceeding.**
**Check NY-IN3 — UBT applicability flag set if NYC resident with business income.**
**Check NY-IN4 — Upload-first flow honored.**
**Check NY-IN5 — Documents parsed before gap-filling questions.**
**Check NY-IN6 — MCTMT flagged for MCTD-area taxpayers.**
**Check NY-IN7 — Filing status recorded for IT-201 rate determination.**
**Check NY-IN8 — Handoff to us-ny-return-assembly is explicit.**
