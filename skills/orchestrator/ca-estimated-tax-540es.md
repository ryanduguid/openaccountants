# CA Estimated Tax 540es

## CA Estimated Tax 540-ES Skill v0.2

## What this file is, and what it is not

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of `us-tax-workflow-base` v0.1.** It provides the California estimated tax payment rules for individual taxpayers who are full-year California residents with self-employment income for tax year 2025. California uses a unique 30/40/0/30 installment schedule that differs significantly from the federal equal-quarterly system.

**This skill does NOT compute California income tax** (handled by `ca-540-individual-return`). It takes the total CA tax liability as an input and determines the required estimated payments, safe harbor amounts, and any underpayment penalty.

**Critical distinction from federal.** Federal estimated tax uses equal 25% quarterly installments. California uses 30%/40%/0%/30%. Getting this wrong causes underpayment penalties. This is the single most important fact in this skill.

## Section 1 -- Scope statement

This skill covers California Form 540-ES and related underpayment penalty analysis for tax year 2025 for taxpayers who are:

- Full-year California residents
- Sole proprietors or single-member LLC owners with self-employment income
- Required to make estimated tax payments to the California Franchise Tax Board (FTB)

For the following kinds of work:

- Determining whether estimated tax payments are required
- Computing the required annual payment
- Allocating payments across the 30/40/0/30 installment schedule
- Computing underpayment penalties (Form 5805)
- Reconciling withholding credits against estimated tax obligations
- Producing the 2026 prospective estimated tax payment schedule

This skill does NOT cover:

- California income tax computation -- handled by `ca-540-individual-return`
- Federal estimated tax -- handled by `us-quarterly-estimated-tax`
- SMLLC $800 franchise tax or LLC fee payments -- handled by `ca-smllc-form-568`
- Corporate estimated tax (Form 100-ES)
- Nonresident estimated tax

## Section 2 -- Year coverage and currency

**Tax year covered:** 2025 (estimated payments made during 2025; return filed in 2026).

**Currency date:** April 2026.

**Legislation reflected:**
- R&TC section 19136 -- requirement to pay estimated tax
- R&TC section 19136.1 -- installment schedule (30/40/0/30)
- R&TC section 19136.5 -- safe harbor rules
- R&TC section 19142 -- underpayment penalty

### Installment schedule

**Installment schedule**  _(R&TC section 19136.1)_

**Installment schedule**  _([R&TC section 19136.1](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html))_

| Installment | Due date (calendar year) | Percentage of required annual payment | Cumulative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | April 15, 2025 | 30% | 30% |
| Q2 | June 16, 2025 | 40% | 70% |
| Q3 | September 15, 2025 | 0% (no payment due) | 70% |
| Q4 | January 15, 2026 | 30% | 100% |

**Note:** There is NO September 15 payment for California. This is the most common error. Taxpayers who autopay equal quarterly amounts overpay in Q1 and Q2 and skip Q3.

### Safe harbor rules

**Safe harbor rules**  _([R&TC section 19136.5](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html))_

| Rule | Threshold | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current-year safe harbor | Pay 90% of current year's CA tax liability | R&TC section 19136.5 |
| Prior-year safe harbor | Pay 100% of prior year's CA tax liability, unless the 110% high-income rule applies | R&TC section 19136.5 |
| Prior-year safe harbor (high income) | If 2024 CA AGI > $150,000 ($75,000 MFS): use 110% of 2024 CA tax liability, unless the 2025 $1M/$500K current-year high-income rule applies | 2025 Form 540-ES / Form 5805 instructions |
| Current-year high-income rule | If 2025 CA AGI is $1,000,000 or more ($500,000 MFS), use 90% of 2025 tax; prior-year safe harbor is unavailable | 2025 Form 540-ES / Form 5805 instructions |

**High-income rules resolved for 2025:** If 2024 CA AGI was more than $150,000 ($75,000 MFS), use 110% of 2024 tax instead of 100% for the prior-year safe harbor. If 2025 CA AGI is $1,000,000 or more ($500,000 MFS), the taxpayer must base estimated tax on 90% of 2025 tax; the prior-year safe harbor is not available.

## Section 5 -- Determining whether estimated tax is required

### 5.1 -- General rule

- **General rule for estimated tax requirement** — A taxpayer must make estimated tax payments if: 1) they expect to owe at least $500 ($250 if married/RDP filing separately) in CA tax after subtracting withholding and credits, AND 2) they expect withholding and credits to be less than the applicable required annual payment: generally the lesser of 90% of 2025 tax or 100% of 2024 tax; 110% of 2024 tax if 2024 CA AGI exceeded $150,000 ($75,000 MFS); or 90% of 2025 tax if 2025 CA AGI is $1,000,000 or more ($500,000 MFS).  _([R&TC section 19136](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html))_

### 5.2 -- Who typically must pay

- Self-employed individuals (Schedule C income)
- Taxpayers with significant investment income
- Taxpayers with income not subject to CA withholding
- Partners and S-corp shareholders (K-1 income)

### 5.3 -- Who may be exempt

- Taxpayers whose CA tax liability after withholding and credits is below $500 ($250 if MFS)
- New California residents with no prior-year CA return (but see 5.4)
- Farmers and fishermen (special rules under R&TC section 19136.2 -- single installment due January 15)

### 5.4 -- First year in California

- **First year in California rule** — If the taxpayer had no CA tax liability in the prior year (e.g., new CA resident), the prior-year safe harbor is $0 (no prior-year tax). The taxpayer must use the 90% current-year method. **Flag for reviewer.**  _(R&TC section 19136.5)_

## Section 6 -- The 30/40/0/30 installment schedule (detailed)

### 6.1 -- How it works

**6.1 -- How it works**  _([R&TC section 19136.1](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html))_

| Installment | Percentage | Due date | What to pay |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 30% | April 15, 2025 | 30% of the required annual payment |
| 2nd | 40% | June 16, 2025 | 40% of the required annual payment |
| 3rd | 0% | September 15, 2025 | $0 (no payment required) |
| 4th | 30% | January 15, 2026 | 30% of the required annual payment |

### 6.2 -- Required annual payment

- **Required annual payment formula** — The required annual payment is generally the lesser of 90% of 2025 CA tax or 100% of 2024 CA tax. Use 110% of 2024 tax if 2024 CA AGI exceeded $150,000 ($75,000 MFS). If 2025 CA AGI is $1,000,000 or more ($500,000 MFS), use 90% of 2025 tax; prior-year safe harbor is unavailable.  _([R&TC section 19136.5](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-5805-instructions.html))_

### 6.3 -- Example computation

Prior year CA tax = $10,000. Current year expected CA tax = $12,000.

Required annual payment = lesser of:
- 90% x $12,000 = $10,800
- 100% x $10,000 = $10,000

Required annual payment = $10,000.

**Example computation table**  _(https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html)_

| Installment | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Q1 (April 15) | $10,000 x 30% = $3,000 |
| Q2 (June 16) | $10,000 x 40% = $4,000 |
| Q3 (September 15) | $0 |
| Q4 (January 15) | $10,000 x 30% = $3,000 |

### 6.4 -- Withholding credit application

- **Withholding credit application** — If the taxpayer also has W-2 wages with CA withholding: W-2 withholding is treated as paid ratably over the year (equally across all 4 quarters), regardless of when it was actually withheld. Reduce each installment's required payment by 1/4 of the annual withholding. If total withholding meets the safe harbor, no estimated payments are needed.  _(R&TC section 19136.5)_

### 6.5 -- Backup withholding

- **Backup withholding treatment** — Backup withholding (7% on 1099 payments) is also treated as paid ratably. It reduces estimated tax obligations.  _(R&TC section 19136.5)_

## Section 7 -- Underpayment penalty computation (Form 5805)

### 7.1 -- When the penalty applies

- **When penalty applies** — A penalty applies if: The taxpayer underpaid any installment relative to its required amount, AND No exception applies (Section 7.3). The penalty is computed as INTEREST on each underpayment from the installment due date to the earlier of: The date the underpayment was cured (paid), or April 15, 2026 (the return due date)  _(R&TC section 19142)_

### 7.2 -- Penalty computation steps

- **Penalty computation steps** — For each installment: 1. Determine the required payment (30% / 40% / 0% / 30% of required annual payment). 2. Subtract withholding credit allocated to that quarter (1/4 of annual withholding). 3. Subtract estimated payments actually made by the due date. 4. If the result is positive, that is the underpayment for that installment. 5. Compute interest on the underpayment at the FTB's quarterly rate from the due date to April 15, 2026 (or earlier payment date).  _(R&TC section 19142)_

### 7.3 -- Exceptions to penalty

**Exceptions to penalty**  _([R&TC section 19144](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-5805-instructions.html))_

| Exception | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Tax liability under threshold | No penalty if total tax after withholding/credits is less than $500, or less than $250 if MFS |
| No prior-year liability | If 2024 CA tax was $0 (12-month return), no penalty for 2025 underpayment |
| Casualty/disaster | FTB may waive penalty for taxpayers in federally declared disaster areas |
| Annualized income method | Taxpayer can use Schedule AI on Form 5805 to demonstrate income was earned unevenly throughout the year and payments matched income timing |

### 7.4 -- Annualized income installment method

- **Annualized income installment method** — If income was earned unevenly (e.g., large contract paid in Q4), the taxpayer can use the annualized income installment method on Schedule AI (Form 5805): 1. Compute CA taxable income for each cumulative period (Jan-Mar, Jan-May, Jan-Aug, Jan-Dec). 2. Annualize each period's income. 3. Compute tax on the annualized income. 4. Determine the required installment based on annualized tax. 5. This may reduce or eliminate the penalty for early installments when income was low.  _(FTB Form 5805 (2025))_

## Section 8 -- Interaction with federal estimated tax

### 8.1 -- Separate systems

- **Separate systems** — California estimated tax and federal estimated tax are completely independent: Separate computations, Separate payment methods (FTB Web Pay vs. IRS EFTPS/Direct Pay), Separate safe harbors, Different installment schedules (CA 30/40/0/30 vs. federal 25/25/25/25)

### 8.2 -- Common errors

**Common errors**

| Error | Why it happens | Correct approach |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Paying equal quarters to CA | Taxpayer assumes CA matches federal | Use 30/40/0/30 |
| Skipping CA Q1 because federal Q1 was paid | Confusing the two systems | Pay both on April 15 |
| Using federal safe harbor for CA | Different rules | Compute CA safe harbor separately |
| Sending CA payment to IRS | Wrong payee | CA goes to FTB; federal goes to IRS |

### 8.3 -- Consolidated payment calendar (for taxpayer action list)

**Consolidated payment calendar**  _(https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-540-es-instructions.html)_

| Date | Federal payment | CA payment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| April 15, 2025 | 25% of federal required | 30% of CA required |
| June 16, 2025 | 25% of federal required | 40% of CA required |
| September 15, 2025 | 25% of federal required | $0 |
| January 15, 2026 | 25% of federal required | 30% of CA required |

## Section 9 -- PROHIBITIONS

- **P-ES-1** — NEVER use equal 25% quarterly installments for California estimated tax. California uses 30/40/0/30. This is the most critical prohibition in this skill.
- **P-ES-2** — NEVER tell the taxpayer to make a California estimated tax payment on September 15. The Q3 California installment is $0.
- **P-ES-3** — NEVER combine federal and California estimated tax into a single payment. They go to different agencies (IRS vs. FTB) with different methods.
- **P-ES-4** — NEVER apply a flat 100% prior-year safe harbor for high-income California taxpayers. If 2024 CA AGI exceeded $150,000 ($75,000 MFS), use 110% of 2024 tax; if 2025 CA AGI is $1,000,000 or more ($500,000 MFS), use 90% of 2025 tax.  _(https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2025/2025-5805-instructions.html)_
- **P-ES-5** — NEVER ignore withholding credits when computing estimated tax. W-2 withholding and backup withholding reduce the estimated tax obligation.
- **P-ES-6** — NEVER assume the farmer/fisherman exception applies automatically. It requires that at least 2/3 of gross income comes from farming or fishing.
- **P-ES-7** — NEVER confuse Form 540-ES (individual estimated tax) with Form 3522 (LLC franchise tax) or Form 3536 (LLC fee estimate). These are separate obligations with separate due dates.
- **P-ES-8** — NEVER skip the underpayment penalty analysis. Even if the taxpayer paid some estimated tax, they may have underpaid specific installments under the 30/40/0/30 schedule.

## Section 10 -- Edge Cases

### EC-ES-1 -- Taxpayer pays equal quarters by mistake

**Situation:** Taxpayer's required annual payment is $20,000. They pay $5,000 on April 15, $5,000 on June 16, $5,000 on September 15, $5,000 on January 15.

**Resolution:**
- Required: Q1 = $6,000 (30%), Q2 = $8,000 (40%), Q3 = $0, Q4 = $6,000 (30%).
- Paid: Q1 = $5,000, Q2 = $5,000, Q3 = $5,000, Q4 = $5,000.
- Underpayment: Q1 = $1,000 (underpaid), Q2 = $3,000 (underpaid), Q3 = $0 (overpaid, no penalty but no credit applied retroactively to Q1/Q2), Q4 = $1,000 (underpaid).
- Penalty: interest computed on $1,000 from April 15, on $3,000 from June 16, and on $1,000 from January 15, each to April 15, 2026.
- Form 5805 applies payments to earlier underpayment balances first; the September payment cannot retroactively erase Q1/Q2 penalties but may be applied before later-period underpayments.

### EC-ES-2 -- New California resident, no prior-year CA tax

**Situation:** Taxpayer moved to California on January 1, 2025. No 2024 CA return. Expected 2025 CA tax = $15,000.

**Resolution:**
- Prior-year safe harbor: $0 (no prior CA tax).
- Cannot rely on 100% of prior-year tax (that would be $0, which is insufficient).
- Must use 90% current-year method: 90% x $15,000 = $13,500.
- Required annual payment: $13,500.
- Q1 = $4,050, Q2 = $5,400, Q3 = $0, Q4 = $4,050.
- **Flag for reviewer:** New residents must carefully estimate current-year tax since the prior-year safe harbor is unavailable.

### EC-ES-3 -- Income spike in Q4

**Situation:** Freelancer earns $30,000 in Q1-Q3 combined, then receives a $120,000 contract payment in November. Total 2025 CA tax is $18,000. Prior-year CA tax was $5,000.

**Resolution:**
- Prior-year safe harbor: 100% x $5,000 = $5,000, assuming the 110% prior-year and $1M current-year high-income rules do not apply. This is the required annual payment (less than 90% x $18,000 = $16,200).
- Q1 = $1,500, Q2 = $2,000, Q3 = $0, Q4 = $1,500.
- If the taxpayer paid $1,500 / $2,000 / $0 / $1,500, the safe harbor is met. No penalty even though actual tax is $18,000.
- Remaining $13,000 ($18,000 - $5,000) is due with the return on April 15, 2026.
- Alternatively, the taxpayer can use the annualized income method to reduce even the safe harbor amounts for early quarters.
- Confirm whether the 110% prior-year or $1M/$500K current-year high-income rule applies before relying on this example.

### EC-ES-4 -- W-2 withholding covers most of the tax

**Situation:** Taxpayer has W-2 job (CA withholding $12,000 annually) and side Schedule C business. Total CA tax = $15,000.

**Resolution:**
- Required annual payment: lesser of 90% x $15,000 = $13,500 or 100% of prior year tax.
- Withholding credit: $12,000 / 4 = $3,000 per quarter (allocated ratably).
- Net required estimated payment per installment:
  - Q1: 30% x $13,500 - $3,000 = $4,050 - $3,000 = $1,050
  - Q2: 40% x $13,500 - $3,000 = $5,400 - $3,000 = $2,400
  - Q3: 0% x $13,500 - $3,000 = -$3,000 (no payment needed, credit applied)
  - Q4: 30% x $13,500 - $3,000 = $4,050 - $3,000 = $1,050
- If withholding alone meets the prior-year safe harbor, no estimated payments needed.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Verify whether W-2 withholding alone meets safe harbor.

### EC-ES-5 -- Farmer/fisherman exception

**Situation:** Taxpayer earns 70% of gross income from farming. Total CA tax = $8,000.

**Resolution:**
- Qualifies for farmer/fisherman exception (at least 2/3 of gross income from farming/fishing).
- Single installment due January 15, 2026 (100% of required payment).
- OR file return and pay full tax by March 1, 2026 -- no penalty.
- The 30/40/0/30 schedule does NOT apply to qualifying farmers/fishermen.
- Verify the 2/3 gross income test. If the taxpayer does not qualify, the regular 30/40/0/30 schedule applies.

### EC-ES-6 -- Disaster area relief

**Situation:** Taxpayer's home is in a county declared a disaster area by the Governor. FTB announces extended deadlines.

**Resolution:**
- Check FTB disaster relief announcements for the specific disaster.
- Estimated tax due dates may be extended (e.g., Q1 due April 15 extended to October 15).
- The penalty is waived or reduced for the extended period.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Verify the specific disaster relief provisions and extended dates.

### EC-ES-7 -- Taxpayer overpays Q1 and Q2

**Situation:** Taxpayer's required annual payment is $10,000. They pay $5,000 on April 15 and $5,000 on June 16 (total $10,000 by Q2). Nothing in Q3 or Q4.

**Resolution:**
- Required: Q1 = $3,000 (30%), Q2 = $4,000 (40%), Q3 = $0, Q4 = $3,000 (30%).
- Cumulative: After Q1 paid $5,000 (required $3,000 -- overpaid $2,000). After Q2 paid $10,000 cumulative (required $7,000 cumulative -- overpaid $3,000).
- Q4 required $3,000 -- but cumulative payments already exceed $10,000 total required. No underpayment.
- No penalty. The overpayment from Q1/Q2 carries forward to satisfy Q4.

### EC-ES-8 -- MFS with different income levels

**Situation:** Married couple filing separately for CA. Spouse A has CA tax of $20,000. Spouse B has CA tax of $3,000.

**Resolution:**
- Each spouse computes estimated tax independently.
- Spouse A: required annual payment based on Spouse A's tax. Apply 30/40/0/30.
- Spouse B: if tax after withholding and credits is less than $250, no estimated payments required for MFS.
- Joint payments from prior years must be allocated between spouses.
- **Flag for reviewer:** Verify allocation of prior-year payments and withholding between spouses.

## Section 11 -- Test Suite

### Test ES-1 -- Basic 30/40/0/30 computation

**Input:** Prior year CA tax = $8,000. Current year CA tax = $10,000. No withholding.
**Expected:** Required annual payment = lesser of $9,000 (90% current) or $8,000 (100% prior) = $8,000. Q1 = $2,400, Q2 = $3,200, Q3 = $0, Q4 = $2,400.

### Test ES-2 -- Equal-quarter error detection

**Input:** Required annual payment = $12,000. Taxpayer paid $3,000 each quarter (April 15, June 16, September 15, January 15).
**Expected:** Required: Q1 $3,600, Q2 $4,800, Q3 $0, Q4 $3,600. Underpayment: Q1 $600, Q2 $1,800, Q3 none, Q4 $600. Penalty = interest on each underpayment from due date to April 15, 2026.

### Test ES-3 -- Withholding offsets estimated tax

**Input:** Total CA tax = $16,000. Prior year tax = $14,000. W-2 withholding = $14,000.
**Expected:** Required annual payment = $14,000. Withholding per quarter = $3,500. Net required: Q1 = $4,200 - $3,500 = $700, Q2 = $5,600 - $3,500 = $2,100, Q3 = $0 - $3,500 = -$3,500 (no payment), Q4 = $4,200 - $3,500 = $700.

### Test ES-4 -- No prior-year CA tax

**Input:** New CA resident. No 2024 CA tax. Expected 2025 CA tax = $20,000. No withholding.
**Expected:** Required annual payment = 90% x $20,000 = $18,000 (prior-year safe harbor is $0, does not help). Q1 = $5,400, Q2 = $7,200, Q3 = $0, Q4 = $5,400.

### Test ES-5 -- Prior-year safe harbor satisfied, current year much higher

**Input:** Prior year CA tax = $6,000. Current year CA tax = $25,000. Taxpayer paid: Q1 $1,800, Q2 $2,400, Q3 $0, Q4 $1,800. Total paid = $6,000.
**Expected:** Required annual payment = lesser of $22,500 (90% current) or $6,000 (100% prior) = $6,000. Q1 required $1,800 (30%), Q2 required $2,400 (40%), Q3 $0, Q4 $1,800 (30%). All installments met. No penalty. Balance due of $19,000 with return.

### Test ES-6 -- Consolidated federal + CA payment calendar

**Input:** Federal required estimated = $16,000. CA required estimated = $10,000.
**Expected:** Payment calendar:
- April 15: Federal $4,000 (25%) + CA $3,000 (30%) = $7,000 total
- June 16: Federal $4,000 (25%) + CA $4,000 (40%) = $8,000 total
- September 15: Federal $4,000 (25%) + CA $0 (0%) = $4,000 total
- January 15: Federal $4,000 (25%) + CA $3,000 (30%) = $7,000 total

## Section 12 -- Self-checks

**Check 250 -- 30/40/0/30 schedule used.** Verify that California installment percentages are 30/40/0/30, not 25/25/25/25.

**Check 251 -- No September 15 CA payment.** Verify that the Q3 CA installment is $0 and no payment was scheduled or recommended for September 15.

**Check 252 -- Safe harbor computed correctly.** Verify that the required annual payment uses the lesser of 90% current-year or 100% (or 110%) prior-year.

**Check 253 -- Withholding credited ratably.** If the taxpayer has W-2 withholding, verify it is allocated equally across all 4 quarters.

**Check 254 -- Federal and CA payments are separate.** Verify the taxpayer action list shows separate payment amounts to IRS (EFTPS/Direct Pay) and FTB (Web Pay).

**Check 255 -- Underpayment penalty computed if applicable.** If any installment was underpaid, verify Form 5805 penalty computation.

**Check 256 -- Annualized income method considered.** If income was uneven across quarters, verify whether the annualized income method reduces or eliminates the penalty.

**Check 257 -- Farmer/fisherman exception evaluated.** If the taxpayer has farming/fishing income, verify whether the 2/3 gross income test is met.

**Check 258 -- 2026 prospective schedule produced.** Verify the output includes a 2026 estimated tax payment schedule using the 30/40/0/30 allocation.

**Check 259 -- Form 540-ES vs. Form 3522/3536 not confused.** Verify that 540-ES (personal estimated tax) is not conflated with Form 3522 (LLC $800) or Form 3536 (LLC fee estimate).

## Section 13 -- Cross-skill references

**Inputs from:**
- `ca-540-individual-return` -- total CA tax liability for safe harbor and required annual payment
- `us-quarterly-estimated-tax` -- federal estimated tax amounts for consolidated calendar
- Prior-year CA return -- prior-year CA tax for safe harbor

**Outputs to:**
- `us-ca-return-assembly` -- Form 540-ES payment schedule, Form 5805 penalty, 2026 prospective schedule, consolidated payment calendar

## Section 14 -- Known gaps

1. FTB underpayment interest rates change by rate period; use Form 5805 and current FTB rates at filing time.
2. 3. Disaster area deadline extensions are fact-specific and not embedded in this skill.
4. The annualized income installment method computation is outlined but not fully detailed step-by-step.
5. Part-year resident estimated tax allocation is not covered.
