## Section 10 -- Prohibitions

- NEVER apply a general clothing exemption -- clothing is taxable except during the Sales Tax Holiday.
- NEVER assume all services are taxable -- Texas taxes only enumerated services.
- NEVER forget the 20% data processing exemption on SaaS.
- NEVER confuse motor vehicle sales tax (TxDMV) with general sales tax (Comptroller).
- NEVER apply destination-based sourcing for intrastate Texas sales -- Texas is origin-based for intrastate.
- NEVER assume nonprofits are automatically exempt -- must have Comptroller-issued exemption number.
- NEVER exclude exempt or resale sales from the Texas remote-seller $500,000 safe-harbor calculation; Comptroller guidance counts total Texas revenue, including taxable and nontaxable sales into Texas.
- NEVER file without claiming the timely filing discount if eligible.
- NEVER treat residential and nonresidential real property services the same.
- NEVER compute any number -- all arithmetic is handled by the deterministic engine, not Claude.
