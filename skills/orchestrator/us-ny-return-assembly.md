Handles reconciliation between federal AGI and NY AGI adjustments, NY itemized vs standard deduction election, NYC income tax surcharge, NYC UBT credit against personal income tax, and MCTMT computation. New York full-year residents only.

# US Ny Return Assembly

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, you have already passed through intake. The user has consented to the full workflow. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

- Do NOT ask "how deep do you want me to go" or "do you want the full package." Produce it.
- Do NOT announce token counts or tool calls.
- Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize. Produce all deliverables listed in Section 6.
- Do NOT re-validate scope that intake already validated.
- Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.
- Self-checks are targets, not blockers. If one fails, flag it for reviewer and continue.
- If you feel the urge to ask "how should I proceed," pick the most defensible path and flag the decision in the reviewer brief.

## Section 1 — Scope

Produces the complete federal + New York filing package for:
- Full-year New York State residents (including NYC residents)
- Sole proprietors or single-member LLCs disregarded for federal tax
- Tax year 2025
- Filing Form 1040 (federal), IT-201 (NY State), NYC-202 (NYC UBT, if applicable)

- **Form 2210 penalty** — Form 2210 penalty (if applicable)
- **Total payments flow** — Total payments → Form 1040 Line 33

### New York internal consistency

- **Federal AGI starting point** — Federal AGI → IT-201 Line 19 (starting point)
- **NY additions** — NY additions (IT-201 Lines 20-23): interest income on non-NY state/local bonds, QBI deduction add-back (NY does not allow QBI deduction)
- **NY subtractions** — NY subtractions (IT-201 Lines 24-32): interest on US government obligations, NY state/local pension exclusion
- **NY AGI flow** — NY AGI → IT-201 Line 33
- **NY standard deduction** — $8,000 single / $16,050 MFJ vs NY itemized deduction (IT-201 Line 34-35)  _(IT-201 Line 34-35)_
- **NY itemized deduction limitation threshold** — 50% limitation on charitable contributions and other adjustments if NY AGI > $525,000

- **NYC UBT deductions flow** — NYC UBT deductions → Form NYC-202 Lines 2-12
- **NYC UBT taxable income flow** — NYC UBT taxable income → Form NYC-202 Line 13
- **NYC UBT exemption calculation** — $95,000, phaseout $95K-$150K USD  _(Form NYC-202 Line 14-16)_
- **UBT tax rate** — 4% (of taxable income after exemption)  _(Section 7 — NY-specific tax framework > NYC Unincorporated Business Tax (UBT) — Form NYC-202)_
- **UBT credits available** — UBT credits available → NYC-202 Line 18+
- **UBT estimated payments** — UBT estimated payments → NYC-202 Schedule F
- **UBT balance due or refund** — UBT balance due or refund

### Federal-NY coordination

- **Federal AGI as NY starting point** — Federal AGI used correctly as NY starting point
- **QBI add-back for NY** — QBI deduction properly added back for NY (NY does not conform to §199A)
- **Filing status consistency** — Filing status consistent
- **Dependents consistency** — Dependents consistent
- **NY itemized deductions basis** — NY itemized deductions use federal Schedule A as starting point but apply NY modifications: - State/local tax deduction: included for NY purposes (no $10,000 SALT cap at state level) - College tuition deduction (IT-201 Line 30): up to $10,000 per student  _(IT-201 Line 30)_
- **Depreciation conformity** — NY generally conforms to federal MACRS but has modifications for bonus depreciation (NY decoupled from 100% bonus; add-back required, then NY allows its own depreciation deduction)

### MCTMT verification

- **MCTMT threshold** — $50,000 USD (only taxed if net SE earnings in MCTD exceed $50,000)
- **MCTMT rate** — 0.34% (on net SE earnings > $50,000 allocated to MCTD)  _(Section 7 — NY-specific tax framework > Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Mobility Tax (MCTMT))_
- **Net SE earnings allocation to MCTD** — Net self-employment earnings allocated to MCTD
- **MCTMT amount flow** — MCTMT amount → Form MTA-6

### Estimated tax reconciliation

- **Federal safe harbor** — Federal: 4 quarterly payments cross-checked against safe harbor (100% prior year tax if AGI ≤ $150K, 110% if AGI > $150K)
- **NY State safe harbor** — NY State: payments on IT-2105 cross-checked against NY safe harbor (100% prior year NY tax or 90% current year)
- **UBT estimated tax quarterly payment threshold** — $3,400 USD (quarterly payments required if UBT liability expected to exceed this amount)  _(Section 7 — NY-specific tax framework > NYC Unincorporated Business Tax (UBT) — Form NYC-202)_
- **IT-2105.9 underpayment penalty** — Form IT-2105.9 (NY underpayment penalty) if applicable

### Additions to federal AGI (common for freelancers)

- **QBI deduction add-back** — NY does not allow the §199A deduction. Full federal QBI deduction amount added back on IT-225 Line 1 (code A-201)  _(IT-225 Line 1 (code A-201))_
- **Bonus depreciation add-back** — If federal return claimed bonus depreciation, NY requires add-back of the federal bonus amount, then allows NY depreciation (generally MACRS without bonus). IT-225 code A-110.  _(IT-225 code A-110)_
- **Other states' municipal bond interest** — Interest from non-NY state/local bonds is added to NY income

### Subtractions from federal AGI (common for freelancers)

- **US government obligation interest** — Interest on US Treasury securities subtracted from NY income (IT-225 code S-103)  _(IT-225 code S-103)_
- **College tuition subtraction** — Up to $10,000 per eligible student (IT-225 code S-106) USD  _(IT-225 code S-106)_
- **NY depreciation subtraction** — Replacement depreciation deduction for assets where bonus depreciation was added back (IT-225 code S-110)  _(IT-225 code S-110)_

### NYC UBT credit mechanism

- **NYC UBT not deductible on Schedule C** — The taxpayer cannot deduct NYC UBT as a business expense on the federal Schedule C (it is a tax, not a deductible business expense).
- **NYC UBT credit generation** — NYC UBT paid generates a partial credit against NYC personal income tax (IT-201 Line 51)  _(IT-201 Line 51)_
- **NYC UBT credit amount** — The credit equals the lesser of: (a) the UBT tax, or (b) the NYC personal income tax before the credit
- **Double-taxation prevention** — Effectively prevents double-taxation of NYC business income at both UBT and personal income tax levels, but the credit is not always dollar-for-dollar

## Section 5 — Refusals

- **R-NY-1** — Upstream skill did not run. Name the specific skill and refuse until it executes.  _(R-NY-1)_
- **R-NY-2** — Multi-state allocation required. If income sourced to states other than NY was not identified at intake and appears in documents, refuse. Multi-state allocation requires IT-203/credit for taxes paid analysis.  _(R-NY-2)_
- **R-NY-3** — NYC UBT allocation dispute. If the taxpayer performed significant business activity outside NYC but is a NYC resident, allocation percentage is complex. Flag for reviewer if allocation is not clearly 100%.  _(R-NY-3)_
- **R-NY-4** — Partnership/S-corp income discovered. K-1 income appearing in documents that was not disclosed at intake. Refuse and recommend CPA.  _(R-NY-4)_
- **R-NY-5** — NY PTET (Pass-Through Entity Tax) election. If the SMLLC elected into NY PTET, different treatment applies. Refuse unless PTET skill is available.  _(R-NY-5)_
