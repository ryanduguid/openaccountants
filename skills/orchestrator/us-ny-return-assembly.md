Handles reconciliation between federal AGI and NY AGI adjustments, NY itemized vs standard deduction election, NYC income tax surcharge, NYC UBT credit against personal income tax, and MCTMT computation. New York full-year residents only.

# US+NY Return Assembly Skill v1.0

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## CRITICAL EXECUTION DIRECTIVE — READ FIRST

**When this skill is invoked, you have already passed through intake. The user has consented to the full workflow. Execute all steps without pausing for permission.**

- Do NOT ask "how deep do you want me to go" or "do you want the full package." Produce it.
- Do NOT announce token counts or tool calls.
- Do NOT ask which deliverables to prioritize. Produce all deliverables listed in Section 6.
- Do NOT re-validate scope that intake already validated.
- Do NOT pause between content skills to check in.
- Self-checks are targets, not blockers. If one fails, flag it for reviewer and continue.
- If you feel the urge to ask "how should I proceed," pick the most defensible path and flag the decision in the reviewer brief.

## Section 3 — Verification matrix

### Federal internal consistency

- Schedule C net profit → Schedule 1 Line 3 → Form 1040 Line 8
- Schedule SE tax → Schedule 2 Line 4 → Form 1040 Line 23
- Half of SE tax → Schedule 1 Line 15 → Form 1040 Line 10
- SE retirement → Schedule 1 Line 16 → Form 1040 Line 10
- SE health insurance → Schedule 1 Line 17 → Form 1040 Line 10
- QBI deduction → Form 1040 Line 13
- Total tax → Form 1040 Line 24
- Form 2210 penalty (if applicable)
- Total payments → Form 1040 Line 33

### New York internal consistency

- Federal AGI → IT-201 Line 19 (starting point)
- NY additions (IT-201 Lines 20-23): interest income on non-NY state/local bonds, QBI deduction add-back (NY does not allow QBI deduction)
- NY subtractions (IT-201 Lines 24-32): interest on US government obligations, NY state/local pension exclusion
- NY AGI → IT-201 Line 33
- NY standard deduction ($8,000 single / $16,050 MFJ) vs NY itemized deduction (IT-201 Line 34-35)
- NY itemized deduction limitations (for high-income taxpayers: 50% limitation on charitable contributions and other adjustments if NY AGI > $525,000)
- NY taxable income → IT-201 Line 38
- NY tax → IT-201 Line 39 (from tax computation worksheet or tax table)
- NYC resident tax → IT-201 Lines 47-51 (if NYC resident)
- NYC UBT credit → IT-201 Line 51 (partial credit against NYC personal income tax)
- NY household credit → IT-201 Line 40 (if income below threshold)
- Total NY tax → IT-201 Line 62
- NY estimated tax payments → IT-201 Line 67
- NY refund or balance due → IT-201 Line 78 or 80

### NYC UBT consistency (if applicable)

- Gross income from NYC business → Form NYC-202 Line 1
- NYC UBT deductions → Form NYC-202 Lines 2-12
- NYC UBT taxable income → Form NYC-202 Line 13
- Exemption calculation ($95,000, phaseout $95K-$150K) → Form NYC-202 Line 14-16
- NYC UBT (4% rate) → Form NYC-202 Line 17
- UBT credits available → NYC-202 Line 18+
- UBT estimated payments → NYC-202 Schedule F
- UBT balance due or refund

### Federal-NY coordination

- Federal AGI used correctly as NY starting point
- QBI deduction properly added back for NY (NY does not conform to §199A)
- Filing status consistent
- Dependents consistent
- NY itemized deductions use federal Schedule A as starting point but apply NY modifications:
  - State/local tax deduction: included for NY purposes (no $10,000 SALT cap at state level)
  - College tuition deduction (IT-201 Line 30): up to $10,000 per student
- Depreciation: NY generally conforms to federal MACRS but has modifications for bonus depreciation (NY decoupled from 100% bonus; add-back required, then NY allows its own depreciation deduction)

### MCTMT verification

- Net self-employment earnings allocated to MCTD
- Threshold: $50,000 (only taxed if net SE earnings in MCTD exceed $50,000)
- Rate: 0.34%
- MCTMT amount → Form MTA-6

### Estimated tax reconciliation

- Federal: 4 quarterly payments cross-checked against safe harbor (100% prior year tax if AGI ≤ $150K, 110% if AGI > $150K)
- NY State: payments on IT-2105 cross-checked against NY safe harbor (100% prior year NY tax or 90% current year)
- NYC UBT: quarterly payments if UBT > $3,400
- Form IT-2105.9 (NY underpayment penalty) if applicable

---

## Section 4 — NY-specific adjustments detail

### Additions to federal AGI (common for freelancers)

1. **QBI deduction add-back**: NY does not allow the §199A deduction. Full federal QBI deduction amount added back on IT-225 Line 1 (code A-201)
2. **Bonus depreciation add-back**: If federal return claimed bonus depreciation, NY requires add-back of the federal bonus amount, then allows NY depreciation (generally MACRS without bonus). IT-225 code A-110.
3. **Other states' municipal bond interest**: Interest from non-NY state/local bonds is added to NY income

### Subtractions from federal AGI (common for freelancers)

1. **US government obligation interest**: Interest on US Treasury securities subtracted from NY income (IT-225 code S-103)
2. **College tuition**: Up to $10,000 per eligible student (IT-225 code S-106)
3. **NY depreciation**: Replacement depreciation deduction for assets where bonus depreciation was added back (IT-225 code S-110)

### NYC UBT credit mechanism

The taxpayer cannot deduct NYC UBT as a business expense on the federal Schedule C (it is a tax, not a deductible business expense). However:
- NYC UBT paid generates a partial credit against NYC personal income tax (IT-201 Line 51)
- The credit equals the lesser of: (a) the UBT tax, or (b) the NYC personal income tax before the credit
- Effectively prevents double-taxation of NYC business income at both UBT and personal income tax levels, but the credit is not always dollar-for-dollar

## Section 5 — Refusals

**R-NY-1 — Upstream skill did not run.** Name the specific skill and refuse until it executes.

**R-NY-2 — Multi-state allocation required.** If income sourced to states other than NY was not identified at intake and appears in documents, refuse. Multi-state allocation requires IT-203/credit for taxes paid analysis.

**R-NY-3 — NYC UBT allocation dispute.** If the taxpayer performed significant business activity outside NYC but is a NYC resident, allocation percentage is complex. Flag for reviewer if allocation is not clearly 100%.

**R-NY-4 — Partnership/S-corp income discovered.** K-1 income appearing in documents that was not disclosed at intake. Refuse and recommend CPA.

**R-NY-5 — NY PTET (Pass-Through Entity Tax) election.** If the SMLLC elected into NY PTET, different treatment applies. Refuse unless PTET skill is available.
