## Section 2 -- Assembly Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Gathering

```
1. Download CFDI emitidos (issued) from SAT portal -- full year XML set
2. Download CFDI recibidos (received) from SAT portal -- full year XML set
3. Obtain bank statements (all accounts, all institutions)
4. Obtain acuses de declaraciones provisionales (ISR + IVA, all months)
5. Obtain constancias de retenciones (employers, clients with retention, platforms)
6. Obtain IMSS payment receipts (if voluntary or employer)
7. Obtain prior year declaración anual (for comparison)
```

### Phase 2: CFDI Revenue Reconciliation

| Step | Check | Action if Mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Sum all CFDI emitidos (subtotal, before IVA) | This = gross revenue for ISR |
| 2.2 | Compare CFDI total vs bank deposits | Bank > CFDI = possible undeclared income |
| 2.3 | Verify método de pago (PUE vs PPD) | PPD: income = when complemento de pago issued |
| 2.4 | Check for cancelled CFDI (status = cancelado) | Exclude cancelled from totals |
| 2.5 | Verify RFC of all clients on CFDI | Flag any RFC genérico (XAXX010101000) > $50,000 |
| 2.6 | Cross-reference CFDI vs client payments | Identify unpaid invoices (for PPD accounting) |

**RESICO Special Rule:** Income is recognised on cash basis (efectivamente cobrado). Only CFDI with confirmed payment count. PPD CFDI without complemento de pago = not yet income.

**AEP Rule:** Income recognised on accrual basis (devengado) for general regime, OR cash basis if elected under Art. 196 CFF. Verify which method the client uses.

### Phase 3: CFDI Expense Reconciliation (AEP Only)

| Step | Check | Action if Mismatch |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Sum all CFDI recibidos (deductible expenses) | Verify each has valid RFC, correct régimen fiscal |
| 3.2 | Verify requisitos de deducibilidad (Art. 27 LISR) | Payment via banked method >$2,000 MXN |
| 3.3 | Check IVA on each CFDI recibido | IVA trasladado = IVA acreditable |
| 3.4 | Verify payment method | Cash payments >$2,000 = NOT deductible |
| 3.5 | Check timing | Expense must be in same fiscal year |
| 3.6 | Verify proportionality | If mixed use, apply proportion |

**Deductibility Requirements (Art. 27 LISR):**
- Strictly indispensable for the business activity
- Backed by valid CFDI
- Paid by transfer, cheque, credit/debit card, or electronic wallet (>$2,000)
- Withholding obligations met (if applicable)
- Properly registered in accounting

### Phase 4: Provisional ISR vs Annual ISR Cross-Check

| Step | Check | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Sum all provisional ISR payments made | Total from acuses |
| 4.2 | Sum all ISR retained by clients (retenciones) | From constancias de retenciones |
| 4.3 | Calculate annual ISR liability | Using Art. 152 table (AEP) or Art. 113-E (RESICO) |
| 4.4 | Annual ISR - provisionals - retentions | = ISR a cargo (to pay) or ISR a favor (refund) |
| 4.5 | If saldo a favor > 30% of ISR annual | Flag -- high refund ratio triggers SAT review |

**RESICO Cross-Check:**
- Annual ISR = total income × applicable RESICO rate
- Credit: sum of monthly provisional payments
- Credit: retenciones (1.25% retained by personas morales)
- Result = a cargo or a favor

**AEP Cross-Check:**
- Annual ISR = progressive table on (revenue - deductions - personal deductions)
- Credit: provisional payments (Art. 106 method)
- Credit: retenciones
- Credit: estímulos fiscales (if applicable)

### Phase 5: IVA Monthly Reconciliation

| Step | Check | Expected Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | IVA trasladado (charged to clients) | 16% × revenue (or 8% border, 0% applicable) |
| 5.2 | IVA acreditable (paid on expenses) | Sum IVA on deductible CFDI recibidos |
| 5.3 | IVA retenido (retained by clients) | From constancias de retenciones (2/3 IVA common) |
| 5.4 | Monthly: trasladado - acreditable - retenido | = IVA a cargo or a favor |
| 5.5 | Cross-check vs monthly declaraciones filed | Verify consistency |
| 5.6 | Annual IVA total | Should = sum of 12 monthly declarations |

**Common IVA Retentions:**
- Persona moral paying persona física: retains 2/3 of IVA (Art. 1-A LIVA)
- Digital platform: retains 100% IVA
- Government entities: retain 100% IVA

### Phase 6: IMSS Cuotas Check

| Item | Check |
|---|---|
| Voluntary (Modalidad 40) | Verify 12 monthly payments made |
| Employer (patrón) | Verify SUA/IDSE bimestral payments (6 periods) |
| Cuotas amount | Verify base declared × contribution rate |
| Deductibility | AEP: deductible as personal deduction (Art. 151-V). RESICO: NOT deductible. |

### Phase 7: Personal Deductions (AEP Annual Return)

| Deduction (Art. 151 LISR) | Limit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Medical/dental/hospital expenses | No global limit per item | Must be for taxpayer, spouse, ascendants, descendants |
| Funeral expenses | 1 UMA anual ($41,273.52) | Per event |
| Donations | Up to 7% of prior year base (4% to gobierno) | Must be to donatarias autorizadas |
| Mortgage interest (real, vivienda) | Up to 750,000 UDIS of credit | Only habitual residence |
| Voluntary retirement savings (Afore/PPR) | 10% of income, max 5 UMA anuales ($206,367.60) | Deductible contribution to Plan Personal de Retiro |
| Health insurance premiums | No specific sub-limit | Complementary medical insurance |
| School transportation | Per child | Only if mandatory |
| Local taxes on property | Actual paid | Predial on property owned |

**Global Personal Deduction Limit:** The lesser of 15% of total income OR 5 UMA anuales (MXN$206,367.60 for 2025).

## Section 6 -- Edge Cases

### Dual Régimen in Same Year (RESICO → AEP Transition)

- If income exceeds $3.5M mid-year, recalculate entire year under AEP
- Credit all RESICO provisional payments against AEP annual liability
- File declaración complementaria for all provisional months
- Update Constancia de Situación Fiscal

### Multiple Income Chapters (Acumulación)

When taxpayer has income from multiple chapters:
- Sueldos y salarios (Cap. I) + AEP (Cap. II): accumulate both in annual
- RESICO + Sueldos: RESICO is separate (no accumulation unless >$300,000 combined)
- Arrendamiento + AEP: both accumulate in annual declaration
- Apply progressive table to total accumulated base

### Pérdidas Fiscales (Tax Losses)

- AEP losses carry forward up to 10 years (Art. 109 LISR)
- Update for inflation annually (factor de actualización)
- Cannot offset losses against RESICO income
- RESICO does NOT generate tax losses (no deductions allowed)

### Estímulos Fiscales (Tax Incentives)

| Incentive | Article | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| Technological research/development | Art. 202 LISR | 30% credit on R&D spending |
| Film/theatre production | Art. 189-190 LISR | Credit against ISR |
| Northern border region | Decree 2019 | ISR rate reduced to 20%; IVA 8% |
| Donations to trusts | Art. 151 LISR | 7% limit |

---

## Section 7 -- Red Flags and Audit Triggers

| Indicator | SAT Risk Level | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Bank deposits > CFDI revenue by >20% | HIGH | Investigate -- potential discrepancia fiscal |
| ISR refund > 40% of annual liability | MEDIUM | Document thoroughly; expect SAT query |
| Zero CFDI for months with bank activity | HIGH | File complementarias or explain |
| CFDI to RFC genérico > $50,000 individual | MEDIUM | SAT flags for review |
| Provisional payments all in ceros despite income | HIGH | Immediate regularisation needed |
| Deductions > 60% of revenue | MEDIUM | Verify each deduction meets Art. 27 |
| Personal deductions near global limit | LOW | Normal -- just document properly |
| Year-over-year revenue drop > 50% | MEDIUM | SAT may compare to CFDI history |

---
