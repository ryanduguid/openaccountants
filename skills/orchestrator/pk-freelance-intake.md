description: ALWAYS USE THIS SKILL when a user asks for help with their Pakistan taxes AND mentions freelancing, self-employment, sole proprietorship, IT exports, or being a business individual in Pakistan. Trigger on phrases like "help me with my Pakistan taxes", "I'm a freelancer in Pakistan", "I export IT services", "file my FBR return", "I'm self-employed in Pakistan". This is the REQUIRED entry point for the Pakistan self-employed workflow — downstream skills (pk-it-export-tax, pk-income-tax, pk-social-contributions, pakistan-sales-tax, pk-return-assembly) depend on it. Upload-first; Pakistan-resident individuals only.

# Pakistan Self-Employed Intake — Orchestrator v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## What this file is
The intake orchestrator for Pakistan-resident self-employed individuals (freelancers, IT exporters, sole proprietors). It collects facts, parses documents, confirms, and hands off a structured package. It computes nothing.

## Step 1 — Refusal sweep (route correctly)
1. **Do you earn mainly from foreign clients (IT/services export) or domestic clients?** → routes to pk-it-export-tax vs pk-income-tax.
2. **Registered with PSEB?** → determines the IT-export rate (~0.25% vs ~1%).
3. **Do you have an NTN / are you on the Active Taxpayer List (ATL)?** → filer status.
4. **Do you provide taxable services within a province?** → provincial sales tax on services (Sindh/Punjab/KPK/Balochistan/ICT).
5. **Pakistan tax resident this year (183-day test)?** → non-residents escalate.

Defaults if unanswered: resident business individual, not PSEB-registered, encourage NTN + ATL.

## Step 2 — Collect
- Bank statements (incl. foreign remittances / PRCs) for the full tax year (1 Jul–30 Jun).
- Platform statements (Upwork, Fiverr, direct invoices).
- NTN / IRIS credentials; prior return + wealth statement.
- PSEB registration certificate if any.

## Step 3 — Infer & confirm
- Separate **export income** (banking-channel remittances → pk-it-export-tax) from **domestic income** (→ pk-income-tax).
- Identify provincial services-sales-tax exposure.
- Confirm filer/ATL status (affects withholding).

## Step 4 — Hand off
- **Export IT freelancer:** pk-it-export-tax (final tax) + (sales tax on services if domestic) → pk-return-assembly.
- **Domestic business:** pk-income-tax + provincial sales tax + pk-social-contributions → pk-return-assembly.

## Disclaimer
Intake only; computes no tax. All downstream outputs must be reviewed and signed off by a qualified Pakistani tax practitioner before filing. Maintained at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
