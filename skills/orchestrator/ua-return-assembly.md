name: ua-return-assembly
description: >
  Use this skill as the final orchestrator that assembles the complete Ukrainian
  ФОП (FOP) filing package for a Ukraine-resident sole proprietor. It consumes the
  outputs of the Ukraine content skills (ua-single-tax, ua-income-tax,
  ua-social-contributions, ukraine-vat) and produces one unified reviewer package:
  the correct declaration, all schedules, the filing-and-payment calendar, and a
  pre-filing checklist. It computes nothing itself. Trigger on phrases like "file my
  Ukrainian return", "assemble my FOP declaration", "submit single-tax return
  Ukraine", or "put together my ФОП filing package".

# Ukraine FOP Return-Assembly Orchestrator v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

## 1. What this file is

This is the capstone skill for the Ukraine self-employed (ФОП / FOP) workflow. It runs **last**, after intake and after the content skills have produced their numbers.

It **computes nothing**. Its job is to:

- pick the correct declaration based on the regime,
- gather every content-skill output into one reviewer package,
- lay out the filing-and-payment calendar by group,
- describe submission via the Електронний кабінет with a КЕП, and
- run the final pre-filing checklist.

All tax figures come from the content skills. This orchestrator only sequences, reconciles, and packages. Every number is provisional until a qualified Ukrainian accountant reviews and signs off.

Do not re-interrogate scope that `ua-freelance-intake` already validated (ФОП vs ТОВ, simplified vs general, group, VAT status, residency). Trust the intake package; cross-check specific numbers during reconciliation only.

---

## 2. Inputs required

**The structured intake package** from `ua-freelance-intake`:
- ФОП status confirmed; regime (simplified single tax vs general system); group (1, 2, or 3) if simplified; VAT registration status; confirmed Ukrainian tax residency for the year.
- КВЕД activity codes; bank-statement-derived income (FX converted to UAH at the NBU rate on the date of receipt); flags for barred activities or approach to the group income cap.

**Per-skill outputs** (whichever apply to the regime):
- `ua-single-tax` — single-tax liability and the 1% military levy where applicable; group, period, and rate (Group 1/2 fixed; Group 3 percentage 3% VAT-registered / 5% non-VAT).
- `ua-income-tax` — general-system net taxable income, 18% PIT and 5% military levy (general-system FOPs only).
- `ua-social-contributions` — ЄСВ (unified social contribution) "for self," by quarter, at 22% of the contribution base with the monthly minimum, plus any exemption (pensioner, disability, employed elsewhere as primary job, mobilised).
- `ukraine-vat` — VAT return box values and net VAT payable/refundable (registered FOPs only).

If a required output is missing, halt and route back to the relevant content skill before assembling.

## 3. Decision tree — which declaration, which schedules

```
Is the FOP on the SIMPLIFIED system (single tax)?
│
├── YES → Декларація платника єдиного податку
│         (single-tax payer declaration, MoF Order No. 578)
│         │
│         ├── Group 1 or 2 → ANNUAL declaration
│         │     + Додаток 1 (ЄСВ "for self") where ЄСВ was paid
│         │     + monthly single tax & military levy paid by the 20th
│         │
│         └── Group 3 → QUARTERLY declaration (cumulative within the year)
│               + Додаток 1 (ЄСВ "for self")
│               + ukraine-vat return separately if VAT-registered (3% rate)
│
└── NO (GENERAL system) → Декларація про майновий стан і доходи
          (property-status-and-income declaration) — ANNUAL
          + the FOP business-income section (18% PIT + 5% military levy)
          + ЄСВ "for self" reported via the quarterly combined report (see §4)
          + ukraine-vat return separately if VAT-registered
```

Notes:
- The single-tax declaration and the property-and-income declaration are **mutually exclusive** for the period — a FOP is on exactly one regime.
- ЄСВ "for self" is now reconciled through the **quarterly combined report** (об'єднана звітність з ЄСВ, ПДФО та військовим збором). For simplified FOPs, ЄСВ "for self" continues to be declared via Додаток 1 to the single-tax declaration; the combined report covers ЄСВ/PIT/military-levy where the FOP has **employees** or pays individuals.
- VAT is always its own return on its own monthly cycle; it is never folded into the income or single-tax declaration.

## 4. Filing & payment calendar (tax year 2026)

Standard rule: if a deadline falls on a weekend or public holiday, it moves to the next working day. Dates below already reflect 2026 weekend shifts where confirmed.

| Obligation | Group 1 & 2 (simplified) | Group 3 (simplified) | General system |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Single-tax / income declaration — filing** | Annual: by **2 Mar 2026** (for 2025; 1 Mar is Sunday) | Quarterly, within 40 days of quarter-end: Q1 by **11 May 2026**, Q2 by **10 Aug 2026**, Q3 by **9 Nov 2026**, Q4/annual by **9 Feb 2027** | Annual property-and-income declaration: by **1 May 2026** (for 2025) |
| **Single tax — payment** | **Monthly**, by the **20th** of each month (advance payment) | **Quarterly**, within 10 days of the filing deadline: Q1 by ~20 May, Q2 by ~20 Aug, Q3 by ~19 Nov, Q4 by ~19 Feb 2027 | n/a (pays PIT instead) |
| **PIT (18%)** | n/a | n/a | Final settlement by **10 May 2026** (10 days after filing); advance instalments during the year |
| **Military levy** | Built into the single-tax regime; paid monthly with single tax (by the 20th) | 1% of income, paid quarterly within 10 days of the filing deadline | 5% of net income, settled with PIT by **10 May 2026** |
| **ЄСВ (unified social contribution, "for self")** | **Quarterly**, by the 20th of the month after the quarter: Q1 by **20 Apr 2026**, Q2 by **20 Jul 2026**, Q3 by **19 Oct 2026**, Q4 by **19 Jan 2027** | Same quarterly schedule as Group 1&2 | Same quarterly schedule |
| **VAT return (if registered)** | Monthly: within **20 days** after the reporting month | Same — monthly within 20 days | Same — monthly within 20 days |
| **VAT payment (if registered)** | Within **10 days** after the return filing deadline (~30th of the following month) | Same | Same |

**2026 reporting change — abolition of the separate monthly report:** From 1 January 2026 the separate **monthly** ЄСВ / PIT / military-levy calculation (Податковий розрахунок) is abolished for FOPs and self-employed persons. It is replaced by a **quarterly combined report** (об'єднана звітність), first due for Q1 2026 within 40 calendar days of quarter-end (i.e. by ~10–11 May 2026). The report is one quarterly form that still breaks the figures out month-by-month inside it. The monthly cycle remains only for legal entities. Confirm the FOP files the combined report only where it has employees / pays individuals; a FOP with no employees declares ЄСВ "for self" through the declaration's Додаток 1.

> The exact ЄСВ minimum, single-tax fixed amounts, and military-levy figures for 2026 come from the content skills, not this orchestrator. Do not hard-code them here.

## 5. Submission — Електронний кабінет + КЕП

All FOP declarations and reports are filed **electronically** through the State Tax Service's **Електронний кабінет** (cabinet.tax.gov.ua) — or an accredited e-reporting provider (Вчасно, M.E.Doc, Соната, Taxer, etc.).

Process:
1. **Authenticate** to the Електронний кабінет with a **КЕП** (кваліфікований електронний підпис — qualified electronic signature). The КЕП identifies the FOP and is mandatory for signing.
2. Open **«Ведення звітності»** (reporting), select the correct form for the period:
   - Декларація платника єдиного податку (single-tax payer declaration) — simplified FOPs; or
   - Декларація про майновий стан і доходи (property-and-income declaration) — general-system FOPs; plus
   - the **об'єднана звітність** (quarterly combined report) if there are employees; and
   - the VAT return (Податкова декларація з ПДВ) if registered.
3. Attach the relevant додатки (e.g. **Додаток 1** for ЄСВ "for self").
4. **Sign with the КЕП** and submit.
5. Wait for **two receipts (квитанції)**:
   - **Квитанція №1** — confirms delivery to the tax authority's receiving system.
   - **Квитанція №2** — the acceptance receipt. The report is **officially filed only when Квитанція №2 reads «Прийнято» (Accepted).**
6. Pay the liabilities by the payment deadlines in §4 (filing and payment are separate dates).

Store both квитанції with the package as proof of filing. A missing or rejected Квитанція №2 means the report is **not** filed — resolve the rejection reason and resubmit before the deadline.

This skill performs **orchestration only**: it selects the correct declaration, sequences the content skills, builds the calendar, and packages the result. It computes no tax. Every figure, schedule, and return assembled here is **provisional** and must be reviewed and signed off by a **qualified Ukrainian accountant or auditor** before it is filed with the State Tax Service. Deadlines and form references reflect rules as understood for tax year 2026 and must be re-verified against tax.gov.ua / dps.gov.ua at filing time.
