## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### State income tax rate

| Tax year | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2025 | 3.05% | IC 6-3-2-1 (phased reduction schedule) |
| 2026 | 2.95% | IC 6-3-2-1; DOR Departmental Notice #1 (Jan. 1, 2026) |
| 2027 (planned) | 2.90% | IC 6-3-2-1 |

Indiana imposes a **flat** state adjusted gross income tax. There are no graduated brackets.

### County income taxes

All 92 Indiana counties levy a local income tax (LIT) on top of the state rate. County rates are determined by the county of residence as of January 1 of the tax year.

| Example county | County rate (2026) | Combined rate |
|---|---|---|
| Marion (Indianapolis) | 2.02% | 4.97% |
| Hamilton (Carmel/Fishers) | 1.10% | 4.05% |
| Allen (Fort Wayne) | 1.48% | 4.43% |
| Lake (Gary/Hammond) | 1.50% | 4.45% |
| Switzerland (highest) | 3.38% | 6.33% |

Full county rate table: See DOR Departmental Notice #1 at <https://www.in.gov/dor/files/dn01.pdf>.

### Deductions and exemptions

| Item | Amount (2026) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Standard deduction | None — Indiana does not have a state standard deduction | IC 6-3 |
| Personal exemption | $1,000 per taxpayer, spouse | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(3) |
| Dependent exemption | $1,500 per qualifying dependent | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(4) |
| Additional exemption (age 65+) | $1,000 per qualifying individual | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(5) |
| Additional exemption (blind) | $1,000 per qualifying individual | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(6) |

**Note:** Indiana also offers various add-back and deduction modifications (see Section 3) and tax credits that reduce the final liability.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

Indiana starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11.

### Add-backs (additions to income)

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Bonus depreciation | Indiana does not conform to IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation; add back the federal amount and claim standard MACRS instead | IC 6-3-1-3.5(b) |
| State/local tax refunds | If deducted federally in a prior year and included in federal AGI as income, adjustments may be needed | IC 6-3 |
| Other state/municipal bond interest | Interest from bonds of states other than Indiana must be added back | IC 6-3-1-3.5(b) |
| Section 179 excess | Indiana caps §179 at a lower threshold than federal — excess must be added back | IC 6-3-2-1.5 |

### Subtractions (deductions from income)

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. government interest | Interest on U.S. obligations (Treasuries, savings bonds) | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(2) |
| Social Security benefits | Indiana fully exempts Social Security benefits | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a) |
| Indiana NOL deduction | Net operating loss carryforward per Indiana rules | IC 6-3 |
| Military pay | Active-duty military pay for Indiana residents | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a) |
| Renter's deduction | Up to $3,000 for qualifying renters | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a)(7) |
| Indiana 529 contributions | Up to $7,500 per taxpayer for contributions to Indiana CollegeChoice 529 plans | IC 6-3-1-3.5(a) |

### Resulting computation

Federal AGI + add-backs − subtractions = Indiana adjusted gross income → minus exemptions → times 2.95% = state tax.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe $1,000 or more for the year in combined state and county income tax.

| Voucher | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Use Form ES-40 for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance
Indiana follows federal treatment — the self-employed health insurance deduction reduces federal AGI and flows through automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))
Indiana follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce federal AGI and flow through to Indiana.

### Home office deduction
Indiana follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C, which is included in federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)
Indiana does **not** allow the federal qualified business income deduction because Indiana starts from federal AGI (before QBI deduction). The QBI deduction does not affect Indiana taxable income.
