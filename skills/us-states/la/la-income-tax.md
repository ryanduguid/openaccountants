## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### State income tax rate

| Tax year | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2024 and prior | Graduated: 1.85% / 3.50% / 4.25% | La. R.S. 47:32 (prior law) |
| 2025 and after | **Flat 3.00%** | Act 11 (H.B. 10, 2024 3rd Extraordinary Session) |

Effective January 1, 2025, Louisiana replaced its three-bracket graduated system with a **flat 3% rate** on all taxable income, for all filing statuses.

### Standard deduction (2025 tax year)

| Filing status | Amount |
|---|---|
| Single | $12,500 |
| Married Filing Separately | $12,500 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $25,000 |
| Head of Household | $25,000 |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $25,000 |

**Note:** These amounts were significantly increased by Act 11 (previously $4,500 / $9,000). Beginning January 1, 2026, the standard deduction is adjusted annually for CPI inflation.

### Personal exemptions

Act 11 **repealed** the prior personal exemptions ($1,000 for age 65+, blind, and dependents). These are no longer available for TY2025+.

### Retirement income exemption

Up to $12,000 of annual retirement income is exempt for taxpayers age 65+. This amount is adjusted annually for CPI beginning in 2026.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

Louisiana starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11.

### Additions to income

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Out-of-state bond interest | Interest on bonds of other states must be added | La. R.S. 47:293(4) |
| Federal income tax deducted | Louisiana historically allowed a deduction for federal taxes; under the reformed law, verify if this continues to apply | La. R.S. 47:293 |
| IRC decoupling items | Any areas where Louisiana decouples from federal tax code changes | La. R.S. 47 |

### Subtractions from income

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| U.S. government interest | Interest on U.S. obligations | La. R.S. 47:293(6) |
| Social Security benefits | Louisiana exempts Social Security | La. R.S. 47:44.2 |
| Federal income taxes paid | Louisiana allows a deduction for federal income taxes paid (may be limited under new law — verify) | La. R.S. 47:293(3) |
| Retirement income | Up to $12,000 for taxpayers age 65+ | La. R.S. 47:44.1 |
| Military pay | Active-duty military compensation exclusion | La. R.S. 47:293 |

### Resulting computation

Federal AGI + additions − subtractions − standard deduction = Louisiana taxable income → times 3% = Louisiana income tax.

**Important:** Louisiana has historically allowed a deduction for federal income taxes paid, which is unusual among states. Under the 2025 reform, confirm the current treatment of this deduction.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe $1,000 or more.

| Voucher | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Use Form IT-540ES for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance
Louisiana follows federal treatment — the deduction reduces federal AGI and flows through.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))
Louisiana follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce federal AGI and flow through.

### Home office deduction
Louisiana follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C, included in federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)
Louisiana does **not** allow the federal QBI deduction because Louisiana starts from federal AGI (before the QBI deduction). The QBI deduction does not affect Louisiana taxable income.

### Filing deadline
Louisiana's individual income tax return deadline is **May 15** (not April 15). This is one month later than most states.
