## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rates (TY 2025)

**Regular Tax Table — All filing statuses (net taxable income ≤ $92,300)**

| Net taxable income | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0 – $5,499 | 0% |
| $5,500 – $10,899 | 2.0% |
| $10,900 – $15,599 | 3.0% |
| $15,600 – $25,699 | 3.4% |
| $25,700 – $92,300 | 3.9% |

**High-income table (net taxable income > $92,300)**

| Net taxable income | Rate |
| --- | --- |
| $0 – $4,600 | 2.0% |
| $4,601 and above | 3.9% |

- **Top marginal rate TY 2025** — 3.9% (reduced from 4.4% by Act 1 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2024)  _(Act 1 of the Second Extraordinary Session of 2024)_

### Standard deduction (TY 2025)

**Standard deduction by filing status**

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
| --- | --- |
| Single (Status 1) | $2,410 |
| Married Filing Jointly (Status 2) | $4,820 |
| Married Filing Separately (Status 4/5) | $2,410 |
| Head of Household (Status 3) | $2,410 |
| Qualifying Surviving Spouse (Status 6) | $2,410 |

### Personal tax credit

**Personal tax credit amount**

| Credit | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| Per exemption (taxpayer, spouse, dependents) | $29 |

- **Texarkana exemption** — Residents of Texarkana, Arkansas are fully exempt from Arkansas individual income taxes.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

- **Starting point** — Arkansas begins with federal adjusted gross income (from federal Form 1040, Line 11).
- **Arkansas adjustments (Form AR1000ADJ)** — Add back or subtract items per Arkansas law.
- **Arkansas additions** — Income not included federally but taxable in AR (e.g., certain exempt interest from other states).
- **Arkansas subtractions** — Income included federally but exempt in AR (e.g., first $6,000 of retirement income for taxpayers 59½+, active-duty military income, U.S. obligation interest).
- **Deductions** — Subtract standard deduction or Arkansas itemized deductions.
- **Result** — Net taxable income → apply graduated rates from tax table.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity

- **IRC conformity** — Arkansas generally conforms to the IRC for computing income, including Schedule C business deductions.
- **Above-the-line deductions** — Arkansas adopts most above-the-line deductions that reduce federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (§199A)

- **QBI treatment in Arkansas** — The federal QBI deduction is taken below the line on the federal return and does not affect federal AGI. Therefore, it does not flow into Arkansas's starting point. Arkansas does not have its own QBI equivalent deduction.

### SE health insurance deduction

- **SE health insurance treatment** — Flows through federal AGI (above-the-line deduction on federal Form 1040) and is automatically reflected in Arkansas's starting point.

### Retirement contributions

- **SEP-IRA / Solo 401(k)** — SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI and therefore reduce Arkansas starting income.
- **Retirement income subtraction** — $6,000 USD (for taxpayers age 59½+)

### Home office deduction

- **Home office treatment** — Federal home office deduction flows through Schedule C and is reflected in federal AGI.

### Estimated tax payments

- **Threshold** — Must pay estimated tax if you expect to owe tax after withholding and credits (Arkansas follows federal estimated tax principles).
- **Due dates** — April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
- **Payment methods** — Via ATAP (Arkansas Taxpayer Access Point) online portal or by mail with Form AR1000ES.
- **Safe harbor** — Pay 90% of current year liability or 100% of prior year liability.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

- **Texarkana exemption** — T1-06  _(Full exemption for Texarkana, AR residents)_
- **High-income table threshold** — T1-07  _(Use alternate table if net taxable income > $92,300)_

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

- **Standard deduction vs. itemized** — T2-01  _(Taxpayer must compare; both spouses must use same method)_
- **Regular vs. low-income tax table** — T2-02  _(Low-income table incorporates standard deduction — cannot also claim separately)_
- **Part-year resident allocation** — T2-03  _(Requires Form AR1000NR and income sourcing analysis)_
- **Credit for taxes paid to other states** — T2-04  _(Requires documentation of income taxed elsewhere)_
- **Business vs. hobby determination** — T2-05  _(Same federal analysis, but affects AR Schedule C flow-through)_
