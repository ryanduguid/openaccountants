## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax year 2025 rate

| Rate | Applies to |
|---|---|
| 5.3% (flat) | Idaho taxable income above the exempt amount |

**Exempt amount (not taxed):**
| Filing status | Exempt amount |
|---|---|
| Single / Married filing separately | $4,811 |
| Married filing jointly / Head of household / Qualifying surviving spouse | $9,622 |

**Computation:** (Idaho taxable income − exempt amount) × 5.3% = Idaho tax. If result is ≤ 0, tax is zero.

Source: Idaho Code § 63-3024; Form 40 (2025) tax computation worksheet.

### Standard deduction (tax year 2025)

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
|---|---|
| Single / Married filing separately | $15,750 |
| Married filing jointly / Qualifying surviving spouse | $31,500 |
| Head of household | $23,625 |

Source: Form 40 (2025); Idaho conforms to federal standard deduction amounts.

### Filing thresholds (tax year 2025)

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** Idaho starts from federal taxable income (Form 1040, Line 15), NOT federal AGI. This is a key distinction from many other states.

### Key additions to Idaho income
- State/local tax refunds (if itemized federally and deducted state taxes)
- Idaho-specific additions (rare for most sole proprietors)

### Key subtractions from Idaho income
- Interest on U.S. government obligations (Treasury bonds, savings bonds)
- State income tax refund already included in federal income
- Idaho capital gains deduction (60% of qualifying Idaho-source capital gains held 12+ months, up to a net of $15,000 in deductions — see Form CG)
- Social Security benefits taxed by Idaho only to the extent included in federal taxable income (Idaho conforms to federal treatment)

### Net result
Federal taxable income ± Idaho additions/subtractions = Idaho taxable income → subtract exempt amount → × 5.3% = Idaho income tax.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
Idaho starts from federal taxable income, which is AFTER the QBI deduction (Form 1040, Line 13 → Line 15). Therefore, the federal QBI deduction reduces Idaho taxable income automatically. No separate Idaho adjustment needed.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI → federal taxable income. Flows through automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI → federal taxable income. No add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI → federal taxable income. Flows through automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form 51)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $1,000 or more.

Voucher due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.

Safe harbor: No penalty if payments equal at least 100% of prior year tax OR 90% of current year tax.

### Idaho Grocery Tax Credit (Food Tax Credit)
All Idaho residents receive a grocery tax credit (refundable):
- $120 per person (under 65)
- $140 per person (65+)
This credit is available regardless of income and offsets the 6% sales tax on groceries.

### Permanent Building Fund
Idaho charges a $10 contribution to the Permanent Building Fund on every return (included in the tax computation, Line 31 of Form 40).
