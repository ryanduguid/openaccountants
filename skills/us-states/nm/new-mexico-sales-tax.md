CRITICAL: NM GRT taxes virtually ALL services and most transactions. One of the broadest tax bases in the US (similar to Hawaii GET). Tax is on the seller, not the buyer.

- **Prohibition: services exemption assumption** — NEVER assume services are exempt -- NM taxes virtually ALL services.
- **Prohibition: deduction vs exemption confusion** — NEVER confuse "deduction" with "exemption" -- NM uses deductions from gross receipts.
- **Prohibition: computing numbers** — NEVER compute any number.
