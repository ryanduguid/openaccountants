## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

New Mexico taxable income starts with **federal adjusted gross income (FAGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Start with federal AGI** → PIT-1
2. **Add NM additions** — items NM adds back
3. **Subtract NM subtractions** — items NM excludes
4. **Subtract NM exemptions** (low-and-middle-income exemption, blind/aged exemptions)
5. **Subtract standard or itemized deductions** (NM follows federal amounts)
6. **Result = NM taxable income**
7. **Apply the graduated rate schedule** → NM tax
8. **Apply credits and rebates** (Schedule PIT-CR) → final tax due or refund

### Key addition modifications

| Addition | Description |
|---|---|
| Lump-sum distributions | Certain lump-sum distributions not included in federal AGI |
| NM income not in federal AGI | Income taxable by NM but excluded from federal return |

### Key subtraction modifications

| Subtraction | Description |
|---|---|
| US government bond interest | Interest from US Treasury obligations |
| Social Security | NM does not tax Social Security benefits |
| Military retirement pay | Exempt for certain qualifying individuals |
| Age 65+ income exemption | Up to $8,000 for 65+ with AGI under $51,000 (single) or $36,667 (MFJ per spouse) |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income flow

Schedule C net profit flows into federal AGI, which is the starting point for NM. NM follows the federal self-employment tax deduction (deductible half of SE tax) through federal AGI.

### Estimated tax

NM requires estimated tax payments if you expect to owe **$1,000 or more** after subtracting withholding and credits.

| Installment | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form PIT-ES is used for estimated tax payments.

### Gross Receipts Tax (GRT) interaction

Self-employed taxpayers in NM are also subject to the **Gross Receipts Tax (GRT)**, which is NM's equivalent of a sales/use tax but is imposed on the seller's gross receipts. Unlike a traditional sales tax, the GRT is imposed on the business (not the buyer), though it is commonly passed through to customers.

- GRT applies to **most services** as well as goods (unlike most state sales taxes).
- Rates vary by location (combined state + local: approximately 5.0% to 9.4375%).
- Self-employed service providers must register for and collect/remit GRT.
- GRT paid is deductible as a business expense on the federal Schedule C.

### Working Families Tax Credit (NM EIC)

NM offers a refundable earned income credit equal to **25% of the federal Earned Income Credit (EIC)** for TY 2025. This is particularly valuable for lower-income self-employed taxpayers.

| NM-T2-02 | **GRT vs. income tax interaction** | GRT is a separate tax on gross receipts, not a credit against income tax. GRT paid is deductible as a business expense on federal Schedule C, which flows through to NM. |
| NM-T2-03 | **Technology jobs tax credit** | NM offers credits for qualifying technology businesses. Requires certification. |
| NM-T2-04 | **Angel investment credit** | NM allows credits for qualified investments in NM small businesses. Requires approval from NM Economic Development Department. |
| NM-T2-05 | **Federal IRC conformity** | NM's conformity with the IRC should be verified for recent federal changes. NM generally has rolling conformity but may decouple from specific provisions. |
| NM-T2-06 | **Community property** | New Mexico IS a community property state. MFS returns require community property income allocation. |
