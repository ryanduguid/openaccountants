**CRITICAL: NM GRT taxes virtually ALL services and most transactions. One of the broadest tax bases in the US (similar to Hawaii GET). Tax is on the seller, not the buyer.**

## Section 10 -- Prohibitions

- **Prohibition -- terminology** — NEVER call NM's tax a "sales tax" without noting it is a GRT on the seller.
- **Prohibition -- services exemption assumption** — NEVER assume services are exempt -- NM taxes virtually ALL services.
- **Prohibition -- deduction vs exemption** — NEVER confuse "deduction" with "exemption" -- NM uses deductions from gross receipts.
- **Prohibition -- computation** — NEVER compute any number.
