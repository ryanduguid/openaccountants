## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** Hawaii begins with federal adjusted gross income (AGI) from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

### Key additions to Hawaii income
- Interest on state/local obligations of other states
- Amounts deducted federally but not allowed by Hawaii

### Key subtractions from Hawaii income
- Social Security benefits (Hawaii does not tax Social Security)
- Interest on U.S. government obligations (Treasury bonds, savings bonds)
- Military reserve/National Guard pay (limited exclusion)
- Certain pension income adjustments

### Net result
Federal AGI ± Hawaii modifications = Hawaii AGI → minus standard or itemized deductions → minus personal exemptions = Hawaii taxable income → apply rate schedule.

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
Hawaii starts from federal AGI. The federal QBI deduction (§199A) is below AGI and does NOT flow into Hawaii's computation.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI. Flows through to Hawaii automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI. No Hawaii add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI. Flows through automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form N-1)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $500 or more.

Voucher due dates: April 20, June 20, September 20, January 20.

**Note:** Hawaii's due dates are the 20th (not the 15th like most states).

### General Excise Tax (GET) interaction
Hawaii self-employed individuals are also subject to GET on gross business income (4% general rate, 4.5% in Honolulu County with the county surcharge). GET is NOT the same as income tax. GET paid is a deductible business expense on federal Schedule C, reducing federal AGI and therefore Hawaii taxable income. See `hi-sales-tax.md` for GET details.

### Hawaii conformity notes
Hawaii generally conforms to the Internal Revenue Code as of a specific date. However, Hawaii has its own depreciation rules and may not conform to all federal provisions. Key differences:
- Hawaii does NOT conform to federal bonus depreciation (§168(k))
- Taxpayers must use Hawaii's depreciation schedule (generally straight-line MACRS equivalent)

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| HI-IT-1.01 | Hawaii taxable income = Hawaii AGI − deduction − personal exemptions |
| HI-IT-1.02 | If taxable income < $100,000, use tax table; if ≥ $100,000, use rate schedule |
| HI-IT-1.03 | Personal exemption: $1,144 per taxpayer, spouse (if joint), and each dependent |
| HI-IT-1.04 | Social Security benefits are fully excluded from Hawaii income |
| HI-IT-1.05 | Filing deadline is April 20 (not April 15) |
| HI-IT-1.06 | Automatic 6-month extension to October 20 if estimated tax paid timely |
| HI-IT-1.07 | Hawaii does not conform to federal §168(k) bonus depreciation |
| HI-IT-1.08 | Hawaii allows credit for taxes paid to other states |

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| HI-IT-2.01 | Standard vs. itemized deduction election | Hawaii allows itemization independently of federal choice |
| HI-IT-2.02 | Depreciation conformity analysis | Determine add-back for federal bonus depreciation vs. Hawaii depreciation |
| HI-IT-2.03 | Part-year resident allocation | Prorate income for period of Hawaii residency |
| HI-IT-2.04 | GET vs. income tax interaction | Ensure GET is properly deducted on Schedule C, not double-counted |
| HI-IT-2.05 | Food/excise tax credit | Available to lower-income residents; verify eligibility |
| HI-IT-2.06 | Refundable food/excise tax credit | $110 per exemption if federal AGI ≤ $50,000 (single) |
