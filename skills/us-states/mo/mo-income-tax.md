## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rates — TY 2025 / 2026 (all filing statuses)

Missouri uses the **same brackets for all filing statuses**. The standard deduction varies by filing status, which determines how much income is subject to tax.

| Missouri taxable income | Tax |
|---|---|
| $0 – $1,313 | $0 (0%) |
| Over $1,313 – $2,626 | 2.0% of excess over $1,313 |
| Over $2,626 – $3,939 | $26 + 2.5% of excess over $2,626 |
| Over $3,939 – $5,252 | $59 + 3.0% of excess over $3,939 |
| Over $5,252 – $6,565 | $98 + 3.5% of excess over $5,252 |
| Over $6,565 – $7,878 | $144 + 4.0% of excess over $6,565 |
| Over $7,878 – $9,191 | $197 + 4.5% of excess over $7,878 |
| Over $9,191 | $256 + 4.7% of excess over $9,191 |

### Standard deduction — TY 2025

| Filing status | Amount |
|---|---|
| Single | $15,750 |
| MFJ / Qualifying Surviving Spouse | $31,500 |
| MFS | $15,750 |
| Head of Household | $23,625 |

Missouri does NOT have a separate personal exemption. The standard deduction is the primary below-the-line deduction.

### Key thresholds

| Item | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Filing deadline | April 15, 2026 (for TY 2025) | RSMo § 143.511 |
| Extension | Automatic 6-month with federal extension | RSMo § 143.511 |
| Estimated tax threshold | $100 expected liability | RSMo § 143.521 |
| Capital gains subtraction | 100% of net capital gains (effective TY 2025) | RSMo § 143.022 |

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Missouri adjusted gross income begins with **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11, then applies Missouri-specific modifications.

1. **Additions (Form MO-A)** — Add back items Missouri does not exclude (e.g., interest on non-Missouri state/municipal bonds).
2. **Subtractions (Form MO-A)** — Subtract items Missouri excludes:
   - 100% of net capital gains (effective TY 2025)
   - Social Security benefits included in federal AGI
   - Federal income tax deduction (Missouri is one of few states that allows a deduction for federal income tax paid, capped at $5,000 single / $10,000 MFJ)
   - U.S. government bond interest
3. **Missouri AGI** — Federal AGI + additions − subtractions.
4. **Standard or itemized deduction** — Missouri conforms to federal amounts (with some modifications).
5. **Missouri taxable income** — Missouri AGI − deductions.
6. **Tax** — Apply the eight graduated brackets.
7. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** flows through federal Schedule C → federal AGI → Missouri AGI. No separate Missouri schedule for self-employment income.
2. **Federal SE tax deduction** — Reflected in federal AGI; carries through to Missouri automatically.
3. **Federal income tax deduction** — Missouri allows a deduction for federal income tax paid (including SE tax), capped at $5,000 (single/HoH/MFS) or $10,000 (MFJ). This is a significant benefit.
4. **Capital gains subtraction** — 100% of net capital gains reported on the federal return may be subtracted from Missouri AGI (effective TY 2025). If a sole proprietor sells business assets, the gain may qualify.
5. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments (Form MO-1040ES) if expected liability exceeds $100. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
6. **Health insurance deduction** — Self-employed health insurance deduction is in federal AGI. No Missouri add-back.
7. **City earnings tax** — If located in Kansas City or St. Louis, self-employment earnings are subject to the 1% city earnings tax (separate filing required).

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| MO-T2-01 | **Residency determination** — Missouri uses a domicile test. A person domiciled in Missouri is a full-year resident. | If taxpayer has homes in multiple states, flag for professional review. |
| MO-T2-02 | **Federal tax deduction** — The deduction is for federal tax actually paid (not accrued). Compute using taxes paid during the calendar year, including estimated payments and withholding. | This interacts with federal refunds/balances due in a circular manner. Use prior-year federal tax paid as a proxy. |
| MO-T2-03 | **Capital gains subtraction** — Applies to net long-term capital gains. Determine which gains qualify (e.g., business asset sales, stock sales). | Ensure net capital gains are correctly computed before applying 100% subtraction. |
| MO-T2-04 | **Credit for taxes paid to other states (Form MO-CR)** — Non-refundable credit to prevent double taxation. | Requires the other state's return. |
| MO-T2-05 | **Kansas City / St. Louis earnings tax** — Self-employed persons with business activity in these cities must file separately. | Flag if taxpayer operates in KC or STL. |
| MO-T2-06 | **Standard vs. itemized deduction** — Missouri allows either; if itemizing, Missouri generally conforms to federal Schedule A with modifications. | Compare both methods; Missouri itemized deductions may differ from federal. |
