## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Vermont starts from **federal taxable income** (Form 1040, Line 15). This is AFTER the federal standard deduction (or itemized deductions) and the QBI deduction.

**Flow:**
1. Federal Form 1040 is completed (including Schedule C, SE, and all deductions).
2. Federal taxable income (Line 15) flows to Vermont Form IN-111, Line 1.
3. Vermont additions are applied (Form IN-112) — rare for most sole proprietors.
4. Vermont subtractions are applied (Form IN-113) — e.g., interest from US obligations.
5. Vermont taxable income is computed.
6. Vermont tax is computed using the rate schedule for the filing status.
7. Credits (earned income credit, renter credit, etc.) are applied.

**Key structural point:** Because Vermont starts from federal taxable income, both the federal standard deduction AND the QBI deduction are already subtracted. Vermont does not apply its own standard deduction — it piggybacks on the federal amount.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment tax deduction
The federal deduction for 50% of self-employment tax reduces federal AGI → reduces federal taxable income → flows through to Vermont automatically.

### Retirement contributions
SEP-IRA, SIMPLE IRA, solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI → flow through automatically.

### Health insurance deduction
The self-employed health insurance deduction reduces federal AGI → flows through automatically.

### QBI deduction (§199A)
Vermont conforms — the QBI deduction is included in federal taxable income (it reduces FTI), so it benefits the Vermont computation. No add-back.

### Home office deduction
Reduces Schedule C net profit → reduces federal AGI → reduces federal taxable income → flows through.

### Estimated tax payments
Vermont requires estimated payments if expected tax liability (after credits and withholding) exceeds $500. Due dates follow federal: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**[T1-VT-1] Tax computation.** Apply the graduated rate schedule to Vermont taxable income based on filing status. Use the Vermont rate schedules or tax tables published annually by the Department of Taxes.

**[T1-VT-2] Starting point.** Begin with federal taxable income from Form 1040, Line 15. Enter on Form IN-111, Line 1.

**[T1-VT-3] Vermont additions (Form IN-112).** Common additions:
- State and local bond interest from non-Vermont issuers (if excluded federally — rare since most muni interest is excluded from federal AGI, not TI)
- Capital gains exclusion recapture (Vermont does not conform to certain federal exclusions)
- IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation add-back (Vermont decoupled — requires add-back and substitution of VT depreciation)

**[T1-VT-4] Vermont subtractions (Form IN-113).** Common subtractions:
- Interest from US government obligations (Treasury bonds, savings bonds)
- Vermont depreciation allowance (replacement for disallowed federal bonus depreciation)
- 40% capital gains exclusion on qualifying Vermont assets held 3+ years (32 V.S.A. §5811(21))

**[T1-VT-5] Vermont Earned Income Credit.** 38% of the federal Earned Income Credit (fully refundable). Claimed on IN-111. If the taxpayer qualifies for federal EIC, they automatically qualify for VT EIC.

**[T1-VT-6] Filing due date.** April 15 following the tax year (April 15, 2026 for TY 2025). Extension: October 15 (automatic with federal, no separate VT form needed). Payment is still due by April 15.

**[T1-VT-7] Estimated tax payments.** Required if expected VT tax liability after withholding and credits exceeds $500. Quarterly due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15. Form IN-114 (voucher).

**[T1-VT-8] Use tax reporting.** Form IN-111 includes a line for reporting use tax on out-of-state purchases. Self-employed individuals who purchase equipment/supplies online without VT sales tax should report use tax here.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**[T2-VT-1] Residency determination.** Vermont defines a resident as a person domiciled in Vermont or maintaining a permanent home in Vermont and spending 183+ days there. Domicile requires intent analysis. Freelancers splitting time between VT and another state need careful documentation.

**[T2-VT-2] Bonus depreciation add-back.** Vermont requires add-back of federal §168(k) bonus depreciation and substitutes its own depreciation schedule. This creates timing differences. Reviewer must track the Vermont depreciation schedule separately and ensure proper subtraction in subsequent years.

**[T2-VT-3] Capital gains exclusion.** Vermont allows a 40% exclusion on net long-term capital gains from the sale of qualifying Vermont-connected assets held for 3+ years. The asset must be a business, farm, or rental property located in Vermont, or an interest in certain Vermont businesses. Reviewer must verify the asset qualifies.

**[T2-VT-4] Multi-state credit.** Vermont allows a credit for income taxes paid to other states/jurisdictions. The credit is the lesser of: (a) tax paid to the other state, or (b) Vermont tax attributable to the income taxed by the other state. Requires careful allocation for multi-state freelancers.

**[T2-VT-5] Renter credit / property tax credit.** Vermont offers a property tax credit (via HS-122) and renter credit for eligible residents. Income limits and homestead value limits apply. These interact with overall VT tax liability.
