## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** Iowa begins with federal adjusted gross income (AGI) from federal Form 1040, Line 11. However, Iowa then applies its own set of adjustments that differ significantly from the federal below-the-line computation.

### Key Iowa adjustments (increases to income)
- Federal net operating loss (NOL) deduction claimed on federal return (Iowa has its own NOL rules)
- Capital gain deduction claimed on IA 1040 (add back if not qualifying)

### Key Iowa adjustments (decreases to income)
- Iowa capital gain deduction: qualifying sales of real property used in farming/business (100% exclusion if held 10+ years and certain conditions met)
- Pension/retirement income exclusion: up to $6,000 per person ($12,000 MFJ) for taxpayers age 55+
- Social Security benefits: Iowa fully excludes Social Security from taxable income
- Military retirement pay: fully excluded
- Interest on U.S. government obligations

### Iowa-specific deductions
After computing Iowa net income, subtract:
- Iowa standard deduction OR Iowa itemized deductions
- Qualified business income (QBI) deduction (Iowa allows the federal §199A deduction as a separate line item)

### Net result
Federal AGI ± Iowa adjustments = Iowa net income → minus Iowa standard/itemized deduction → minus QBI deduction = Iowa taxable income → × 3.8% = Iowa tax → minus credits (including personal exemption credits).

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
Iowa specifically allows the federal QBI deduction (§199A) as a below-the-line deduction on Form IA 1040, Line 1e. This reduces Iowa taxable income.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI. Flows through to Iowa automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI. No Iowa add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI. Flows through automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form IA 1040-ES)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $200 or more.

Voucher due dates: April 30, June 30, September 30, January 31.

**Note:** Iowa's due dates differ from federal (April 30, not April 15).

Safe harbor: No penalty if payments equal at least 90% of current year tax OR 100% of prior year tax (110% if prior year Iowa AGI > $150,000).

### Iowa capital gain deduction
Sole proprietors who sell qualifying Iowa business assets held for 10+ years may exclude 100% of the gain. This is a significant benefit for long-held business property. Requirements:
- Asset must be real property used in a farming operation, or
- Asset must be qualifying business stock/partnership interest
- Various holding period and material participation requirements apply
