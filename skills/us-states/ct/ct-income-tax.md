## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rates (TY 2025)

Connecticut uses a complex progressive system with 7 brackets, plus a personal exemption phase-out (Table C) and tax recapture (Table D) for higher incomes.

**Single and Married Filing Separately (Table B — Initial Tax Calculation):**

| CT taxable income | Tax |
|---|---|
| $0 – $10,000 | 2.00% of amount |
| $10,001 – $50,000 | $200 + 4.50% of excess over $10,000 |
| $50,001 – $100,000 | $2,000 + 5.50% of excess over $50,000 |
| $100,001 – $200,000 | $4,750 + 6.00% of excess over $100,000 |
| $200,001 – $250,000 | $10,750 + 6.50% of excess over $200,000 |
| $250,001 – $500,000 | $14,000 + 6.90% of excess over $250,000 |
| Over $500,000 | $31,250 + 6.99% of excess over $500,000 |

**Married Filing Jointly / Qualifying Surviving Spouse:**

| CT taxable income | Tax |
|---|---|
| $0 – $20,000 | 2.00% of amount |
| $20,001 – $100,000 | $400 + 4.50% of excess over $20,000 |
| $100,001 – $200,000 | $4,000 + 5.50% of excess over $100,000 |
| $200,001 – $400,000 | $9,500 + 6.00% of excess over $200,000 |
| $400,001 – $500,000 | $21,500 + 6.50% of excess over $400,000 |
| $500,001 – $1,000,000 | $28,000 + 6.90% of excess over $500,000 |
| Over $1,000,000 | $62,500 + 6.99% of excess over $1,000,000 |

**Head of Household:**

| CT taxable income | Tax |
|---|---|
| $0 – $16,000 | 2.00% of amount |
| $16,001 – $80,000 | $320 + 4.50% of excess over $16,000 |
| $80,001 – $160,000 | $3,200 + 5.50% of excess over $80,000 |
| $160,001 – $320,000 | $7,600 + 6.00% of excess over $160,000 |
| $320,001 – $400,000 | $17,200 + 6.50% of excess over $320,000 |
| $400,001 – $800,000 | $22,400 + 6.90% of excess over $400,000 |
| Over $800,000 | $50,000 + 6.99% of excess over $800,000 |

### Personal exemption (not a standard deduction)

Connecticut does **not** have a standard deduction. Instead, it uses a personal exemption that phases out at higher income levels:

| Filing status | Maximum personal exemption | Phase-out begins (CT AGI) |
|---|---|---|
| Single | $15,000 | $30,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $24,000 | $48,000 |
| Head of Household | $19,000 | $38,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $12,000 | $24,000 |

The exemption is reduced by $1,000 for each $1,000 (or fraction) of CT AGI above the phase-out threshold, until fully phased out.

### Additional tax adjustments
- **Table C:** 2% phase-out add-back applied at higher income levels.
- **Table D:** Tax recapture for highest earners (effectively increases marginal rate).

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

1. **Starting point:** Connecticut begins with **federal adjusted gross income** (federal Form 1040, Line 11).
2. **Connecticut additions (Schedule 1):** Add back amounts deducted federally but not recognized by CT (e.g., interest on non-Connecticut state/local obligations, certain lump-sum distributions).
3. **Connecticut subtractions (Schedule 1):** Subtract CT-exempt income (e.g., social security benefits, military retirement pay, interest on U.S. obligations, exempt pension income).
4. **Connecticut AGI:** Federal AGI ± additions – subtractions = CT AGI (Line 5).
5. **Income tax calculation:** Apply Table B rates to CT AGI (no deductions subtracted first — CT does not have a standard deduction).
6. **Personal exemption:** Applied as a tax credit reduction (Table A), not a subtraction from income.
7. **Phase-out and recapture:** Apply Table C (2% add-back) and Table D (recapture) if applicable.
8. **Result:** CT income tax after adjustments.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity
- Connecticut generally conforms to the IRC for computing federal AGI.
- Schedule C business deductions flow through federal AGI into Connecticut's computation.

### QBI deduction (§199A)
- The federal QBI deduction is taken below the line on the federal return and does **not** affect federal AGI. Therefore, it does not reduce Connecticut's starting point (CT begins from federal AGI). Connecticut does not have its own QBI equivalent.

### SE health insurance deduction
- Flows through federal AGI (above-the-line deduction) and is automatically reflected in CT's starting point.

### Retirement contributions
- SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI and therefore reduce CT starting income.

### Home office deduction
- Federal home office deduction flows through Schedule C → federal AGI → CT.

### Estimated tax payments (Form CT-1040ES)

- **Threshold:** Must pay estimated tax if you expect CT income tax (after withholding and PE Tax Credit) ≥ $1,000 AND withholding < required annual payment.
- **Required annual payment:** Lesser of 90% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax.
- **Due dates:** April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
- **Payment methods:** myconneCT portal (portal.ct.gov/DRS-myconneCT), credit card, or mail Form CT-1040ES to DRS.
- **Underpayment penalty:** Interest charged on underpayment (Form CT-2210).

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| # | Rule | Logic |
|---|---|---|
| T1-01 | Apply Table B rates to CT AGI | Graduated rates by filing status (7 brackets: 2%–6.99%) |
| T1-02 | Personal exemption (Table A) | Based on filing status and CT AGI; phases out |
| T1-03 | No standard deduction | CT does not allow a standard deduction — only personal exemption |
| T1-04 | Social Security benefits subtracted | If included in federal AGI, full subtraction allowed |
| T1-05 | Estimated tax threshold | CT tax after withholding/credits ≥ $1,000 |
| T1-06 | Filing threshold | Single: CT AGI > $15,000; MFJ: > $24,000; HOH: > $19,000; MFS: > $12,000 |
| T1-07 | Use tax reporting | Schedule 4 on CT-1040 for online purchases without sales tax |

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| # | Rule | Why judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| T2-01 | Table C 2% phase-out add-back | Complex calculation based on CT AGI relative to thresholds |
| T2-02 | Table D tax recapture | Additional tax for highest earners; requires careful computation |
| T2-03 | Pass-Through Entity Tax Credit | If business operates as PTE making CT PE tax payments, taxpayer claims credit |
| T2-04 | Part-year/nonresident allocation | Requires Form CT-1040NR/PY and income sourcing |
| T2-05 | Credit for taxes paid to other states | Schedule 2 on CT-1040; requires documentation |
| T2-06 | Pension/annuity income exemption | Complex eligibility based on age, income type, and CT AGI thresholds |
| T2-07 | CT earned income tax credit (CT EITC) | 40% of federal EITC; phased out at higher income |
