## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Rhode Island starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** on federal Form 1040, Line 11. Rhode Island then applies modifications (additions and subtractions) to arrive at RI modified AGI, then subtracts the RI standard deduction (or itemized, if applicable) and personal exemptions to arrive at RI taxable income.

**Key flow:**

1. Federal AGI → RI modifications (Schedule M) → RI modified AGI
2. RI modified AGI − standard or itemized deduction − exemptions = RI taxable income
3. Apply tax rates → RI tax before credits
4. Apply credits → RI income tax liability

### Important: RI Schedule HR1 (new for 2025)

For tax year 2025, Rhode Island introduced **Schedule HR1** to handle OBBBA-related add-backs. This schedule requires taxpayers to add back certain deductions claimed on the federal return under P.L. 119-21 (OBBBA), including:

- Business interest expense deduction under §163(j) (if changed by OBBBA)
- §174A amortization adjustment for R&E expenditures
- §179(b) expensing limit increase
- Qualified sound recording production deduction under §181

---

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### RI modifications for self-employed

**Common additions (RI taxes, federal does not):**
- State/local income tax refund (if not already in federal AGI)
- OBBBA-related add-backs via Schedule HR1

**Common subtractions (RI exempts, federal taxes):**
- Social Security benefits (RI provides a subtraction for Social Security for taxpayers below certain income thresholds — verify 2025 rules, as RI recently expanded this)
- Certain military pension income

### Rhode Island EITC

Rhode Island provides an earned income tax credit equal to 16% of the federal EITC for tax year 2025. The credit is partially refundable — 15% of the credit is refundable. Self-employment income qualifies.

### RI itemized deduction rules

If the taxpayer itemizes, Rhode Island uses the federal itemized deduction amount as a starting point. Rhode Island does NOT impose its own SALT cap. Taxpayers who itemize on the RI return generally use their federal Schedule A total (with RI-specific modifications if any).

---

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

**R-RI-1. Federal AGI is the starting point.** RI-1040 starts from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

**R-RI-2. Uniform rate schedule applies to all filing statuses.** Unlike most states, RI uses the same tax brackets regardless of filing status. Only the standard deduction and exemption amounts vary by status.

**R-RI-3. Standard deduction is based on filing status.** $10,900 (single/MFS), $21,800 (MFJ/QSS), $16,350 (HOH) for 2025.

**R-RI-4. Personal exemption is $5,100 per person.** Subject to income-based phase-out for high earners.

**R-RI-5. RI EITC = 16% of federal EITC.** Partially refundable (15% of the credit is the refundable portion). Self-employment income qualifies.

**R-RI-6. Schedule HR1 is mandatory for OBBBA add-backs.** If the taxpayer claimed any OBBBA-specific deductions on the federal return (§163(j), §174A, §179(b) increase, §181), complete Schedule HR1 to add these back.

**R-RI-7. Tax tables for income under $100,000.** Use the RI tax tables for taxable income under $100,000; use the tax computation worksheet for $100,000 and above.

---

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

**J-RI-1. Social Security exemption eligibility.** Rhode Island has been expanding its Social Security exemption. Verify the 2025 income thresholds for the Social Security subtraction — it may now be available to a wider range of taxpayers than in prior years.

**J-RI-2. OBBBA conformity determination.** Rhode Island introduced Schedule HR1 to decouple from specific OBBBA provisions. Judgment is needed to determine exactly which federal deductions were claimed under OBBBA and must be added back.

**J-RI-3. Residency determination.** RI considers a person domiciled in RI or maintaining a permanent place of abode in RI while spending 183+ days there as a resident. For taxpayers who moved, nonresident/part-year rules apply.

**J-RI-4. Property tax credit eligibility.** The RI property tax circuit breaker credit has specific income and property tax thresholds. Verify eligibility.

## Section 7: Supplier pattern library

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| OBBBA filer | Must complete Schedule HR1 to add back OBBBA-specific deductions (§163(j), §174A, §179(b), §181). |
| Low-income freelancer with children | Check eligibility for RI EITC (16% of federal) and RI child tax credit ($500/child under 6). |
| Social Security recipient | Verify eligibility for RI Social Security subtraction based on income thresholds. |
| High earner (>$181,650) | Top bracket at 5.99%. Plus personal exemption phase-out may apply. |
| Standard vs. itemized | RI standard deduction is relatively generous ($10,900 single). Compare against itemized before choosing. |

## Section 9: Refusal catalogue

**REFUSE-RI-1.** REFUSE to prepare a RI return for a part-year resident or nonresident without Form RI-1040NR. This skill covers full-year residents only.

**REFUSE-RI-2.** REFUSE to skip Schedule HR1 if the taxpayer claimed any OBBBA-specific deductions on the federal return. The schedule is mandatory for 2025.

**REFUSE-RI-3.** REFUSE to claim the Social Security subtraction without verifying income eligibility thresholds for 2025.

**REFUSE-RI-4.** REFUSE to apply 2026 inflation-adjusted brackets ($82,050 / $186,450) to a 2025 return. Use the 2025 brackets ($79,900 / $181,650).
