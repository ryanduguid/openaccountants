## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### CAT rate and exclusion by year

| Calendar year | Exclusion amount | Annual minimum tax | Tax rate on TGR above exclusion | Filing required? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pre-2024 | $1,000,000 | $150 – $2,600 (tiered) | 0.26% | TGR > $150,000 |
| 2024 | $3,000,000 | Eliminated | 0.26% | TGR > $3,000,000 |
| 2025 and after | $6,000,000 | Eliminated | 0.26% | TGR > $6,000,000 |

### What this means for most sole proprietors

The vast majority of sole proprietors will **not** owe any CAT starting in 2025. Only businesses with more than $6 million in Ohio taxable gross receipts are subject to the tax. A typical sole proprietor or freelancer with annual revenue well under $6 million has no CAT obligation.

### CAT computation formula (2025+)

```
If Ohio TGR ≤ $6,000,000:
  CAT = $0 (no filing required)

If Ohio TGR > $6,000,000:
  CAT = 0.26% × (Ohio TGR − $6,000,000)
```

## Section 3: Key concepts

### What are "taxable gross receipts"?

Taxable gross receipts (TGR) include all gross receipts sitused to Ohio, with limited exclusions. For a sole proprietor, this generally means total revenue from sales of goods or services to Ohio customers.

**Included:**
- Revenue from sale of goods/services to Ohio customers
- Gross receipts from Ohio-sitused transactions (based on where the customer receives the benefit)

**Excluded (not exhaustive):**
- Receipts from sales of motor fuel (subject to motor fuel tax)
- Receipts from sales of a business or substantial assets in a single transaction
- Interest income from federal obligations
- Certain insurance premiums
- Receipts from qualifying exempt organizations

### Situsing rules

- **Tangible personal property:** Sitused to Ohio if delivered to or received by the customer in Ohio.
- **Services:** Sitused to Ohio if the benefit of the service is received in Ohio.
- **Real property:** Sitused to Ohio if the property is in Ohio.

### Relationship to Ohio income tax

The CAT is a separate tax from Ohio income tax. It is a **gross receipts tax**, not an income tax. A business may owe both CAT and Ohio income tax. CAT payments are NOT deductible on the Ohio income tax return (ORC § 5747.01(A) excludes the CAT from the definition of "taxes" for deduction purposes). However, CAT payments may be deductible on the federal return as a business expense.

## Section 4: Filing requirements (2025+)

### Registration

- Businesses must register for CAT within 30 days of exceeding $6 million in Ohio TGR.
- Registration is done via the Ohio Business Gateway or Form CAT 1.
- Failure to register timely: penalty of up to $100/month, not to exceed $1,000.

### Filing frequency

- **Quarterly returns only** (annual filing was eliminated after the 2023 annual return).
- Quarterly returns are due by the last day of the second month after the quarter ends.

| Quarter | Period | Due date |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | Jan 1 – Mar 31 | May 10 |
| Q2 | Apr 1 – Jun 30 | Aug 10 |
| Q3 | Jul 1 – Sep 30 | Nov 10 |
| Q4 | Oct 1 – Dec 31 | Feb 10 (following year) |

### Cancellation

Businesses with $6 million or less in TGR for 2025 can cancel their CAT account via the Ohio Business Gateway or by submitting a Business Account Update Form (BA-UF). A final return is required.

## Section 5: 2024 reform summary (HB 33)

Am. Sub. HB 33 of the 135th Ohio General Assembly made the following changes:

1. **Exclusion amount tripled (2024):** Increased from $1 million to $3 million.
2. **Exclusion amount doubled again (2025+):** Increased to $6 million.
3. **Annual minimum tax eliminated:** The tiered minimum tax ($150–$2,600) was eliminated entirely starting 2024.
4. **Annual filing eliminated:** Only quarterly returns are accepted for tax periods beginning 2024+.
5. **Tax rate unchanged:** The 0.26% rate was NOT changed.

**Net effect:** Approximately 90% of previously filing CAT taxpayers are now exempt from the tax.

## Section 6: Refusal catalogue

**REFUSE-CAT-1.** REFUSE to prepare a CAT return for a combined/consolidated group without complete group member information. Combined reporting for affiliated groups requires specialized handling.

**REFUSE-CAT-2.** REFUSE to determine situsing for complex multi-state service transactions without reviewer guidance. The benefit-of-the-service-received test can be ambiguous for services provided remotely.

**REFUSE-CAT-3.** REFUSE to advise on whether a specific receipt category is excluded from TGR without confirming against ORC § 5751.01(F)(2) exclusion list.
