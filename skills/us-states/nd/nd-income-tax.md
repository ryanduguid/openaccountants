## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

North Dakota taxable income starts with **federal taxable income** from federal Form 1040, Line 15 (not federal AGI — this is different from many other states).

1. **Start with federal taxable income** → ND-1, Line 1
2. **Add ND additions** (Schedule ND-1SA) — items ND adds back
3. **Subtract ND subtractions** (Schedule ND-1SA) — items ND excludes
4. **Result = ND taxable income**
5. **Apply the graduated rate schedule** → ND tax
6. **Subtract credits** (Schedule ND-1TC) → final tax due or refund

### Key addition modifications (Schedule ND-1SA)

| Addition | Description |
|---|---|
| State/local bond interest | Interest from bonds of states other than ND |
| State income tax refund adjustment | If federal treatment differs from ND |

### Key subtraction modifications (Schedule ND-1SA)

| Subtraction | Description |
|---|---|
| US government bond interest | Interest from US Treasury obligations |
| Native American reservation income | Income earned by enrolled members on their reservation |
| ND Renaissance Zone income | Income from activity in a designated Renaissance Zone |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income flow

Schedule C net profit flows into federal taxable income, which is the starting point for ND. Because ND starts from federal taxable income (after the standard/itemized deduction and QBI deduction), the federal deductions are already incorporated.

### Estimated tax

ND requires estimated tax payments if you expect your ND net tax liability to be **$1,000 or more**.

| Installment | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form ND-1ES is used for estimated tax payments. Payments can be made via the North Dakota Taxpayer Access Point (ND TAP).

### Depreciation

ND generally conforms to federal depreciation rules, including IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation. No state-level add-back is required for bonus depreciation.

### 0% bracket benefit

The 0% first bracket means that a single filer with ND taxable income of $48,475 or less (or MFJ of $80,975 or less) owes **zero** ND income tax. This is particularly beneficial for self-employed taxpayers with moderate income.
