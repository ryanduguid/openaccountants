| Single / Married filing separately | $15,000 |
| Head of household | $22,500 |
| Married filing jointly / Qualifying surviving spouse | $30,000 |

Additional standard deduction: $1,600 ($2,000 if single/HoH) for taxpayers born before January 2, 1961, or who are blind.

| Single / Married filing separately | $15,000 |
| Married filing jointly | $30,000 |

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

**Starting point:** DC begins with federal adjusted gross income (AGI) from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

### Key additions to DC income (Schedule S)
- Franchise tax deducted on federal return
- State/local income tax refunds not already in federal AGI (if applicable)
- Any DC-decoupled items (e.g., §174A R&E immediate expensing — DC decoupled effective 2025)

### Key subtractions from DC income (Schedule S)
- DC government pension/annuity exclusion (up to $3,000 for qualifying recipients)
- Social Security benefits (DC does not tax Social Security)
- Income earned by DC National Guard members on active duty

### Net result
Federal AGI ± DC modifications = DC adjusted gross income → minus standard or itemized deduction = DC taxable income → apply rate table.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### QBI conformity
DC starts from federal AGI. The federal QBI deduction (§199A) is taken below AGI on the federal return (line 13 of Form 1040) and does NOT flow into DC's computation. DC taxable income is computed independently from federal taxable income.

### SE health insurance deduction
Already reflected in federal AGI (Form 1040, Schedule 1, Line 17). Flows through to DC automatically.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, solo 401(k))
Already reflected in federal AGI. No DC add-back required.

### Home office deduction
Already reflected in Schedule C → federal AGI. Flows through to DC automatically.

### Estimated tax (Form D-40ES)
Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $100 or more after credits and withholding. Voucher due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.

Safe harbor: No penalty if payments equal at least 110% of prior year DC tax liability OR at least 90% of current year tax.

### DC Unincorporated Business Franchise Tax (Form D-30)
Self-employed individuals and sole proprietors with DC gross receipts exceeding $12,000 may also owe the DC unincorporated business franchise tax (currently 9.75% on net income over $12,000). **This skill does NOT compute the D-30.** That is a separate obligation. However, any D-30 franchise tax paid is deductible as a business expense on the federal Schedule C and flows through to reduce federal AGI.

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| Rule ID | Rule |
|---|---|
| DC-IT-1.01 | DC taxable income = DC AGI minus DC standard deduction (or itemized deductions if elected) |
| DC-IT-1.02 | Apply the seven-bracket rate schedule to DC taxable income to compute DC tax |
| DC-IT-1.03 | If DC taxable income ≤ $100,000, use tax tables; if > $100,000, use tax computation worksheet |
| DC-IT-1.04 | Standard deduction election must match itemized/standard choice concept but DC sets its own amounts independently of federal |
| DC-IT-1.05 | Social Security benefits are fully excluded from DC taxable income |
| DC-IT-1.06 | DC EITC = 70% of federal EITC (refundable) — applies for tax year 2025 |
| DC-IT-1.07 | Property tax credit (Schedule H) available if household gross income < $50,000 and DC homeowner/renter |
| DC-IT-1.08 | Estimated tax penalty applies if total payments < 90% of current year tax AND < 110% of prior year tax |

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Rule | Judgment needed |
|---|---|---|
| DC-IT-2.01 | Standard vs. itemized deduction election | Compare DC standard deduction to DC allowable itemized deductions; note DC decouples from certain federal itemization rules |
| DC-IT-2.02 | DC Schedule N (apportionment) for multi-state income | If taxpayer has income from sources outside DC, apportionment may apply |
| DC-IT-2.03 | D-30 filing obligation | Determine if gross receipts exceed $12,000 threshold; if so, refer to separate D-30 skill |
| DC-IT-2.04 | DC conformity with federal depreciation | DC decoupled from §168(k) bonus depreciation and §174A R&E — reviewer must verify add-back |
