## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

Minnesota taxable income begins with **federal taxable income** (Form 1040, Line 15 — after the federal standard or itemized deduction).

1. **Additions (Schedule M1M)** — Add back items Minnesota does not allow (e.g., state income tax deducted federally on Schedule A, certain bonus depreciation, IRC § 199A QBI deduction).
2. **Subtractions (Schedule M1M)** — Subtract items Minnesota excludes (e.g., state income tax refund included in federal income, U.S. government bond interest, Social Security subtraction for qualifying taxpayers, K-12 education credit subtraction).
3. **Minnesota taxable income** — Federal taxable income + additions − subtractions.
4. **Tax** — Apply the four graduated rates to Minnesota taxable income.
5. **Credits** — Apply applicable credits.

**Key difference from many states:** Minnesota starts from federal **taxable income** (after the standard/itemized deduction), not from federal AGI. This means the federal standard deduction and itemized deductions are already factored in. Minnesota then applies its own standard deduction or uses the federal amounts depending on the schedule.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

1. **Self-employment income** flows through federal Schedule C → federal AGI → federal taxable income → Minnesota taxable income (with additions/subtractions).
2. **Federal SE tax deduction** — Already reflected in federal AGI and thus in federal taxable income. No separate Minnesota adjustment.
3. **QBI deduction add-back** — Minnesota requires an addition for the federal qualified business income deduction (IRC § 199A) if it was claimed on the federal return.
4. **Estimated taxes** — Self-employed taxpayers must make quarterly estimated payments (Form M1, Schedule M14) if expected liability exceeds $500 after withholding and credits. Due dates: April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.
5. **Business equipment depreciation** — Minnesota requires addition of federal bonus depreciation (IRC § 168(k)) and substitution of straight-line MACRS depreciation (§ 168(a)). This creates a timing difference tracked on Schedule M1AR.
6. **Health insurance deduction** — Self-employed health insurance deduction is in federal AGI. No Minnesota add-back.
7. **No local income tax** — Minnesota does not have any local or city income taxes.
