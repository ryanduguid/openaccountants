## Step 0: Client Onboarding Questions

**Client Onboarding Questions**

| # | Question | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Do you have a Virginia sales tax registration / tax ID? | Determines whether registration is needed before filing. |
| 2 | What is your current filing frequency (monthly / quarterly / annually)? | Controls which return periods to prepare. |
| 3 | What is your nexus type -- physical presence, economic nexus, or both? | Determines registration obligations and applicable rules. |
| 4 | Are you a marketplace seller (selling through Amazon, Etsy, etc.)? | Marketplace facilitator may already be collecting on your behalf. |
| 5 | What types of products or services do you sell in Virginia? | Drives taxability classification under Virginia law. |
| 6 | Do you sell to exempt entities (government, nonprofits, resellers)? | Determines whether exemption certificates must be collected and retained. |
| 7 | Do you have locations, employees, or inventory in Virginia? | Physical presence creates nexus independent of economic thresholds. |
| 8 | Do you sell into multiple Virginia local jurisdictions? | Local tax rates vary; determines compliance complexity. |

**If the client cannot answer questions 1-4, STOP and gather this information before proceeding.** [T1]

## Step 1: Tax Rate Structure

### 1.1 Standard Rate Composition

**Standard Rate Composition**

| Component | Rate | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State tax | 4.3% | Va. Code Section 58.1-603 |
| Local tax (mandatory statewide) | 1.0% | Va. Code Section 58.1-605 |
| **Standard combined rate** | **5.3%** |  |

Virginia's sales tax has a **mandatory local component** built into the rate structure, unlike most states:

### 1.2 Regional Rates

**Regional Rates**

| Region | Additional Rate | Total Rate | Authority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Northern Virginia (NOVA) | 0.7% (regional transport) | **6.0%** | Va. Code Section 58.1-603.1 |
| Hampton Roads | 0.7% (regional transport) + 1.0% (additional regional) | **7.0%** | Va. Code Section 58.1-603.1; HB 1414 (2020) |
| Central Virginia (Richmond metro) | 0.7% (regional transport) | **6.0%** | Va. Code Section 58.1-603.1 |
| Rest of Virginia | None | **5.3%** | Standard rate |

- **Northern Virginia jurisdictions** — Northern Virginia jurisdictions (6.0%): Arlington, Fairfax, Loudoun, Prince William counties; cities of Alexandria, Fairfax, Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park. (T1)
- **Hampton Roads jurisdictions** — Hampton Roads jurisdictions (7.0%): Chesapeake, Hampton, Isle of Wight, James City, Newport News, Norfolk, Poquoson, Portsmouth, Suffolk, Virginia Beach, Williamsburg, York. (T1)

### 1.3 Sourcing Rules [T1]

- **Intrastate sales sourcing** — Intrastate sales: Sourced to the seller's location for over-the-counter sales. For shipped goods, sourced to the destination. (T1)
- **Interstate sales sourcing** — Interstate sales (remote sellers): Destination-based. (T1)
- **Delivered sales sourcing** — Delivered sales: Destination-based (the delivery address determines the rate). (T1)

Virginia is generally an **origin-based** sourcing state for intrastate sales.

**Important:** Because Virginia has regional rate differences, the sourcing determination directly affects the rate. A seller in Northern Virginia (6%) shipping to Hampton Roads (7%) charges the 7% rate. [T1]

## Step 2: Transaction Classification Rules

### 2.1 General Rule

- **General rule** — Virginia sales tax applies to the retail sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property and certain enumerated services.  _(Va. Code Section 58.1-603)_

### 2.3 Grocery Food -- Critical 2023 Change [T1]

- **Grocery food before 2023** — Before Jan 1, 2023: Grocery food was taxed at 2.5% (1.5% state + 1% local). (T1)  _(HB 90 / SB 451 (2022 Session); Va. Code Section 58.1-611.1)_

### 2.4 SaaS Taxability -- Virginia's Position [T2]

- **SaaS treated as TPP** — Virginia has broadly interpreted its definition of tangible personal property to include electronically delivered software. (T2)  _(Virginia Tax Ruling PD 19-55; Public Document 19-45)_
- **SaaS as taxable lease** — SaaS is treated as a subscription to use software, which Virginia considers a taxable lease of TPP. (T2)  _(Virginia Tax Ruling PD 19-55; Public Document 19-45)_
- **SaaS access method irrelevant** — The tax applies regardless of whether the software is accessed via browser or app. (T2)  _(Virginia Tax Ruling PD 19-55; Public Document 19-45)_
- **IaaS/PaaS unclear** — Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) taxability is less clear and should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. (T3)  _(Virginia Tax Ruling PD 19-55; Public Document 19-45)_

### 2.5 Services Taxability [T2]

**Services Taxability**

| Service | Taxable? | Authority |

- **No quarterly/annual filing** — Virginia does not offer quarterly or annual filing options for general sales tax filers (unlike many states). All registrants file monthly. (T1)

### 3.3 Returns and Payment

- **Form ST-9 primary return** — Form ST-9 (Retail Sales and Use Tax Return) is the primary return. (T1)
- **Return covers state and local** — The return covers both state and local taxes (the local 1% is reported and remitted with the state return). (T1)
- **Electronic filing required** — Electronic filing is required for all filers. (T1)

### 3.4 Dealer's Discount

- **Dealer's discount retention** — Dealers may retain the greater of $0 or an amount computed as follows: On collections of the first $62,500 of taxable sales: 1.6% of tax due. (T1)  _(Va. Code Section 58.1-622)_
- **Maximum discount** — The maximum discount is approximately $53 per month (for monthly filers with sufficient sales volume). (T1)  _(Va. Code Section 58.1-622)_
- **Discount timely filing condition** — The discount is available only if the return is filed and payment is made on time.  _(Va. Code Section 58.1-622)_

## Step 4: Deductibility / Exemptions

### 5.1 Virginia Exemption Certificates

## Step 6: Filing Deadlines and Penalties

Refer to Step 3 for filing frequencies and due dates. [T1]

## Test Suite

### Test 1: Standard Rate Calculation [T1]

**Question:** A retailer in Richmond (Central Virginia, 6.0% total) sells a $1,000 laptop. What is the sales tax?

**Expected Answer:** $1,000 x 6.0% = $60.00.

### Test 2: Grocery Food Rate [T1]

**Question:** A consumer buys $300 of groceries in Virginia Beach (Hampton Roads). What tax is due on the groceries?

**Expected Answer:** After Jan 1, 2023, grocery food is taxed at approximately 1% (local portion only). $300 x 1% = $3.00. The state and regional portions do not apply to grocery food.

### Test 3: SaaS Taxability [T2]

**Question:** A Virginia company subscribes to a $500/month CRM SaaS product. Is Virginia sales tax due?

**Expected Answer:** Yes. Virginia taxes SaaS. At the applicable rate for the company's location (e.g., 5.3% in standard Virginia = $26.50/month; 6.0% in NOVA = $30.00/month; 7.0% in Hampton Roads = $35.00/month).

### Test 4: Regional Rate Determination [T1]

**Question:** An online retailer in Roanoke (5.3%) ships a $200 order to a customer in Arlington (NOVA, 6.0%). What rate applies?

**Expected Answer:** 6.0%. For shipped goods, Virginia uses destination-based sourcing, so the buyer's location rate applies. Tax = $200 x 6.0% = $12.00.

### Test 5: Economic Nexus [T1]

**Question:** An out-of-state seller made $50,000 in sales but 210 transactions into Virginia this year. Does the seller have nexus?

**Expected Answer:** Yes. Virginia uses an OR test. The seller exceeded the 200-transaction threshold, so economic nexus is triggered even though revenue is below $100,000.

### Test 6: Sales Tax Holiday [T1]

**Question:** During Virginia's sales tax holiday in August, a customer buys a $90 pair of shoes and a $110 jacket. Which items qualify?

**Expected Answer:** The $90 shoes qualify (under $100 threshold) and are exempt. The $110 jacket does NOT qualify (exceeds $100 per-item limit) and is taxable at the full applicable rate.

### Test 7: Use Tax on Out-of-State Purchase [T1]

**Question:** A Virginia Beach (7.0%) resident buys a $2,000 piece of furniture online from a seller who charges 4% sales tax (from another state). What Virginia use tax is owed?

**Expected Answer:** Virginia use tax at 7.0% = $140. Credit for tax paid to other state: $2,000 x 4% = $80. Net Virginia use tax owed: $140 - $80 = $60.
