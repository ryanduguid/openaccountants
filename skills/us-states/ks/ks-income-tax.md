## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax brackets (tax year 2024 and thereafter, per K.S.A. 79-32,110(B))

**Single, Head of Household, Married Filing Separately:**

| Taxable income | Rate | Tax calculation |
|---|---|---|
| $0 – $23,000 | 5.20% | 5.20% of Kansas taxable income |
| Over $23,000 | 5.58% | $1,196 + 5.58% of excess over $23,000 |

**Married Filing Jointly:**

| Taxable income | Rate | Tax calculation |
|---|---|---|
| $0 – $46,000 | 5.20% | 5.20% of Kansas taxable income |
| Over $46,000 | 5.58% | $2,392 + 5.58% of excess over $46,000 |

**Note:** These two-bracket rates replaced the prior three-bracket system (3.1% / 5.25% / 5.7%) effective for tax year 2024 under Senate Bill 1 (2024).

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

Kansas starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11. This is entered on Form K-40, Line 1.

### Additions (Schedule S, Part A)

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| State/local income tax refunds | If not already in federal AGI | K.S.A. 79-32,117 |
| Out-of-state municipal bond interest | Interest from bonds of states other than Kansas | K.S.A. 79-32,117(b) |
| IRC §179 / bonus depreciation differences | Kansas may decouple from certain federal accelerated depreciation provisions | K.S.A. 79-32,117 |

### Subtractions (Schedule S, Part A)

| Item | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Kansas state income tax refund | If included in federal AGI (state tax refund recovery) | K.S.A. 79-32,117(a) |
| Social Security benefits | Kansas fully exempts Social Security if federal AGI is $75,000 or less | K.S.A. 79-32,117(c)(viii) |
| U.S. government interest | Interest on U.S. obligations | K.S.A. 79-32,117(a)(i) |
| KPERS contributions | Kansas Public Employees Retirement System contributions | K.S.A. 79-32,117(a)(ii) |
| Military pay | Active-duty military compensation | K.S.A. 79-32,117 |
| Retirement income exclusion | Social Security exempt for AGI ≤ $75,000; other retirement income provisions vary | K.S.A. 79-32,117 |

### Resulting computation

Federal AGI ± Schedule S modifications = Kansas AGI → minus standard or itemized deduction → minus personal exemptions = Kansas taxable income → apply bracket rates.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated tax payments if they expect to owe $500 or more for the year.

| Voucher | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Use Form K-40ES for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance
Kansas follows federal treatment — the deduction reduces federal AGI and flows through.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))
Kansas follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce federal AGI and flow through.

### Home office deduction
Kansas follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C, included in federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)
Kansas does **not** allow the federal QBI deduction because Kansas starts from federal AGI (before the QBI deduction is taken). The QBI deduction does not affect Kansas taxable income.

### Standard vs. itemized deductions
Kansas allows taxpayers to choose between the Kansas standard deduction and Kansas itemized deductions. If itemizing, Kansas generally follows the federal itemized deductions with modifications on Schedule S.
