## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### State income tax rate

**State income tax rate table**  _(KRS 141.020)_

| Tax year | Rate | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | 4.00% | KRS 141.020 |
| 2026 | 3.50% | H.B. 1 (2025); KRS 141.020 as amended |

- **2025** — 4.00%  _(KRS 141.020)_
- **2026** — 3.50%  _(H.B. 1 (2025); KRS 141.020 as amended)_

Kentucky imposes a **flat** income tax rate. There are no graduated brackets. The same rate applies to all filing statuses.

### Standard deduction

**Standard deduction table**  _(KRS 141.081)_

| Tax year | Amount | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2025 | $3,270 | KRS 141.081 |
| 2026 | $3,360 | H.B. 1 (2025); DOR announcement |

- **2025** — $3,270  _(KRS 141.081)_
- **2026** — $3,360  _(H.B. 1 (2025); DOR announcement)_

Kentucky allows either the standard deduction or itemized deductions (not both).

### Personal exemptions

Kentucky provides a personal tax credit rather than a traditional exemption. For TY2025, the credit is $40 per taxpayer. Dependent credits may also apply.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

### Starting point

- **Starting point** — Kentucky starts from **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** — Form 1040, Line 11. This is entered on Form 740, Line 5.

### Additions to income

**Additions to income table**

| Item | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| State/local income tax refunds | If deducted federally and included as income in federal AGI | KRS 141.010 |
| Interest from other states' bonds | Interest on obligations of other states must be added back | KRS 141.010(10) |
| Lump-sum distribution exclusion | If federal exclusion was taken | KRS 141.010 |
| IRC differences | Kentucky decouples from certain post-2017 TCJA provisions — review annually | KRS 141.0101 |

- **State/local income tax refunds** — If deducted federally and included as income in federal AGI  _(KRS 141.010)_
- **Interest from other states' bonds** — Interest on obligations of other states must be added back  _(KRS 141.010(10))_
- **Lump-sum distribution exclusion** — If federal exclusion was taken  _(KRS 141.010)_
- **IRC differences** — Kentucky decouples from certain post-2017 TCJA provisions — review annually  _(KRS 141.0101)_

### Subtractions from income

**Subtractions from income table**

| Item | Description | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| U.S. government interest | Interest on U.S. obligations | KRS 141.010(10)(d) |
| Social Security benefits | Kentucky fully exempts Social Security benefits | KRS 141.019(1)(a) |
| Railroad retirement benefits | Fully exempt | KRS 141.019 |
| Kentucky pension exclusion | Up to $31,110 (2025) for qualifying retirement income | KRS 141.019(1)(l) |
| Military pay | Various exclusions for active-duty service | KRS 141.019 |

- **U.S. government interest** — Interest on U.S. obligations  _(KRS 141.010(10)(d))_
- **Social Security benefits** — Kentucky fully exempts Social Security benefits  _(KRS 141.019(1)(a))_
- **Railroad retirement benefits** — Fully exempt  _(KRS 141.019)_
- **Kentucky pension exclusion** — Up to $31,110 (2025) for qualifying retirement income  _(KRS 141.019(1)(l))_
- **Military pay** — Various exclusions for active-duty service  _(KRS 141.019)_

### Resulting computation

- **KY tax computation** — Federal AGI + additions − subtractions = Kentucky AGI → minus standard or itemized deduction = Kentucky taxable income → times 3.5% (TY2026) = Kentucky tax → minus credits.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Estimated tax payments

- **Estimated payment requirement** — Self-employed individuals must make quarterly estimated payments if they expect to owe $500 or more.

**Estimated tax payments table**

| Voucher | Due date |
| --- | --- |
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

- **1st quarter** — April 15
- **2nd quarter** — June 15
- **3rd quarter** — September 15
- **4th quarter** — January 15 (following year)

Use Form 740-ES for estimated payments.

### Self-employment health insurance

- **SE health insurance treatment** — Kentucky follows federal treatment — the deduction reduces federal AGI and flows through.

### Retirement contributions (SEP, SIMPLE, Solo 401(k))

- **Retirement contribution treatment** — Kentucky follows federal treatment — these deductions reduce federal AGI and flow through.

### Home office deduction

- **Home office treatment** — Kentucky follows the federal home office deduction as part of Schedule C, included in federal AGI.

### QBI deduction (Section 199A)

- **QBI treatment** — Kentucky does **not** allow the federal QBI deduction because Kentucky starts from federal AGI (before the QBI deduction). The QBI deduction does not affect Kentucky taxable income.

### Local occupational taxes

- **Local occupational taxes** — Many Kentucky cities and counties levy local occupational license taxes (e.g., Louisville Metro at ~2.2%, Lexington-Fayette at ~2.25%). These are separate from state income tax and are filed on separate local forms. Self-employed individuals are subject to these taxes on net self-employment income earned within the locality.
