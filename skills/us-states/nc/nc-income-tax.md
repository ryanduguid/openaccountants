## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rate

| Tax year | Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2025 | 4.25% | Session Law 2023-134; NCDOR Tax Rate Schedules |
| 2026 | 3.99% | Session Law 2023-134; NCDOR Tax Rate Schedules |

North Carolina applies a single flat rate to all taxable income regardless of filing status or income level.

### Standard deduction (TY 2025)

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
|---|---|
| Single | $12,750 |
| Married filing jointly | $25,500 |
| Married filing separately | $12,750 |
| Head of household | $19,125 |

### Child deduction (TY 2025)

| NC AGI threshold (MFJ) | Deduction per child |
|---|---|
| Up to $40,000 | $3,000 |
| $40,001 – $60,000 | $2,500 |
| $60,001 – $80,000 | $2,000 |
| $80,001 – $100,000 | $1,500 |
| $100,001 – $120,000 | $1,000 |
| $120,001 – $140,000 | $500 |
| Over $140,000 | $0 |

NC does not have personal exemptions — the child deduction is the only per-dependent benefit.

### Local income tax

North Carolina does **not** permit local income taxes.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

North Carolina taxable income starts with **federal adjusted gross income (AGI)** from federal Form 1040, Line 11.

1. **Start with federal AGI** → D-400, Line 6
2. **Add NC additions** (Schedule S, Part A) — items NC adds back that were excluded or deducted federally
3. **Subtract NC deductions** (Schedule S, Part B) — items NC excludes that were included federally
4. **Result = NC adjusted gross income**
5. **Subtract** the NC standard deduction (or NC itemized deductions) and child deduction
6. **Result = NC taxable income** → multiply by 4.25%
7. **Subtract credits** (D-400TC) → final tax due or refund

### Key addition modifications (Schedule S, Part A)

| Addition | Description |
|---|---|
| Interest from other states' bonds | Interest income from bonds of states other than NC |
| Bonus depreciation add-back | NC does not conform to IRC §168(k) bonus depreciation |
| Section 179 excess | NC limits §179 to $25,000 (does not conform to federal expanded amount) |

### Key subtraction modifications (Schedule S, Part B)

| Subtraction | Description |
|---|---|
| US government bond interest | Interest from US Treasury obligations |
| Retirement benefits (Bailey Settlement) | Certain state/local government retirees exempt per court settlement |
| Social Security | NC does not tax Social Security benefits |

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Self-employment income flow

Schedule C net profit flows into federal AGI, which flows into NC AGI. NC has no separate self-employment tax — the 4.25% rate applies to all taxable income including self-employment income.

### Estimated tax

NC requires estimated tax payments if you expect to owe **$1,000 or more** after subtracting withholding and credits.

| Installment | Due date |
|---|---|
| 1st quarter | April 15 |
| 2nd quarter | June 15 |
| 3rd quarter | September 15 |
| 4th quarter | January 15 (following year) |

Form NC-40 is used for estimated tax payments.

### Depreciation decoupling

NC does not conform to federal bonus depreciation under IRC §168(k). Taxpayers must add back the difference between federal and NC-allowed depreciation on Schedule S. NC follows its own depreciation schedule (generally pre-TCJA rules). This is critical for self-employed taxpayers with significant equipment or vehicle purchases.

### Section 179

NC limits the Section 179 deduction to **$25,000** (not the federal expanded amount). Any excess must be added back on Schedule S.

## Section 6: Tier 2 rules — requires judgment

| Rule ID | Situation | Guidance |
|---|---|---|
| NC-T2-01 | **Multi-state income:** Taxpayer has income from another state | NC taxes all income of residents; credit for taxes paid to other states available on D-400TC. Allocation requires review. |
| NC-T2-02 | **Business vs. hobby determination** | NC follows federal hobby loss rules. If IRS disallows Schedule C, NC deductions are also disallowed. |
| NC-T2-03 | **IRC conformity date changes** | NC references IRC as of a specific date. If federal law changed after NC's conformity date, add-backs or subtractions may be required. Verify conformity date for the tax year. |
| NC-T2-04 | **Home office deduction** | NC conforms to federal home office deduction rules. Flows through federal AGI. No separate NC adjustment needed. |
| NC-T2-05 | **Net operating losses** | NC conforms to federal NOL rules with modifications. Post-2017 NOLs limited to 80% of taxable income. Carryforward only (no carryback). |
