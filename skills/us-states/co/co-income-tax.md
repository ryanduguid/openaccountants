## Section 2: Quick reference — rates and thresholds

### Tax rate (TY 2025)

- **All statuses** — 4.4%  _(All Colorado taxable income)_

**Tax rate table (TY 2025)**

| Filing status | Rate | Applies to |
| --- | --- | --- |
| All statuses | 4.4% | All Colorado taxable income |

Colorado imposes a **flat income tax rate of 4.4%** on all Colorado taxable income, regardless of filing status or income level. The rate was reduced from 4.55% (TY 2024) to 4.4% (TY 2025) through TABOR-related adjustments.

### Standard deduction

- **Married Filing Separately** — $15,000
- **Married Filing Jointly** — $30,000
- **Married Filing Separately** — $15,000
- **Head of Household** — $22,500

**Standard deduction table (TY 2025)**

| Filing status | Standard deduction |
| --- | --- |
| Single | $15,000 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $30,000 |
| Married Filing Separately | $15,000 |
| Head of Household | $22,500 |

Colorado uses the **federal standard deduction** amounts. For TY 2025: (These are the federal amounts; Colorado taxable income starts from federal taxable income, which already incorporates the federal standard deduction or itemized deductions.)

### TABOR refunds

Colorado's Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR) limits state revenue growth. When revenue exceeds limits, taxpayers receive refunds. These refunds are typically claimed on the DR 0104 or issued automatically.

## Section 3: How this skill works with the federal return

- **Starting point** — Colorado begins with federal taxable income (federal Form 1040, Line 15). This is unusual — most states start from federal AGI.  _(Federal Form 1040, Line 15)_
- **Colorado additions (DR 0104AD)** — Add back amounts deducted federally but not recognized by Colorado (e.g., state income tax refund if previously deducted, certain bond interest from other states).  _(DR 0104AD)_
- **Colorado subtractions (DR 0104AD)** — Subtract Colorado-exempt income (e.g., Social Security benefits for age 55+, PERA/DPS pension income, U.S. government interest, Colorado-source capital gains subtraction).  _(DR 0104AD)_
- **Colorado tax result** — Colorado taxable income × 4.4% = Colorado tax.

**Key implication:** Because Colorado starts from federal taxable income, the federal standard deduction (or itemized deductions) is already incorporated. Taxpayers cannot separately choose between standard/itemized for Colorado — they must use whatever they chose federally.

## Section 4: Self-employed specific rules

### Federal conformity

- **Federal conformity rules** — Colorado is a strong conformity state — it starts from federal taxable income, so nearly all federal provisions automatically flow through. Schedule C business deductions, above-the-line deductions, and the QBI deduction (§199A) all flow through to Colorado because they reduce federal taxable income.

### QBI deduction (§199A)

- **QBI deduction flow-through** — Fully flows through to Colorado because Colorado starts from federal taxable income (Line 15), which is calculated after the QBI deduction.  _(§199A)_

### SE health insurance deduction

- **SE health insurance deduction flow-through** — Reduces federal AGI (above-the-line), ultimately reducing federal taxable income, which flows to Colorado.

### Retirement contributions

- **Retirement contributions flow-through** — SEP-IRA and Solo 401(k) contributions reduce federal AGI → federal taxable income → Colorado starting point.

### Home office deduction

- **Home office deduction flow-through** — Federal home office deduction flows through Schedule C → federal AGI → federal taxable income → Colorado.

### Estimated tax payments (Form DR 0104EP)

- **Threshold** — > $1,000 USD (Net tax after withholding and credits)  _(Form DR 0104EP)_
- **Safe harbor** — Pay the lesser of 70% of current year tax or 100% of prior year tax (110% for high-income).  _(Form DR 0104EP)_
- **Due dates** — April 15, June 15, September 15, January 15.  _(Form DR 0104EP)_
- **Payment methods** — Revenue Online (revenueonline.colorado.gov), credit/debit card, e-check, EFT, or mail Form DR 0104EP with check to Colorado Department of Revenue, Denver, CO 80261-0008.  _(Form DR 0104EP)_

## Section 5: Tier 1 rules — deterministic

| T1-03 | Social Security subtraction (age 55–64) | Partial subtraction available |
| T1-04 | Social Security subtraction (age 65+) | Full subtraction of benefits included in federal taxable income |

| T1-06 | U.S. government interest subtraction | Subtract interest on U.S. obligations included in federal taxable income |
| T1-07 | State refund addition | Add back state tax refund if itemized in prior year |

| # | Rule | Why judgment needed |
