## Section 2 — Fund accounting

| **Quasi-endowment** | Board-designated for long-term investment but not donor-restricted |

**[T1] UK Charities SORP** has parallel categories (unrestricted general funds; designated funds; restricted income funds; endowment funds — permanent and expendable).

## Section 4 — VAT / GST for charities

**[T1]** Charity VAT treatment is highly jurisdiction-specific:

| Country | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **UK** | Charity-specific zero-rated supplies (zero-rated charity sales of donated goods); reduced rate on fuel/power for charity buildings; relief on capital goods for charity buildings |
| **EU** | Article 132 PVD: exempt activities including health, education, social, cultural, sport, religious — but exemption is mandatory for the activity, not optional, and may not align with the charity's profitable activities |
| **US** | n/a (sales/use tax state-level; many states exempt nonprofit purchases) |
| **Australia** | GST-free supplies for charity (e.g., gifts received, donated goods sold) |

---

## Section 5 — Self-dealing and minimum distribution (US private foundations)

**[T1] IRC §4941 — Self-dealing**: a per-se prohibition on most transactions between the foundation and "disqualified persons" (substantial contributors, foundation managers, families). 10% excise on disqualified person + 5% on manager.

**[T1] IRC §4942 — Minimum distribution**: 5% of average net investment assets must be distributed annually for qualifying charitable purposes; 30% excise tax on undistributed amount.

---

## Section 6 — Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)

**[T1]** A donor-advised fund is a charitable account held at a sponsoring organisation. Donor receives immediate tax deduction; gets non-binding advisory right over investment and distribution.

US §4966 — distributions from a DAF to certain disqualified persons or to non-public-charity grantees attract excise tax.

UK has limited DAF equivalents through Charities Aid Foundation and others.

## Section 7 — Cross-border philanthropy

**[T1]** Cross-border charitable giving faces:
- US: deduction generally only for §170(c) US charity; foreign equivalent only via "friends of" intermediary or §4945 expenditure responsibility
