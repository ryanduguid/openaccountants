## Section 1 — Revenue recognition (IFRS 15 / ASC 606)

### 1.1 Five-step model

**[T1]**
1. Identify the contract with a customer
2. Identify the performance obligations
3. Determine the transaction price
4. Allocate the price to the performance obligations
5. Recognise revenue when each performance obligation is satisfied

### 1.2 Key SaaS issues

| Topic | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Subscription / SaaS access** | Generally one performance obligation, satisfied over time (stand-ready obligation) — straight-line revenue over the term |
| **Implementation services** | Distinct (separate PO) only if customer can benefit from the SaaS without them; otherwise combined and recognised over the SaaS term |
| **Right of use license vs hosted service** | If the customer has a right to use the underlying software (e.g., download), revenue at point in time; if hosted, recognise over the contract term (stand-ready) |
| **Setup fees / activation fees** | Combine with subscription if not distinct; recognise over the customer's expected life |
| **Discounts and ramps** | Allocate to all POs proportionately, not just to specific period |
| **Variable consideration** | Constrain to amount unlikely to require significant reversal; commonly estimated for usage-based |
| **Customer acquisition costs (commissions)** | Capitalise per IFRS 15 ¶91-94 / ASC 340-40; amortise over expected customer life (often longer than contract term) |
| **Hosting agreement under SaaS arrangement (customer-side accounting)** | Cloud Computing Arrangement (CCA) — generally expensed as incurred; ASU 2018-15 allows capitalisation of certain implementation costs aligned to ASC 350-40 |

### 1.3 Examples of common SaaS issues

**[T1] Multi-year contract with discount in year 1:**
Contract: 3 years; $100k year 1, $150k years 2 and 3. Total $400k.
- Straight-line allocation: $133k/yr recognised
- Year 1 deferred revenue $33k; recognised in years 2/3

**[T1] SaaS + implementation services:**
- If implementation specific to SaaS and customer can't benefit without it → one PO, recognise both over SaaS contract term
- If implementation could be sold separately and customer can use other vendors → separate POs, implementation recognised on completion

## Section 2 — US state sales tax on SaaS (post-Wayfair)

**[T1] South Dakota v. Wayfair (2018)** overturned the physical presence test for sales tax nexus. Economic nexus now applies — typically $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions to the state.

### 2.1 SaaS taxability by state (sample)

| State | SaaS taxable? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **California** | No (generally) — service not tangible personal property | But certain "canned software" downloads taxable |
| **New York** | Yes — sales tax on SaaS to NY customers since 2010 |
| **Texas** | Yes — "data processing service" since 1980s; 20% exemption under §151.351 |
| **Florida** | No — service, not tangible | |
| **Washington** | Yes — Retail Sales Tax + B&O Tax | |
| **Illinois** | Generally no for SaaS but specific products taxable | |
| **Pennsylvania** | Yes — Sales and Use Tax on "computer services" | |
| **Massachusetts** | Yes if "prewritten" but no if customer-specific | |
| **Ohio** | Yes if "electronic information services" | |
| **Virginia** | No — service | |
| **Tennessee** | Yes — Telecommunication Sales Tax also applies | |
| **Georgia** | No — service | |
| **North Carolina** | Yes — "digital codes" but SaaS itself contested | |

**[T1] Marketplace facilitator laws** — most states require marketplaces (Amazon, Etsy, etc.) to collect on behalf of sellers above thresholds.

## Section 3 — EU VAT for digital services

### 3.1 Place of supply

**[T1] Article 58 PVD:**
- B2C electronic services: place of supply is **where the customer is established / has permanent address / usually resides**
- B2B electronic services: place of supply is **where the customer is established** (reverse charge)

### 3.2 OSS (One-Stop-Shop) and IOSS (Import OSS)

**[T1]**
- **Union OSS**: EU established supplier registers in home MS, declares all B2C cross-border EU sales of services + intra-EU B2C distance sales of goods
- **Non-Union OSS**: non-EU supplier registers in chosen MS for B2C EU electronic services
- **IOSS**: import OSS for goods ≤ EUR 150 imported into EU

### 3.3 VAT rates by country

Country-specific. For digital services to consumers, the destination MS rate applies. See country VAT skills.

---

## Section 4 — Other major SaaS VAT/GST regimes

### 4.1 United Kingdom

**[T1]** Post-Brexit, UK applies own VAT regime:
- Same place-of-supply rules as EU but UK-specific
- VAT on Electronic Services (VOES) registration for non-UK suppliers
- Standard rate 20%

### 4.2 Australia — GST low-value imported services

**[T1]** Since 1 July 2017 (digital services) and 1 July 2018 (goods ≤ AUD 1,000):
- Non-resident suppliers must register and collect 10% GST on supplies to Australian consumers if turnover ≥ AUD 75k
- B2B reverse charge

### 4.3 Canada — GST/HST on digital products

**[T1]** Since 1 July 2021:
- Non-resident suppliers register and collect GST/HST on B2C digital services if Canadian sales ≥ CAD 30k
- Provincial PST/RST/QST may also apply (BC, MB, QC)

### 4.4 India — OIDAR + Equalisation Levy

**[T1]**
- **OIDAR (Online Information Database Access or Retrieval)** services to Indian consumers — non-resident supplier registers and collects GST (18%)
- **Equalisation Levy 2.0 — 6% on advertising income** (the 2% e-commerce levy was repealed 1 August 2024)

### 4.5 Other notable

- **New Zealand** — 15% GST on remote digital services from non-residents (since 2016)
- **Singapore** — 9% GST on B2C digital services from non-residents (raised from 7% in 2024)
- **Japan** — 10% consumption tax on B2C digital services
- **South Korea** — 10% VAT on B2C digital services
- **Mexico** — 16% VAT on digital services from non-residents (since 2020)
- **Chile** — 19% VAT on digital services
- **Argentina** — 21% VAT plus 8% withholding on digital services

## Section 5 — Permanent establishment risk for SaaS

**[T1]** OECD Model Article 5 — physical presence threshold. Pure SaaS without local server typically does not create PE. Risk areas:
- Dependent agents soliciting business
- Customer success / support staff in country
- Co-located servers (Article 5 commentary: server can be a PE if customised, owned, and CIGAs performed there)
- Marketing / sales offices

**[T1] BEPS Action 1 / digital PE**: OECD Pillar One Amount A would create a new taxing right for "market jurisdictions" — pending ratification. DSTs continue in 25+ countries (see `digital-services-tax-matrix.md`).

---

## Section 6 — IFRS 15 / ASC 606 acquisition cost capitalisation

**[T1]** Sales commissions paid on customer acquisition:
- Capitalise if incremental and recoverable (IFRS 15 ¶91-94 / ASC 340-40)
- Amortise over the **expected customer life** (often longer than initial contract — including expected renewals)
- Practical expedient: expense if amortisation period < 1 year

This typically generates a significant balance sheet asset for high-growth SaaS companies.

---

## Section 7 — SaaS-specific KPIs interaction with accounting

**[T1] Non-GAAP / management measures:**

| Metric | Definition | Accounting interaction |
|---|---|---|
| **MRR / ARR** | Monthly / annual recurring revenue | Often gross; differs from GAAP revenue (which is subscription net of discounts, recognised over time) |
| **Bookings** | New contract value signed | Pre-recognition |
| **Deferred revenue** | Cash received before service delivered | Balance sheet liability under ASC 606 / IFRS 15 |
| **RPO (Remaining Performance Obligations)** | Contractually committed future revenue | ASC 606 ¶54 / IFRS 15 ¶120 disclosure |
| **Customer churn / NRR (Net Revenue Retention)** | Customer departures and expansions | Drives expected customer life for commission amortisation |
| **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** | Total sales+marketing ÷ new customers | Forms basis of LTV/CAC ratio |
| **LTV (Lifetime Value)** | Gross margin × expected customer life | Critical for impairment testing |
