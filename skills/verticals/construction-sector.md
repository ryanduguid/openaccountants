## Section 1 — Revenue recognition for long-term contracts

### 1.1 IFRS 15 / ASC 606

**[T1] Performance obligation satisfied over time** if any of:
- Customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits (typically for routine services)
- Work creates or enhances an asset the customer controls
- No alternative use to seller + enforceable right to payment for work performed to date

**[T1] Input method** (proportion of costs incurred to total expected costs) — most common for construction.
**Output method** (units produced / milestones / surveys) — used where measurable units.

**[T1] Uninstalled materials** — exclude from cost-to-cost calculation to avoid overstating progress (IFRS 15 IE19 example).

### 1.2 US tax — long-term contracts (IRC §460)

**[T1]** A "long-term contract" is one not completed within the tax year started.

**[T1] Percentage of Completion Method (PCM)** — required for most contracts; based on cost-to-cost.

**[T1] Small Contractor Exception** — exempt from PCM if:
- Average annual gross receipts ≤ USD 30m (2025; indexed)
- Contract estimated to complete within 2 years

Small contractor may use Completed Contract Method (CCM) or Cash method for short-duration contracts.

**[T1] Home Construction Contract Exception** — residential construction not required to use PCM.

### 1.3 Look-back interest (US)

**[T1] §460(b)(2)**: at completion of long-term contract, recompute PCM based on actual rather than estimated costs; if difference creates over- or under-payment, interest computed.

---

## Section 2 — UK Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)

**[T1]** A withholding regime for payments by contractors to subcontractors in construction operations.

### 2.1 Contractor obligations

- Verify subcontractor with HMRC
- Withhold and remit to HMRC based on subcontractor status:
  - **Gross payment status** — 0% deduction
  - **Registered subcontractor** — 20% deduction
  - **Unregistered subcontractor** — 30% deduction
- Monthly CIS return (CIS300) by 19th of month
- Payment of CIS deducted by 22nd (electronic) / 19th (cheque)

### 2.2 Subcontractor

- Register as contractor (if employs other subbies)
- Apply for gross payment status if turnover ≥ GBP 30k per individual / GBP 30k per partner / GBP 200k per company
- Recover CIS deductions against own tax liability

### 2.3 Scope

**[T1]** "Construction operations" include site preparation, demolition, installation, building, painting/decorating, alteration. Excludes architecture, engineering, surveying.

**[T1] Mixed contracts** — full CIS applies unless the construction element is incidental and minor.

---

## Section 3 — UK Domestic Reverse Charge for Construction VAT

**[T1] Effective 1 March 2021** — domestic reverse charge applies to most construction services in the UK construction supply chain (subject to certain exceptions for end-user / intermediary supplier).

### 3.1 Mechanics

- Supplier issues invoice **without VAT** (notation: "reverse charge applies; customer pays VAT directly")
- Customer accounts for output VAT on their return AND recovers as input VAT (subject to standard rules)
- Net cash effect: nil for customer
- Disadvantages: smaller supplier cash flow worsens (no VAT on receipts)

### 3.2 Scope

**[T1]** Same as CIS for "construction services" between VAT-registered parties — supplier must charge reverse charge to other contractors. Excludes:
- Supplies to "end-users" (the final customer in the chain — typically the developer or building owner)
- Supplies to "intermediary suppliers" (those who acquire and on-supply construction services to end-users)

### 3.3 End-user / intermediary supplier notification

End-user / intermediary must notify supplier in writing; failure to notify means supplier should charge VAT normally.

## Section 4 — Construction VAT

### 4.1 New-build residential

**[T1]**
- **UK**: Zero-rated (Item 2(a) Group 5 Schedule 8 VATA)
- **France**: Reduced rate 5.5% for social housing (HLM); 10% for certain renovations
- **Germany**: Standard 19% on most; some construction services in residential sector exempt
- **Italy**: 4% on first-home purchase; 10% on non-first-home new build
- **Spain**: Reduced 10% on new residential

### 4.2 Renovation

**[T1]**
- **UK**: Reduced rate 5% for certain residential renovation (over-2-years empty; energy-saving materials)
- **EU**: Reduced rates per Annex III PVD allowed

### 4.3 Land

**[T1]** Most jurisdictions exempt sale of unimproved land. UK option to tax permitted for commercial land.

---

## Section 5 — Retention and progress billing

### 5.1 Retention

**[T1]** Construction contracts typically retain 5-10% of each progress payment for defects liability period. Accounting:
- Contract asset (under IFRS 15 / ASC 606) for amount earned but not billed
- Retention receivable recognised when retention released
- Bad debt provision for retention if collection uncertain

### 5.2 Progress billing

**[T1]**
- Issue progress invoice based on completion
- Recognise revenue on % completion (not invoice timing)
- Variance between billed amount and earned revenue → contract asset (earned > billed) or contract liability (billed > earned)

---

## Section 6 — Subcontractor classification

**[T1] Employment vs self-employed status** — material in construction:
- US: §530 relief; misclassification penalties; specific Department of Labor (Davis-Bacon) prevailing wage requirements on federal contracts
- UK: IR35 test for personal service companies; off-payroll worker rules
- Many jurisdictions: "deemed employment" tests for construction subcontractors
