# Construction Sector

## What this file is

A sector overlay for construction contractors, subcontractors, developers, and design-build firms.

## Section 1 — Revenue recognition for long-term contracts

### 1.1 IFRS 15 / ASC 606

- **Performance obligation satisfied over time** — if any of: Customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits (typically for routine services); Work creates or enhances an asset the customer controls; No alternative use to seller + enforceable right to payment for work performed to date  _([T1])_
- **Input method** — proportion of costs incurred to total expected costs — most common for construction.  _([T1])_
- **Output method** — units produced / milestones / surveys — used where measurable units.
- **Uninstalled materials** — exclude from cost-to-cost calculation to avoid overstating progress (IFRS 15 IE19 example).  _([T1])_

### 1.2 US tax — long-term contracts (IRC §460)

- **Long-term contract** — one not completed within the tax year started.  _([T1] IRC §460)_
- **Percentage of Completion Method (PCM)** — required for most contracts; based on cost-to-cost.  _([T1])_
- **Small Contractor Exception** — exempt from PCM if: Average annual gross receipts ≤ USD 30m (2025; indexed); Contract estimated to complete within 2 years  _([T1])_

Small contractor may use Completed Contract Method (CCM) or Cash method for short-duration contracts.

- **Home Construction Contract Exception** — residential construction not required to use PCM.  _([T1])_

### 1.3 Look-back interest (US)

- **§460(b)(2) look-back interest** — at completion of long-term contract, recompute PCM based on actual rather than estimated costs; if difference creates over- or under-payment, interest computed.  _([T1] §460(b)(2))_

## Section 2 — UK Construction Industry Scheme (CIS)

- **CIS overview** — A withholding regime for payments by contractors to subcontractors in construction operations.  _([T1])_

### 2.1 Contractor obligations

- **Verify subcontractor with HMRC** — Contractor must verify subcontractor with HMRC
- **Gross payment status deduction** — 0% percent
- **Registered subcontractor deduction** — 20% percent
- **Unregistered subcontractor deduction** — 30% percent
- **Monthly CIS return (CIS300)** — by 19th of month
- **Payment of CIS deducted** — by 22nd (electronic) / 19th (cheque)

### 2.2 Subcontractor

- **Register as contractor** — if employs other subbies
- **Gross payment status turnover threshold** — GBP 30k per individual / GBP 30k per partner / GBP 200k per company GBP
- **Recover CIS deductions** — Recover CIS deductions against own tax liability

### 2.3 Scope

- **Construction operations** — include site preparation, demolition, installation, building, painting/decorating, alteration. Excludes architecture, engineering, surveying.  _([T1])_
- **Mixed contracts** — full CIS applies unless the construction element is incidental and minor.  _([T1])_

## Section 3 — UK Domestic Reverse Charge for Construction VAT

- **Effective date and applicability** — Effective 1 March 2021 — domestic reverse charge applies to most construction services in the UK construction supply chain (subject to certain exceptions for end-user / intermediary supplier).  _([T1])_

### 3.1 Mechanics

- **Invoice notation** — Supplier issues invoice without VAT (notation: "reverse charge applies; customer pays VAT directly")
- **Customer VAT accounting** — Customer accounts for output VAT on their return AND recovers as input VAT (subject to standard rules)
- **Net cash effect** — nil for customer
- **Disadvantages** — smaller supplier cash flow worsens (no VAT on receipts)

### 3.2 Scope

- **Reverse charge scope** — Same as CIS for "construction services" between VAT-registered parties — supplier must charge reverse charge to other contractors. Excludes: Supplies to "end-users" (the final customer in the chain — typically the developer or building owner); Supplies to "intermediary suppliers" (those who acquire and on-supply construction services to end-users)  _([T1])_

### 3.3 End-user / intermediary supplier notification

- **Notification requirement** — End-user / intermediary must notify supplier in writing; failure to notify means supplier should charge VAT normally.

## Section 4 — Construction VAT

### 4.1 New-build residential

- **UK** — Zero-rated (Item 2(a) Group 5 Schedule 8 VATA)  _([T1] Item 2(a) Group 5 Schedule 8 VATA)_
- **France new-build residential VAT** — Reduced rate 5.5% for social housing (HLM); 10% for certain renovations  _([T1])_
- **Germany new-build residential VAT** — Standard 19% on most; some construction services in residential sector exempt  _([T1])_
- **Italy new-build residential VAT** — 4% on first-home purchase; 10% on non-first-home new build  _([T1])_
- **Spain new-build residential VAT** — Reduced 10% on new residential  _([T1])_

### 4.2 Renovation

- **UK renovation VAT** — Reduced rate 5% for certain residential renovation (over-2-years empty; energy-saving materials)  _([T1])_
- **EU renovation VAT** — Reduced rates per Annex III PVD allowed  _([T1])_

### 4.3 Land

- **Land VAT treatment** — Most jurisdictions exempt sale of unimproved land. UK option to tax permitted for commercial land.  _([T1])_

### 5.1 Retention

- **Retention practice and accounting** — Construction contracts typically retain 5-10% of each progress payment for defects liability period. Accounting: Contract asset (under IFRS 15 / ASC 606) for amount earned but not billed; Retention receivable recognised when retention released; Bad debt provision for retention if collection uncertain  _([T1])_

### 5.2 Progress billing

- **Progress billing treatment** — Issue progress invoice based on completion; Recognise revenue on % completion (not invoice timing); Variance between billed amount and earned revenue → contract asset (earned > billed) or contract liability (billed > earned)  _([T1])_

## Section 6 — Subcontractor classification

- **Employment vs self-employed status** — material in construction: US: §530 relief; misclassification penalties; specific Department of Labor (Davis-Bacon) prevailing wage requirements on federal contracts; UK: IR35 test for personal service companies; off-payroll worker rules; Many jurisdictions: "deemed employment" tests for construction subcontractors  _([T1])_
