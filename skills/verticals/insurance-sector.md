## Section 2 — IFRS 17 ↔ ASC 944 LDTI differences

**[T1] See `ifrs-local-gaap-reconciliation.md` for foundation. Insurance-specific:**

| Topic | IFRS 17 | ASC 944 LDTI |
|---|---|---|
| Liability measurement | Building Block Approach (BBA), Premium Allocation Approach (PAA) for short-duration, Variable Fee Approach (VFA) for direct participating | Net premium reserve; updated assumptions through P&L (LDTI improvements) |
| Discount rate | Top-down or bottom-up; reflects characteristics of cash flows | Single A-quality corporate yield curve (LDTI prescribed) |
| Contractual Service Margin (CSM) | Recognised in P&L over coverage period | No equivalent — gain at issue spread differently |
| Risk Adjustment | Reflects compensation for non-financial risk; entity-specific | Different — discretion in net premium reserve methodology |
| Onerous contract | Loss recognised immediately + Loss Component tracking | Premium Deficiency Reserve (PDR) at portfolio level |
| Reinsurance held | Asset/liability separately; expected to mirror underlying when treaty matches | Recognised as reduction of net premium |

**[T1] Material tax interaction:** IFRS 17 CSM creates a deferred tax balance — the CSM is recognised in equity at transition but released to P&L over time. Deferred tax tracks this release.

## Section 4 — Captive insurance

**[T1] Common captive jurisdictions:**

|---|---|---|
