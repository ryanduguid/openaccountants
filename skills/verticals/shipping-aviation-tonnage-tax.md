## Section 1 — Tonnage tax regimes

**[T1] Tonnage tax** is a presumptive tax based on a vessel's net tonnage, replacing regular corporate income tax on qualifying shipping activities. EU regimes operate under the **Community Guidelines on State Aid to Maritime Transport** (2004, updated 2024).

### Key EU regimes

| **Greece** | Article 75 Constitution-protected; rates set per vessel type | Greek flag (extensive Greek-flagged fleet) | World's largest tonnage tax regime; 80% of Greek-owned vessels under Greek flag |
| **Cyprus** | EUR rates per 100 net tonnes per day, banded by size | EU/EEA strategic management in Cyprus | Available for ship owners, ship managers, charterers |
| **Malta** | EUR rates per 100 net tonnes; banded | EU/EEA flag; commercial management in Malta | Includes ship management; recent state aid extension |
| **United Kingdom** | Daily profit per 100 net tonnes (bands 0.6, 0.45, 0.30 GBP) | UK / EU / EEA flag minimum 60% of qualifying group | FA 2000 Sch 22; reformed 2024 to permit non-UK flag in some cases |

| **France** | EUR per 100 net tonnes per day | EU/EEA flag | Tonnage tax regime CGI Art. 209-0 B |
| **Italy** | EUR per ton banded; tonnage tax option | EU/EEA flag | Articolo 156 TUIR |

| **South Korea** | Tonnage tax option |
| **India** | Tonnage tax option since 2004 (Income Tax Act Chapter XII-G) |
| **Japan** | Tonnage tax option since 2008 — limited adoption |

## Section 2 — Eligibility tests

**[T1] Standard tests across regimes:**

1. **Vessel type** — typically excludes fishing vessels, dredgers (some included), ferries below threshold, leisure
2. **Strategic and commercial management** — must be carried out in the regime jurisdiction (EU State Aid guidelines)
3. **Flag minimum** — vessels under EU/EEA flag must constitute a minimum % of the qualifying fleet (typically 60% for fleet extensions; relief if increasing tonnage)
4. **Activity scope** — international transport (some regimes include cabotage)
5. **Lock-in** — 10-year minimum tenure in tonnage tax regime; exit penalty for early withdrawal

## Section 3 — Aviation lessor regimes

### 3.1 Ireland — global aircraft leasing hub

**[T1]**
- Standard 12.5% trading rate applicable to leasing activity if commercial substance
- **Section 110 SPV** (TCA 1997 s.110): securitisation vehicle for aircraft lease finance; effectively neutral CIT but profit-extraction via interest
- **8% accelerated depreciation** on aircraft (TCA s.284) until disposal
- **Lessor activity is a trade** for CIT and treaty purposes
- **Pillar Two QDMTT** in force from 2024 — affects in-scope groups

### 3.2 Singapore — Aircraft Leasing Scheme

**[T1]**
- ALS reduced rate (~8%) on qualifying aircraft leasing income; ALSI for aircraft investment manager
- Maritime Sector Incentive equivalent in scope and benefit

### 3.3 Hong Kong — Aircraft Leasing Incentive

**[T1]**
- 8.25% concessionary rate on qualifying aircraft leasing
- 50% gross income basis for asset depreciation

### 3.4 Bermuda

**[T1]**
- Aircraft Securitisation; flagging of aircraft via Cape Town Convention
- New 15% CIT from 2025 for in-scope MNE groups

---

## Section 4 — Cape Town Convention

**[T1]** The Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Cape Town, 2001) + Aircraft Protocol provides a unified framework for security interests in aircraft. Most major aviation finance jurisdictions are signatories. Affects creditor priority in lessee insolvency, not tax directly, but interacts with sale-leaseback structures.

---

## Section 5 — IFRS 16 Lessor (aircraft and ships)

**[T1]** Lessor accounting under IFRS 16 substantially preserved IAS 17 — finance lease vs operating lease distinction at lessor. Most aircraft / vessel leases are operating leases for lessor, with rental income recognised straight-line.

US GAAP ASC 842: substantially same lessor model.

## Section 6 — Self-checks

- [ ] Tonnage tax regime entry conditions met (vessel type, strategic management, flag minimum)
- [ ] Qualifying vs non-qualifying activities separated (only qualifying gets tonnage; rest at regular CIT)
- [ ] 10-year regime tenure tracked
- [ ] EU State Aid Guidelines compliance (where applicable)
- [ ] Ship management vs ship owner status distinct (each may have own regime)
- [ ] Aircraft lessor activity meets commercial substance for treaty access
- [ ] Section 110 SPV substance documented (Irish lessors)
- [ ] Pillar Two ETR analysis — tonnage tax presumptive amounts produce ETRs well below 15%; top-up tax exposure
- [ ] Cape Town Convention security interest considered for finance lease structuring
- [ ] Output flags every [T2]/[T3] item for reviewer judgement
