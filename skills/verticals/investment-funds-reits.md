## What this file is

A sector overlay for investment funds and REITs covering fund-level, GP-level, and investor-level taxation.

---

## Section 1 — Fund taxation principles

**[T1] Two foundational models:**

| Model | Fund-level tax | Investor-level tax |
|---|---|---|
| **Tax-transparent** | None (the fund "looks through" to investors) | Investor taxed on its share of fund income as if directly held |
| **Tax-opaque (blocker)** | Fund pays CIT (usually with offset for distributions) | Investor taxed only on distributions / dispositions |

**[T1] Special "fiscally transparent for tax / opaque for legal" structures:**
- US LP / LLC
- UK Partnership
- Cayman Exempted LP
- Luxembourg RAIF as SIF / SCSp (partnership)
- Irish ILP (Investment Limited Partnership)

---

## Section 2 — UCITS and AIF (EU)

### 2.1 UCITS

**[T1]** UCITS funds (Undertaking for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) under Directive 2009/65/EC are usually structured as:
- **Investment company with variable capital** (SICAV in Luxembourg, ICAV in Ireland)
- **Common contractual fund** (FCP in Luxembourg / France)
- **Unit trust** (UK)

**[T1] Fund-level tax:**
- **Luxembourg**: subscription tax (taxe d'abonnement) — 0.05% / 0.01% (annual on NAV); no CIT on UCITS profits
- **Ireland**: ICAV / UCITS exempt CIT under TCA s.739D — Investment Undertaking Tax (IUT) only on Irish resident investors
- **France**: FCP transparent; SICAV with specific regime
- **UK**: Authorised funds with specific UK fund tax regime

### 2.2 AIF (Alternative Investment Fund)

**[T1]** AIFs under AIFMD (Directive 2011/61/EU) have wider product range:
- Hedge funds
- Private equity funds
- Real estate funds
- Infrastructure funds
- Hybrid funds

Tax treatment depends on legal form and jurisdiction; typically tax-transparent or low-tax-blocker.

### 2.3 Specific Luxembourg vehicles

| Vehicle | Tax |
|---|---|
| **SIF (Specialised Investment Fund)** | Subscription tax 0.01% NAV; no CIT (Lux Law 13 February 2007) |
| **RAIF (Reserved Alternative Investment Fund)** | Choice of SIF-style or SICAR-style; flexible (Law 23 July 2016) |
| **SICAR (Société d'Investissement en Capital à Risque)** | Subscription tax-exempt; CIT but with extensive participation exemption; capital risk |
| **SCSp (Special Limited Partnership)** | Tax-transparent (partnership) (Law 12 July 2013) |

---

## Section 3 — Carried interest tax

**[T1] By jurisdiction:**

| Country | Treatment | Effective rate |
|---|---|---|
| **United States** | §1061 ITA: carried interest classified as long-term capital gain only if 3-year holding period (raised from 1 year by TCJA 2017); otherwise short-term ordinary | ~20% LTCG vs 37% short-term/ordinary |
| **United Kingdom** | Carried Interest from April 2025: 32% effective rate (reformed from CGT-only treatment); Disguised Investment Management Fees (DIMF) since 2015 | 32% (proposed from April 2025; consultation ongoing) |
| **France** | Carried interest treated as employment income (and capital gain on disposal) for managers; specific holding period requirement | Effective marginal rate close to top income tax |
| **Italy** | Carried interest classified as investment income if specific conditions met (commitment / employment) | 26% capital gain rate possible |
| **Germany** | 60% of carried interest treated as employment income (Halbeinkünfteverfahren) — favourable | Reduced rate |
| **Spain** | New 2025 rules characterise carried interest as employment income absent specific conditions | Up to ~50% |

---

## Section 4 — PFIC mechanics (US investors)

**[T1] §1297 ITA — Passive Foreign Investment Company:**

A foreign corporation is a PFIC if:
- ≥75% of gross income is passive (income test), OR
- ≥50% of average assets produce passive income (asset test)

**[T1] Tax consequences without election:**
- Excess distributions and dispositions taxed at maximum ordinary rate for prior years held
- Interest charge for deemed deferral

**[T1] QEF (Qualified Electing Fund) election:**
- US investor includes pro-rata share of fund's ordinary earnings and net capital gain annually
- Annual PFIC Annual Information Statement required from fund
- Avoids excess distribution / interest charge regime

**[T1] MTM (Mark-to-Market) election:**
- Annual gain/loss recognised on PFIC shares treated as ordinary income
- Available for "marketable" PFIC shares

**[T1] PFIC exception — Active insurance corporation** under §1297(f) — see `insurance-sector.md`.
