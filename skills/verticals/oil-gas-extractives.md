## Section 1 — Fiscal regimes overview

**[T1] Three main regime models:**

| Regime | Mechanism | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Concession / Royalty + Tax** | Operator pays royalty + standard CIT (often ring-fenced) | UK (Brent, North Sea), Norway, US (federal + state royalty + CIT), Canada, Australia |
| **Production Sharing Contract (PSC)** | Operator recovers costs from "cost oil/gas"; "profit oil/gas" split with government per scale | Indonesia, Nigeria, Angola, Egypt, Algeria, Brazil pre-salt, Kazakhstan |
| **Service / Risk Service** | Operator paid fee per unit produced; government retains ownership | Mexico (pre-2014 reform), Iran (buyback), Iraq (technical services contract) |

---

## Section 2 — UK North Sea fiscal regime

### 2.1 The ring-fence

**[T1]** UK upstream petroleum activities are "ring-fenced" — losses and profits from non-ring-fence trades cannot offset ring-fence profits.

### 2.2 Three taxes

**[T1]**
- **Ring-Fence Corporation Tax (RFCT)** — 30% (Finance Act 2002)
- **Supplementary Charge (SC)** — 10% additional tax (reduced from 32% in 2016, reinstated to 10% in 2024)
- **Energy Profits Levy (EPL)** — 35% (Energy Profits Levy Act 2022; rate increased to 38% from 1 November 2024 under Finance Act 2025 amendments; sunset extended to March 2030)
- **Total effective rate**: 30% + 10% + 38% = **78%** (post-November 2024)
- **Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT)** — frozen at 0% from 2016 for new fields

### 2.3 Allowances

- Capital allowances (100% first-year on most plant and machinery in ring-fence)
- Loss carryforward / carryback intricate
- EPL investment allowance (44% — reduced from 80%) for qualifying ring-fence investment expenditure

---

## Section 3 — Norwegian Special Tax

**[T1]**
- **Standard CIT**: 22%
- **Special petroleum tax (SPT)**: 56% (effective rate)
- Combined marginal rate: 78%
- Recently introduced cash-flow basis for tax reform: full first-year deduction of qualifying upstream investment (reformed 2022); SPT calculated on operating cash flow less qualified investment expense

---

## Section 4 — EU Solidarity Contribution

**[T1] Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854** (October 2022):
- Temporary solidarity contribution on fossil fuel sector "surplus profits"
- 33% surcharge on profits above 120% of 4-year average
- Member States implemented as temporary windfall taxes for 2022 and 2023
- Most Member States extended through 2024-2025; UK has its own EPL outside EU framework

---

## Section 5 — US oil and gas

**[T1]**
- **Federal CIT**: 21%
- **State CIT**: variable
- **Severance taxes**: state-level on extracted product (Texas oil severance 4.6%; Oklahoma 7%; ND 6.5%; WV 5%; etc.)
- **Royalty**: federal lease 18.75% offshore / 12.5% onshore (raised from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022 reform); state and private lease rates negotiated
- **IDC (Intangible Drilling Costs)** — election to expense currently (§263(c))
- **Depletion allowance** — percentage depletion for small producers (§613A) or cost depletion (§612)
- **Successful Efforts vs Full Cost** — financial accounting method choice (ASC 932)

---

## Section 6 — Mining sector

### 6.1 Major mining jurisdictions

| Country | Royalty | CIT | Notable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Australia** | Mineral Resources Rent Tax (MRRT) repealed 2014; state royalties (NSW, QLD, WA variable 2-10%) | 30% CIT; full expensing of capital | Major iron ore, coal, gold |
| **Canada** | Provincial royalty + CIT 26.5% combined | Federal 15% + provincial | Major potash, oil sands |
| **Chile** | Mining royalty (2024 reform: ad-valorem + margin-based 1-2% + 10-32% on profits above thresholds) | 25% CIT | World's largest copper |
| **Peru** | Mining royalty 1-12% by margin; Special Mining Tax 2-8.4% on operating margin; CIT 29.5% | 29.5% | Major copper, gold, zinc |
| **South Africa** | Mining royalty 0.5-7% by refined vs unrefined | 27% CIT (post-2024) | Major platinum, gold |
| **Indonesia** | Royalty 3-6% by mineral; PSC for oil/gas | 22% CIT | Major coal, nickel |

### 6.2 EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative)

**[T1]** 50+ implementing countries publish reconciled extractive payments and receipts. EU Accounting and Transparency Directives require listed extractive companies to publish payments to governments (Country-by-Country Reporting equivalent).

---

## Section 7 — Accounting issues

### 7.1 Successful Efforts vs Full Cost

**[T1] Successful Efforts** — only successful exploration costs capitalised; dry holes expensed.
**Full Cost** — all exploration and development costs capitalised in "cost pool" by country.

US GAAP ASC 932 permits both. IFRS 6 (Exploration and Evaluation Assets) allows choice for E&E phase but development phase aligned to IAS 16 / IAS 38.

### 7.2 Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) / Decommissioning

**[T1]** IAS 37 / ASC 410: provision for future decommissioning recognised at discounted PV of cost when constructive obligation arises (typically at first production).
- Provision debited as asset addition; depleted with the reserve
- Tax deduction generally only when actually incurred (jurisdiction-specific)
- Material deferred tax timing difference

### 7.3 Reserves estimation (PRMS)

**[T1]** Petroleum Resources Management System: 1P (proved), 2P (proved + probable), 3P (proved + probable + possible). Recoverable reserves drive depletion accounting.

## Section 8 — Pillar Two interaction

**[T1]** Extractives jurisdictions with low CIT but high royalty/severance face Pillar Two complexity:
- Royalty is typically treated as "Covered Tax" if levied on income (some jurisdictions classify as production tax, ambiguous)
- Severance taxes mostly NOT Covered Taxes
- Carve-out for "International Shipping Income" exists; no equivalent for extractives
- Substance-Based Income Exclusion (SBIE) particularly material for capital-intensive extractives
