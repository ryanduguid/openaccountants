| Unknown holding period for shares | Short-term (higher rate applies to gains) |
| Unknown source country of dividend | Domestic (no treaty relief assumed) |
| Unknown franking percentage | Unfranked (no credit) |
| Unknown whether interest is tax-free (e.g., ISA/Roth) | Taxable |
| Unknown cost basis of securities sold | Zero (maximum gain) |

---

## Step 0 — Onboarding questions

Before computing, you MUST obtain:

1. **Dividend income received** — amounts, payer companies, dates of payment
2. **Dividend classification** — qualified/ordinary (US), franked/unfranked (AU), UK company vs foreign
3. **Interest income** — bank interest, bond interest, P2P lending, amounts and payers
4. **Capital gains on securities** — disposal proceeds, acquisition cost, dates (for holding period)
5. **Tax-advantaged accounts** — ISA/TFSA/Roth/super holdings (exempt income)
6. **Foreign investment income** — country of source, withholding tax deducted at source
7. **Dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs)** — reinvested dividends are still taxable income
8. **Franking/imputation credits received** — for AU/NZ: franking credit statements
9. **Any tax treaties to consider?** — residency and source country combination
10. **Prior year capital losses carried forward?**

## Step 1 — Dividend classification and taxation

### Classification decision tree

```
Is the dividend from a domestic or foreign source?
  ├─ DOMESTIC
  │   ├─ Is there a dividend allowance? [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]
  │   │   ├─ YES → First [amount] is tax-free
  │   │   └─ NO → Fully taxable
  │   ├─ Franking/imputation system? [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]
  │   │   ├─ YES → Gross up dividend; apply franking credit (see Step 4)
  │   │   └─ NO → Tax at dividend rates
  │   └─ Rate: [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC dividend rate table]
  └─ FOREIGN
      ├─ Withholding tax deducted at source? → Claim DTR (see Step 7)
      ├─ Is it "qualified" (US)? → Lower rate if holding period met
      └─ Rate: [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC rate for foreign dividends]
```

### Dividend tax rate table

| Taxpayer's marginal band | Dividend rate | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|
| Basic / standard | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 8.75% UK, 0%/10%/15% US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Higher / middle | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 33.75% UK, 15% US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Additional / top | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 39.35% UK, 20% US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Qualified vs ordinary dividends (US-style classification)

| Type | Criteria | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Qualified | Holding period > 60 days within 121-day window; from US corp or qualified foreign corp | 0% / 15% / 20% per income bracket |
| Ordinary (non-qualified) | Holding period not met; or from non-qualified source | Marginal income tax rate (up to 37%) |
| Return of capital | Distribution exceeds earnings & profits | Reduces cost basis; not currently taxable |

---

## Step 2 — Withholding tax on dividends

### Domestic withholding

| Jurisdiction | Domestic WHT rate | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 0% UK, 0% US domestic, 20% ZA DWT] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., final tax ZA, credit US/UK] |

### Treaty withholding rates (common examples)

| Source country | Standard rate | Treaty rate (to [COUNTRY]) | Conditions |
|---|---|---|---|
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | Beneficial ownership; [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC minimum holding %] |
| US | 30% | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 15% to UK/AU/CA] | W-8BEN filed; beneficial owner |
| UK | 0% (no WHT on dividends) | 0% | N/A |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Forms for treaty relief

| Form | Purpose | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|
| W-8BEN | Claim reduced US WHT under treaty | US (non-resident alien) |
| W-8BEN-E | Same for entities | US |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC form] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

---

## Step 3 — Interest income

### Classification and taxation

| Type | Tax treatment | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Bank/building society interest | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — paid gross or net of withholding] | Marginal / [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Government bond interest (gilts/treasuries) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — exempt or taxable] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Corporate bond interest | Taxable as income | Marginal rate |
| P2P lending interest | Taxable as income | Marginal rate |
| Interest from tax-free accounts (ISA/TFSA/Roth) | Exempt | 0% |
| Foreign interest | Taxable; credit for foreign WHT | Marginal rate |

### Personal savings allowance (where applicable)

| Marginal rate band | Allowance | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|
| Basic rate taxpayer | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £1,000 UK] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Higher rate taxpayer | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £500 UK] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Additional rate taxpayer | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £0 UK] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Interest income computation

```
Gross interest received (or accrued, per accounting basis)
  LESS: Personal savings allowance [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]
  = Taxable interest income
  × Marginal income tax rate
  = Tax on interest
  LESS: Tax deducted at source (if any)
  = Net tax due / (refund)
```

---

## Step 4 — Franking / imputation credits

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: This section applies to AU, NZ, and other imputation systems. Delete for UK/US.]

### How imputation works

```
Cash dividend received                        $700
Franking credit (at company tax rate 30%)     $300
Grossed-up dividend (assessable income)       $1,000

Tax on grossed-up dividend at marginal rate:
  e.g., 32.5% × $1,000 = $325
LESS: Franking credit offset                  ($300)
= Net tax payable on dividend                 $25

If franking credit > tax liability → refund of excess (AU)
[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: NZ does not refund excess imputation credits to individuals]
```

### Franking credit formula

```
Franking credit = Cash dividend × (Company tax rate / (1 - Company tax rate))
e.g., $700 × (0.30 / 0.70) = $300
```

### Partially franked dividends

```
Total dividend = Franked portion + Unfranked portion
Franking credit applies only to franked portion
Unfranked portion taxed at marginal rate with no credit
```

---

## Step 5 — Capital gains on securities

### Computation per disposal

```
Disposal proceeds (sale price × quantity)
  LESS: Brokerage / commission on sale
  LESS: Cost basis (acquisition price × quantity)
  LESS: Brokerage / commission on purchase
  LESS: [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC indexation allowance, if applicable]
  = Capital gain / (loss)
```

### Holding period and rates

| Holding period | Classification | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| ≤ [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 12 months US/AU] | Short-term | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., marginal rate US, marginal AU] |
| > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 12 months US/AU] | Long-term | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 0/15/20% US, 50% discount AU] |

### CGT discount / inclusion rate

| Jurisdiction | Mechanism | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| US | Preferential rate (0/15/20%) | Lower rate for long-term gains |
| AU | 50% CGT discount (individuals) | Only 50% of gain is assessable |
| ZA | 40% inclusion rate (individuals) | Only 40% of gain is taxed at marginal rate |
| UK | Flat rates (10%/20% or 18%/24% for property) | Applied to net gain after AEA |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Cost basis methods for securities

| Method | Description | Jurisdictions |
|---|---|---|
| FIFO | First shares bought are first sold | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — default UK (S104 pool actually), AU] |
| Specific identification | Taxpayer designates which lot | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — US with broker confirmation] |
| Average cost | Pooled cost ÷ total shares = per-share cost | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — UK S104 pool, mutual fund US] |
| LIFO | Last bought first sold | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — rare; check availability] |

---

## Step 6 — Dividend allowance and tax-free amounts

| Jurisdiction | Allowance | Year | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| UK | £500 | 2024/25 | Reduced from £1,000 (2023/24) and £2,000 (2022/23) |
| US | $0 (no allowance) | N/A | All dividends taxable (unless in Roth/IRA) |
| ZA | R0 (dividends tax is final WHT at 20%) | N/A | No individual allowance; WHT is final |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Dividend allowance computation (UK example)

```
Total dividend income                          £5,000
LESS: Dividend allowance                       (£500)
= Taxable dividends                            £4,500

If basic rate band remaining ≥ £4,500:
  Tax = £4,500 × 8.75% = £393.75
If partially in higher band:
  Split between bands and apply respective rates
```

---

## Step 7 — Foreign dividends and double tax relief

### Computation of double tax relief (DTR)

```
Foreign dividend received (gross, before WHT)   [CURRENCY] X
Foreign WHT deducted at source                  [CURRENCY] Y
Net dividend received                           [CURRENCY] (X - Y)

Domestic tax on gross foreign dividend:
  X × [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC marginal rate] = Z

DTR credit = LOWER OF:
  (a) Foreign WHT actually paid (Y)
  (b) Domestic tax on that income (Z)

Net domestic tax = Z - DTR credit
```

### Excess foreign tax credit

| Jurisdiction | Treatment of excess |
|---|---|
| US | Carry back 1 year / forward 10 years |
| UK | Cannot carry; lost if exceeds UK tax |
| AU | Cannot carry; lost |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Foreign income reporting

| Aspect | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Conversion to local currency | Use exchange rate on date of payment (or average rate if [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] permits) |
| Gross-up for WHT | Report gross amount (before WHT) as income |
| Claim credit separately | DTR claimed on return [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC form/box] |
| Documentation | Dividend statements; WHT certificates; broker 1099-DIV (US) |

---

## Step 8 — Reporting requirements

### Annual return reporting

| Income type | Where reported | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|
| Dividends (domestic) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., SA100 Box 4 UK, 1040 Schedule B US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Dividends (foreign) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., SA106 UK, 1040 Schedule B US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Interest income | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., SA100 Box 2 UK, Schedule B US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Capital gains | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., SA108 UK, Schedule D US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Franking credits | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — AU supplementary section] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| DTR claims | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., SA106 UK, Form 1116 US] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Reporting thresholds

| Threshold | Jurisdiction | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| > $10 interest/dividends from single payer | US | 1099-INT / 1099-DIV issued |
| > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] total investment income | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | Must file return / supplementary pages |
| Foreign accounts > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., $10,000 US FBAR] | Additional disclosure required |

---

## Step 9 — Interaction with personal income tax

### Order of taxation (UK example structure)

```
1. Non-savings income (employment, self-employment, rental, pension)
   → Uses personal allowance and basic rate band first
2. Savings income (interest)
   → Savings allowance within remaining basic rate band
3. Dividend income (taxed last)
   → Dividend allowance then dividend rates on remainder

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Insert ordering rules for your jurisdiction]
```

### Impact on marginal rate

| Scenario | Effect on investment income taxation |
|---|---|
| High employment income pushes into higher band | Dividends/gains taxed at higher rates |
| Loss of personal allowance (income > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]) | Effective marginal rate increases |
| Dividend income pushes into next band | Marginal rate changes mid-dividend |
| Capital gains added on top | CGT rate determined by remaining basic rate band |

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER assume all dividends are qualified — holding period and source tests must be verified
- NEVER ignore withholding tax already deducted at source — it is a credit, not a loss
- NEVER double-count franking credits — the gross-up and credit must be applied symmetrically
- NEVER apply treaty rates without confirming beneficial ownership and correct forms filed
- NEVER treat dividend reinvestment (DRIP) as non-taxable — reinvested dividends are taxable income
- NEVER ignore the ordering rules — non-savings, savings, dividends use bands in sequence
- NEVER claim foreign tax credit exceeding domestic tax on that income
- NEVER apply CGT discount/inclusion without verifying holding period threshold
- NEVER mix pre-tax and post-tax dividend figures — always identify whether amounts are gross or net of WHT
- NEVER present outputs as tax advice — direct to a qualified tax professional

---

## Edge Case Registry

| # | Scenario | Correct treatment |
|---|---|---|
| EC-1 | Stock dividend (scrip dividend) instead of cash | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — generally taxable at market value of shares received] |
| EC-2 | Return of capital distribution (exceeds E&P) | Not income; reduces cost basis of shares; excess is capital gain |
| EC-3 | Dividend from REIT / property fund | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may be taxed as property income, not dividend] |
| EC-4 | Liquidation distribution | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — treated as disposal proceeds, not dividend] |
| EC-5 | Dividend received via nominee / custodian | Beneficial owner reports income; WHT certificates from custodian required |
| EC-6 | Cum-dividend vs ex-dividend purchase timing | Dividend belongs to registered holder on record date; buyer after ex-date does not receive |
| EC-7 | Excess franking credits (AU) — refund for low-income | Full refund of excess credits if total tax liability < credits |
| EC-8 | Controlled foreign corporation (CFC) deemed dividend | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — income attributed to shareholder regardless of distribution] |
| EC-9 | Dividend paid in foreign currency | Convert at spot rate on payment date; FX gain/loss on subsequent conversion is separate event |
| EC-10 | Dividend waiver (shareholder waives entitlement) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — anti-avoidance may attribute income regardless; HMRC settlements legislation UK] |
