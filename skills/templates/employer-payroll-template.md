## Step 0 — Onboarding questions

Before computing payroll, you MUST obtain:

1. **How many employees?** — headcount and employment types (full-time, part-time, casual)
2. **Pay frequency** — weekly, fortnightly, four-weekly, monthly
3. **Gross salary per employee** — annual or per-period
4. **Tax code / withholding elections** — as issued by tax authority or claimed by employee
5. **Pension scheme details** — enrolled, opted out, contribution rates (employer and employee)
6. **Benefits in kind provided** — company car, health insurance, accommodation, etc.
7. **Student loan deductions?** — [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK Plan 1/2/4/5/PG]
8. **Prior period year-to-date figures** — for cumulative PAYE systems
9. **New starters in period?** — starter declarations, P45/W-4 equivalents
10. **Leavers in period?** — termination date, outstanding pay, notice period

---

## Step 1 — PAYE / income tax withholding computation

### Cumulative system (e.g., UK, ZA)

```
Year-to-date (YTD) gross pay (including this period)
  LESS: YTD personal allowance (annual allowance × months elapsed / 12)
  = YTD taxable pay

Apply tax bands to YTD taxable pay → YTD tax due
  LESS: YTD tax already deducted in prior periods
  = Tax to deduct THIS period
```

### Non-cumulative / per-period system (e.g., US, AU)

```
Gross pay THIS period
  LESS: Per-period allowances (from W-4 or tax file declaration)
  = Taxable pay this period

Apply annualised tax table:
  Taxable pay × pay periods per year = Annualised taxable income
  Look up tax on annualised amount
  Divide annual tax by pay periods = Tax per period
```

### Period tax bands (monthly example)

| Band | Monthly range | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| Tax-free | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] ÷ 12 | 0% |
| Basic rate | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] ÷ 12 | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]% |
| Higher rate | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] ÷ 12 | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]% |
| Additional rate | Above [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] ÷ 12 | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]% |

---

## Step 2 — Social security / national insurance contributions

### Employer contributions

```
Gross earnings in period
  LESS: Earnings threshold [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £175/week UK, $0 US]
  = Earnings subject to employer SSC
  × Employer rate [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC]
  = Employer SSC liability

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Is there an upper earnings limit for employer? — e.g., NO cap UK, YES cap US SS at $168,600]
```

### Employee contributions

```
Gross earnings in period
  LESS: Employee threshold [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £242/week UK primary threshold]
  = Earnings subject to employee SSC

If earnings ≤ [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC upper limit]:
  Employee SSC = Earnings subject × [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC main rate]
If earnings > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC upper limit]:
  Employee SSC = (Upper - Threshold) × main rate + (Earnings - Upper) × reduced rate
```

### SSC rate table

| Component | Threshold | Rate | Cap |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employee main rate | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 8% UK, 6.2% US SS] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Employee reduced rate (above UEL) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 2% UK] | None |
| Employer rate | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 13.8% UK, 6.2% US SS] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Medicare/health (employee) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 1.45% US] | None |
| Medicare/health (employer) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 1.45% US] | None |
| Additional Medicare (high earner) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 0.9% US > $200k] | None |

---

## Step 3 — Pension / retirement contributions

### Auto-enrollment obligations

| Aspect | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Who must be enrolled | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK: age 22–SPA, earning > £10,000/yr] |
| Minimum employer contribution | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 3% UK, 9.5% AU super guarantee] |
| Minimum employee contribution | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 5% UK (of qualifying earnings)] |
| Qualifying earnings band | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £6,240–£50,270 UK] |
| Opt-out window | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 1 month UK] |
| Re-enrollment frequency | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., every 3 years UK] |

### Computation

```
Qualifying earnings = MIN(Gross pay, Upper limit) - Lower limit
Employer contribution = Qualifying earnings × [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC employer %]
Employee contribution = Qualifying earnings × [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC employee %]

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Tax relief method — net pay (deduct before tax) or relief at source (deduct after tax, provider claims basic rate)]
```

## Step 4 — Payslip requirements

### Mandatory payslip items

| Net pay | YES |
| Method of payment | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Cumulative YTD figures (gross, tax, SSC) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — required in cumulative systems] |

## Prohibitions

- NEVER run payroll without a valid tax code or withholding election — use emergency code and flag
- NEVER ignore auto-enrollment obligations — failure to comply is a criminal offence in some jurisdictions
- NEVER classify an employee as a contractor to avoid payroll obligations without applying the employment status test
- NEVER deduct more pension than the employee has agreed to (unless mandatory minimum applies)
- NEVER pay termination amounts without first splitting taxable vs exempt components
- NEVER file late — even one day late attracts penalties in most jurisdictions
- NEVER ignore benefits in kind — unreported BIK is tax evasion
- NEVER apply cumulative YTD figures from a prior employer without their leaving certificate
- NEVER process a salary sacrifice arrangement that takes pay below minimum wage
- NEVER present outputs as tax advice — direct to a qualified tax professional

## Edge Case Registry

| # | Scenario | Correct treatment |
|---|---|---|
| EC-1 | Employee works in two jurisdictions (split payroll) | Apportion based on days worked in each; apply treaty provisions |
| EC-2 | Director with irregular payments | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK: annual earnings period for directors] |
| EC-3 | Employee reaches SSC cap mid-year | Stop deducting employee SSC above cap; employer may continue |
| EC-4 | Salary sacrifice reducing pay below LEL/SSC threshold | SSC savings are legitimate but pension implications must be disclosed |
| EC-5 | Retrospective pay rise (back-dated) | Recalculate YTD on cumulative basis; deduct/refund difference in current period |
| EC-6 | Employee death in service | Final pay to estate; death benefit taxation [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| EC-7 | Expatriate employee (secondment) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — certificate of coverage, treaty relief, shadow payroll] |
| EC-8 | Multiple jobs (employee has other employment) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — secondary tax code, no personal allowance on second job] |
| EC-9 | Attachment of earnings order (garnishment) | Deduct per court order; priority over other non-statutory deductions |
| EC-10 | Furlough / short-time working with government subsidy | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — grant taxable to employer; PAYE on employee's receipt] |

## Test Suite

| # | Input | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| T-1 | Monthly gross £4,000; tax code 1257L (cumulative, month 1); no other deductions | Taxable = £4,000 - £1,047.50 = £2,952.50; tax = £2,952.50 × 20% = £590.50 |
| T-2 | Monthly gross £4,000; employee NIC (UK): earnings £4,000 - PT £1,048 = £2,952; main rate 8% | Employee NIC = £2,952 × 8% = £236.16 |
| T-3 | Employer NIC: earnings £4,000 - ST £758 = £3,242 × 13.8% | Employer NIC = £447.40 |
| T-4 | Auto-enrollment pension (UK): qualifying earnings = £4,000 - £520 = £3,480; employer 3%, employee 5% | Employer = £104.40; Employee = £174.00 |
| T-5 | Termination: £50,000 ex-gratia (UK); first £30,000 exempt | Tax on £20,000 at marginal rate; no NIC on full £50,000 |
| T-6 | Company car BIK (UK): list price £35,000; CO2 emissions → 30% band | Taxable benefit = £35,000 × 30% = £10,500; employer Class 1A = £10,500 × 13.8% = £1,449 |
| T-7 | US biweekly gross $5,000; single, 0 additional allowances; annualized = $130,000 | Federal tax per period = (annualized tax from bracket) ÷ 26 |
