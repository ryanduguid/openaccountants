### Conservative defaults

| Ambiguity | Default |
|---|---|
| Unknown acquisition cost | Zero cost basis (maximises gain) |
| Unknown holding period | Short-term (higher rate) |
| Unknown whether income or capital | Income (higher rate treatment) |
| Unknown fair market value at receipt | Use CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap daily close |
| Unknown cost basis method | FIFO (first in, first out) |
| Airdrop with no clear service performed | Income at FMV on receipt |

---

## Step 0 — Onboarding questions

Before computing, you MUST obtain:

1. **Which digital assets are held?** — BTC, ETH, stablecoins, NFTs, DeFi tokens, etc.
2. **Transaction history source** — exchange CSV exports, on-chain wallet addresses, DeFi protocol records
3. **Acquisition dates and costs** — purchase price per lot in fiat equivalent
4. **Disposal events in the period** — sells, swaps (crypto-to-crypto counts as disposal in most jurisdictions), gifts, payments for goods/services
5. **Mining/staking/yield farming income** — amounts received, FMV at time of receipt
6. **Airdrops and hard forks** — what was received, when, whether any action was required
7. **NFT activity** — minting costs, sales proceeds, royalties received
8. **Cost basis method elected** — FIFO, LIFO, specific identification, average cost (if jurisdiction permits)
9. **Any prior year losses carried forward?**
10. **Personal use asset claim?** — [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC threshold, e.g., AUD $10,000 in Australia]

## Step 1 — Classification: capital asset vs trading income

### Decision tree

```
Was the asset acquired with intention to resell at profit
AND does the taxpayer exhibit badges of trade?
  ├─ YES → Trading income (taxed at marginal income rates)
  │         Indicators: high frequency, short hold periods,
  │         sophistication, leveraged positions, business infrastructure
  └─ NO  → Capital asset (taxed at capital gains rates)
            Indicators: buy-and-hold, long-term investment thesis,
            infrequent disposals, personal portfolio
```

| Factor | Points toward INCOME | Points toward CAPITAL |
|---|---|---|
| Holding period | < [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] days | > [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] days |
| Transaction frequency | > 100 trades/year | < 20 trades/year |
| Use of leverage | Yes | No |
| Source of funds | Borrowed capital | Own savings |
| Taxpayer's profession | Trader / fin services | Unrelated field |
| Organised activity | Dedicated trading setup | Casual app-based |

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Insert classification test — e.g., UK "badges of trade", AU "carrying on a business", US §1221 capital asset definition]

---

## Step 2 — Cost basis methods

| Method | Description | Jurisdictions permitting |
|---|---|---|
| FIFO | First coins acquired are first sold | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| LIFO | Last coins acquired are first sold | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Specific identification | Taxpayer designates which lot sold | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Average cost (pooled) | Weighted average of all acquisitions | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK S104 pool, CA superficial loss rule] |
| Highest-in-first-out (HIFO) | Highest cost lots sold first | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Computation per disposal

```
Proceeds (FMV in fiat at time of disposal)
  LESS: Cost basis of disposed units (per elected method)
  LESS: Transaction fees (gas fees, exchange fees, network fees)
  = Gain or (Loss)
```

Apply [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] holding period test:
- Short-term: held < [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] → taxed at [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RATE]
- Long-term: held ≥ [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] → taxed at [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC RATE]

---

## Step 3 — Taxable events

| Event | Taxable? | Type | FMV basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buy crypto with fiat | No | Acquisition | Record cost basis |
| Sell crypto for fiat | Yes | Disposal — capital gain/loss | Proceeds in fiat |
| Crypto-to-crypto swap | Yes (most jurisdictions) | Disposal + acquisition | FMV of asset received |
| Pay for goods/services with crypto | Yes | Disposal | FMV at time of payment |
| Gift crypto (outbound) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | May trigger CGT | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC rules] |
| Receive crypto as gift | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | May inherit donor's cost basis | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Transfer between own wallets | No | Not a disposal | No change in cost basis |
| Margin/leveraged trading | Yes | Each close is disposal | Settlement amount |
| Liquidation of position | Yes | Forced disposal | Liquidation proceeds |

---

## Step 4 — DeFi-specific treatment

### 4.1 Staking rewards

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Receipt of staking reward | Income at FMV on date of receipt |
| Subsequent disposal of staked reward | Capital gain/loss from FMV cost basis |
| Cost basis of reward | FMV on date received (becomes acquisition cost) |

### 4.2 Lending / yield farming

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Deposit tokens into lending protocol | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — disposal or not?] |
| Receive interest/yield tokens | Income at FMV on receipt |
| Withdrawal from protocol | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — reacquisition?] |
| Impermanent loss (liquidity pools) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — realised on withdrawal?] |

### 4.3 Liquidity pool participation

```
Deposit into LP:
  [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Some jurisdictions treat LP token receipt as a disposal
   of underlying assets; others treat it as a non-event until withdrawal]

LP token receipt → record FMV at deposit
Withdrawal → disposal of LP token, reacquisition of underlying
Difference = gain/loss (includes impermanent loss)
```

### 4.4 Wrapped tokens

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Wrap (e.g., ETH → WETH) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — generally not taxable if 1:1] |
| Unwrap (e.g., WETH → ETH) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — generally not taxable if 1:1] |
| Bridge across chains | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may constitute disposal] |

---

## Step 5 — Mining income

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Hobby mining (occasional, no profit motive) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may be non-taxable until disposal] |
| Business mining (organised, profit-seeking) | Income at FMV on date mined |
| Deductible expenses (business mining) | Electricity, hardware depreciation, cooling, rent |
| Hardware depreciation | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 3-year accelerated US, pooled AU] |
| Cost basis of mined coins | FMV at time of mining (if taxed as income on receipt) |

---

## Step 6 — Airdrops and hard forks

### Airdrops

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Airdrop requiring action (claim, hold threshold) | Income at FMV when received/claimed |
| Unsolicited airdrop (no action required) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — income at receipt or zero cost basis?] |
| Airdrop with zero value at receipt | Zero cost basis; full gain on disposal |

### Hard forks

| Scenario | Treatment |
|---|---|
| New coin received from fork (e.g., BCH from BTC) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Cost basis allocation | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., US: zero basis for new coin; UK: apportion original cost by FMV ratio] |
| Disposal of forked coin | Capital gain from allocated cost basis |

---

## Step 7 — NFT treatment

| Event | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Mint NFT (creator) | No taxable event on creation |
| Sell NFT (creator, primary sale) | Income (if business) or capital gain |
| Buy NFT (collector) | Acquisition — record cost basis |
| Sell NFT (collector) | Capital gain/loss |
| Royalty income (creator, secondary sales) | Income at FMV on receipt |
| NFT swap | Disposal + acquisition (both at FMV) |
| NFT becomes worthless | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — negligible value claim?] |

---

## Step 8 — Wash sale and anti-avoidance rules

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Insert applicable anti-avoidance provisions]

| Rule | Jurisdiction | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Wash sale (30-day) | US (proposed, not enacted for crypto pre-2025) | Loss disallowed if reacquired within 30 days |
| Bed-and-breakfasting (30-day) | UK | Loss disallowed; matched to reacquisition |
| Superficial loss (30-day) | Canada | Loss denied; added to cost of reacquired property |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC rule] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC effect] |

---

## Step 9 — Reporting and record-keeping

### Required records per transaction

- Date and time of transaction (UTC)
- Type (buy/sell/swap/receive/send)
- Asset and quantity
- FMV in local fiat at time of transaction
- Counterparty (exchange, wallet, protocol)
- Transaction hash (on-chain transactions)
- Fees paid (gas, exchange commission)
- Running cost basis per lot

### Reporting obligations

| Form/Schedule | Jurisdiction | Content |
|---|---|---|
| Form 8949 + Schedule D | US | Each disposal: date acquired, date sold, proceeds, cost basis, gain/loss |
| SA108 (Capital Gains) | UK | Summary of crypto gains/losses |
| Schedule 3 | Canada | Each disposition |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC form] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER assume crypto-to-crypto swaps are non-taxable — they are disposals in most jurisdictions
- NEVER use a cost basis method not permitted by the jurisdiction
- NEVER ignore DeFi yield as non-taxable — receipt of value is generally income
- NEVER apply wash sale rules where the jurisdiction has not enacted them for crypto
- NEVER treat transfers between own wallets as disposals
- NEVER advise on tax positions without verifying the taxpayer's classification (trader vs investor)
- NEVER estimate FMV without a verifiable price source (exchange data, oracle, aggregator)
- NEVER ignore gas/network fees — they are part of cost basis or deductible expense
- NEVER assume airdrops are tax-free — most jurisdictions treat them as income on receipt
- NEVER present outputs as tax advice — direct to a qualified tax professional

## Edge Case Registry

| # | Scenario | Correct treatment |
|---|---|---|
| EC-1 | Lost wallet / inaccessible keys | No disposal until formally abandoned; [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC negligible value claim] |
| EC-2 | Theft / hack | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — theft loss deduction? Capital loss?] |
| EC-3 | Exchange bankruptcy (e.g., FTX) | Capital loss when confirmed unrecoverable; timing per [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| EC-4 | Stablecoin depeg | Capital loss on disposal at reduced FMV |
| EC-5 | DAO governance token received for participation | Income at FMV on receipt |
| EC-6 | Play-to-earn gaming rewards | Income at FMV on receipt |
| EC-7 | Cross-chain bridge exploit (funds lost) | Same as theft (EC-2) |
| EC-8 | Token migration (old → new) | Generally not a taxable event if 1:1 swap |
| EC-9 | Margin call / forced liquidation | Disposal at liquidation price |
| EC-10 | Gifting crypto to charity | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — possible deduction at FMV] |

---

## Test Suite

| # | Input | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| T-1 | Buy 1 BTC at $30,000; sell 0.5 BTC at $50,000 (FIFO, held > 1 year) | Gain = (0.5 × $50,000) - (0.5 × $30,000) = $10,000 long-term capital gain |
| T-2 | Swap 2 ETH (cost $3,000 total) for 5,000 USDC | Gain = $5,000 - $3,000 = $2,000 capital gain |
| T-3 | Receive 0.01 ETH staking reward (FMV $25) | Income = $25; cost basis of reward = $25 |
| T-4 | Mine 0.1 BTC (business mining, FMV $4,000); electricity cost $500 | Income = $4,000; deductible expense = $500; cost basis = $4,000 |
| T-5 | Airdrop 1,000 tokens (FMV $0.50 each) requiring claim action | Income = $500; cost basis = $500 |
| T-6 | Transfer 5 ETH from Coinbase to Ledger wallet | Not taxable; no change to cost basis |
| T-7 | Sell NFT minted at cost of 0.1 ETH ($200) for 2 ETH ($4,000) | Gain = $4,000 - $200 = $3,800 |
| T-8 | Provide liquidity (1 ETH + 2000 USDC); withdraw (0.8 ETH + 2200 USDC); ETH FMV at withdrawal = $2500 | Compare withdrawal FMV ($2,000 + $2,200 = $4,200) vs deposit cost basis; gain/loss = difference |
