## Step 0 — Onboarding questions

Before computing, you MUST obtain:

1. **Property details** — address, type (residential/commercial), furnished/unfurnished
2. **Ownership structure** — sole owner, joint tenants, tenants in common (percentage), company-owned, trust
3. **Rental income for the period** — gross rents received or receivable (accruals vs cash basis)
4. **Occupancy dates** — periods let, void periods, personal use days
5. **Mortgage details** — outstanding balance, interest paid in period, lender, buy-to-let or residential mortgage
6. **Expenses incurred** — itemised list with receipts/invoices
7. **Capital expenditure** — any improvements, extensions, renovations in the period
8. **Depreciation schedule** — existing asset register if applicable
9. **Residency status** — resident or non-resident landlord
10. **Other rental properties?** — for loss offset rules and portfolio treatment
11. **Prior year losses carried forward?**

## Step 1 — Gross rental income computation

```
Gross rental income
  = Rent received (or receivable under accruals basis)
  + Premiums for lease grant (if applicable) [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC formula]
  + Service charges recoverable from tenant
  + Insurance claim proceeds (loss of rent policies)
  + Non-refundable deposits retained
  - Irrecoverable rent (bad debts written off) [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC conditions]
```

### Accounting basis

| Basis | Description | Jurisdictions |
|---|---|---|
| Cash basis | Income when received, expenses when paid | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK < £150,000 turnover, US Schedule E] |
| Accruals basis | Income when due, expenses when incurred | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — default for larger landlords] |

---

## Step 2 — Allowable deductions (revenue expenses)

| Category | Examples | Deductible? |
|---|---|---|
| Repairs and maintenance | Fixing boiler, repainting, replacing broken window (like-for-like) | YES |
| Improvements | Extension, loft conversion, new bathroom (upgrading) | NO (capital) |
| Insurance | Buildings insurance, landlord liability, rent guarantee | YES |
| Management fees | Letting agent commissions (typically 8-15% of rent) | YES |
| Legal and professional | Lease renewal fees, accountancy, eviction costs | YES (revenue only) |
| Utilities (landlord-paid) | Council tax (void periods), water rates, electricity | YES (if landlord bears cost) |
| Ground rent and service charges | Leasehold property obligations | YES |
| Advertising | Tenant-finding costs, listing fees | YES |
| Travel | Mileage to property for inspections/maintenance | YES (at [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] rate) |
| Stationery and admin | Phone calls, postage, software (property management) | YES |
| Bad debts | Rent written off as irrecoverable | YES [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC conditions] |
| Finance costs | See Step 3 (may be restricted) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### Repair vs improvement test

| Scenario | Classification |
|---|---|
| Replace broken single-glazed window with single-glazed | Repair (deductible) |
| Replace single-glazed with double-glazed | Improvement (capital) — [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC exceptions] |
| Repaint walls same colour | Repair |
| Replaster then repaint | Repair (restoring to original condition) |
| Add extension | Improvement (capital) |
| Replace entire roof (like-for-like) | Repair |
| Replace kitchen with substantially similar | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — UK: repair; US: improvement] |

---

## Step 3 — Mortgage interest deductibility

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Insert applicable interest restriction regime]

| Regime | Treatment | Jurisdictions |
|---|---|---|
| Full deduction against rental income | 100% of interest deducted from rental profit | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., US Schedule E, AU, NZ pre-2024] |
| Tax credit (basic rate relief only) | Interest not deducted from income; 20% tax credit given | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK s24 restriction since 2020] |
| Disallowed for residential | No deduction for residential rental interest | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., NZ from 2025 for existing properties] |
| Thin capitalisation rules | Interest limited where debt exceeds [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] ratio | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### UK Section 24 computation (example structure)

```
Property profits (before finance costs)          [A]
LESS: 0% of finance costs deductible            [B] = 0
Adjusted profits                                 [A]
Tax at marginal rate on [A]
LESS: 20% tax credit on total finance costs      [C] = finance costs × 20%
Net tax liability = Tax on [A] - [C]
```

---

## Step 4 — Capital allowances / depreciation

[COUNTRY-SPECIFIC: Insert depreciation schedule applicable to rental property]

### Depreciable assets (furnished lettings)

| Asset class | Rate | Method | Jurisdictions |
|---|---|---|---|
| Building structure (residential) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — 2.5% AU, 0% UK, 3.636% US (27.5yr)] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Building structure (commercial) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — 2.5% AU, N/A UK, 2.564% US (39yr)] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Plant and equipment (fixtures, fittings) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — varies by asset] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Furniture and appliances | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 5-7 yr US, div 40 AU] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Carpets and curtains | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 8 yr AU, replacement basis UK] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

### UK replacement of domestic items relief

No wear-and-tear allowance for furnished properties since April 2016. Instead: deduction for cost of replacing furnishings (like-for-like value only; upgrade element is capital).

### Depreciation computation

```
Annual depreciation = (Cost - Residual value) / Useful life    [Straight-line]
Annual depreciation = Written-down value × Rate                 [Declining balance]
```

---

## Step 5 — Furnished vs unfurnished treatment

| Type | Definition | Tax treatment |
|---|---|---|
| Unfurnished | No furniture provided; tenant supplies own | Revenue deductions only; no depreciation on contents |
| Furnished | Substantially furnished (beds, sofas, appliances) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — replacement relief UK, depreciation AU/US] |
| Part-furnished | White goods only (fridge, oven, washing machine) | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — generally treated as unfurnished] |
| Holiday let / short-term | Furnished property let as holiday accommodation | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may qualify for business reliefs, e.g., UK FHL] |

---

## Step 6 — Capital gains tax on disposal

### Computation on sale

```
Disposal proceeds (sale price)
  LESS: Incidental costs of disposal (agent fees, legal, marketing)
  LESS: Acquisition cost (original purchase price)
  LESS: Incidental costs of acquisition (stamp duty, legal, survey)
  LESS: Enhancement expenditure (capital improvements during ownership)
  LESS: [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC indexation or inflation relief]
  = Capital gain before reliefs

  LESS: Annual exempt amount [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £3,000 UK 2024/25]
  LESS: Brought-forward capital losses
  = Taxable capital gain

  × [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC CGT rate for residential property]
  = CGT liability
```

### Reporting deadlines for property disposals

| Jurisdiction | Deadline | Form |
|---|---|---|
| UK | 60 days from completion | CGT property disposal return |
| US | Annual (with return) | Schedule D / Form 8949 |
| [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

---

## Step 7 — Non-resident landlord rules

| Aspect | Treatment |
|---|---|
| Withholding obligation | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 20% UK NRL, 30% US FIRPTA on sale] |
| Who withholds | Letting agent or tenant (if no agent) |
| How to avoid withholding | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., UK HMRC NRL1 application for gross payment] |
| Filing obligation | Non-resident still files self-assessment return |
| Double tax relief | Apply treaty provisions; credit for tax paid in source country |
| Deemed disposal on emigration | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., exit tax provisions] |

---

## Step 8 — Rent-a-room relief and special schemes

| Scheme | Threshold | Effect | Jurisdiction |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rent-a-room | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., £7,500 UK] | Income below threshold tax-free; no deductions claimed | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Micro-entrepreneur | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., €760 FR] | Flat exemption for small rental income | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Principal private residence partial relief | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] | CGT relief for period of own occupation | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| Negative gearing | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., AU allows losses against other income] | Rental loss offsets salary/other income | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |

---

## Step 9 — Record-keeping requirements

### Mandatory records (retain for [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — e.g., 5 years UK, 7 years AU, 3 years US])

- Rental agreements / lease contracts
- Bank statements showing rental receipts
- Mortgage statements showing interest paid
- Invoices and receipts for all deductible expenses
- Asset register with depreciation schedules
- Property purchase completion statement
- Capital improvement invoices
- Letting agent statements
- Insurance policies and premium notices
- Utility bills (if landlord-paid)

---

## Prohibitions

- NEVER deduct capital improvements as revenue repairs — the "repair vs improvement" test must be applied
- NEVER claim mortgage interest deductions where the jurisdiction has restricted or disallowed them
- NEVER ignore non-resident withholding obligations — agents and tenants have statutory duties
- NEVER claim depreciation on land value — only the building and fixtures component
- NEVER apply rent-a-room relief AND claim individual expenses — it is one or the other
- NEVER assume void period expenses are automatically deductible — the property must be available for letting
- NEVER ignore the personal use adjustment where the landlord uses the property privately
- NEVER offset rental losses against other income unless the jurisdiction explicitly permits it
- NEVER present outputs as tax advice — direct to a qualified tax professional

## Edge Case Registry

| # | Scenario | Correct treatment |
|---|---|---|
| EC-1 | Property damaged by tenant; insurance payout exceeds repair cost | Insurance proceeds are rental income; repair cost is deductible expense |
| EC-2 | Void period between tenancies (property actively marketed) | Expenses during void still deductible if property available for let |
| EC-3 | Landlord lives in property part-year, lets remainder | Apportion expenses by time; CGT principal residence relief for occupation period |
| EC-4 | Joint ownership (unequal shares) | Income/expenses split per beneficial ownership percentage, not 50:50 |
| EC-5 | Tenant pays for improvements (tenant's fixtures) | Not landlord's income or expenditure unless retained at end of lease |
| EC-6 | Short-term lets via Airbnb/VRBO | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may be trading income, different loss rules] |
| EC-7 | Below-market rent to family member | [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC — may restrict loss claims; arm's length rules] |
| EC-8 | Property converted from own home to rental | Cost basis = market value at conversion date [COUNTRY-SPECIFIC] |
| EC-9 | Overseas property (foreign rental income) | Taxable in residence country; credit for foreign tax paid |
| EC-10 | Mixed-use property (commercial + residential) | Apportion by floor area or rental value |

## Test Suite

| # | Input | Expected output |
|---|---|---|
| T-1 | Gross rent £12,000; letting agent 10%; repairs £800; insurance £300; mortgage interest £4,000 (UK s24) | Profit = £12,000 - £1,200 - £800 - £300 = £9,700; tax credit = £4,000 × 20% = £800 |
| T-2 | Property purchased £200,000; sold £350,000; legal fees (buy £1,500, sell £2,000); improvements £20,000; AEA £3,000 | Gain = £350,000 - £200,000 - £1,500 - £2,000 - £20,000 - £3,000 = £123,500 |
| T-3 | Rent-a-room income £6,000 (UK threshold £7,500) | Tax-free — below threshold; no return required |
| T-4 | Non-resident landlord; rent £2,000/month; no NRL1 approval | Agent withholds 20% (£400/month); landlord files SA return for credit |
| T-5 | Furnished property; sofa replaced (old cost £600, new cost £1,200, like-for-like value £700) | Deduction = £700 (like-for-like); £500 excess is capital (UK replacement relief) |
| T-6 | Void period 2 months; council tax £300; marketing £150 | Both deductible — property available for let during void |
| T-7 | Joint owners 60/40; gross rent $24,000; total expenses $8,000 | Owner A: income $14,400 less expenses $4,800 = $9,600; Owner B: $9,600 less $3,200 = $6,400 |
