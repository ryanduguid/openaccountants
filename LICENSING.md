# Licensing

OpenAccountants is a **mixed-licence repository**. Two different licences apply,
depending on whether a file is *software* or a *tax Guide*.

## Which licence applies to what

| Files | Licence | Text |
|-------|---------|------|
| Software, tooling, docs, and project metadata — `mcp/`, `scripts/`, `tools/`, `plugins/`, `.claude-plugin/`, `docs/`, `.github/`, `Dockerfile`, and root config/meta files | **AGPL-3.0-only** | [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) / [`LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-only.txt`](LICENSES/AGPL-3.0-only.txt) |
| Tax Guides and their machine-readable exports — `skills/`, `packages/`, `workflows/`, `index.json`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt` | **OA Guide License** (source-available) | [`LICENSES/LicenseRef-OA-Guide-License-1.0.txt`](LICENSES/LicenseRef-OA-Guide-License-1.0.txt) |

The machine-readable exports (`index.json`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`)
reproduce the Guides, so they carry the **Guide License** — otherwise the Guide
content could be taken via the export while ignoring the licence.

This mapping is recorded for tooling in [`REUSE.toml`](REUSE.toml) following the
[REUSE](https://reuse.software) specification.

## What each licence means, in plain terms

**Software (AGPL-3.0-only).** You can use, modify, and self-host the MCP server
and tooling. If you run a modified version as a network service, AGPL requires
you to offer users its source. Commercial use is allowed; a separate commercial
licence is available if AGPL does not fit ([COMMERCIAL-LICENSING.md](COMMERCIAL-LICENSING.md)).

**Guides (OA Guide License).** Free to read, use for your own taxes, use as a
professional reference for client work, quote, teach from, and contribute back.
A **separate commercial licence is required** to embed the Guides in a
commercial AI product, index them for commercial RAG, train models on them,
bulk-extract or redistribute the collection, or run a competing hosted Guide
service. Contact **info@openaccountants.com**.

## Why the repo is no longer "purely" open source

The Guides are the work that took the most effort and are the easiest to lift
wholesale into a proprietary AI product. Keeping the *code* open (AGPL) while
placing the *Guides* under a source-available licence is the deliberate,
supported way to keep the infrastructure open while controlling commercial reuse
of the content. GitHub may therefore report this repository as AGPL-3.0 with
additional/unknown licences — that is expected for a mixed-licence repo.

## Contributions

All contributions are governed by the [Contributor License Agreement](CLA.md),
which grants Glimpse Ltd the right to distribute contributions under **both** the
AGPL and the Guide/commercial tracks. You keep your copyright.

## Third-party copyleft material

Some Guides under `packages/` incorporate third-party material made available
under a copyleft licence (AGPL-3.0 / GPL-3.0), with attribution (see the
`references.md` and provenance sections, e.g. Turkey, France, Poland, Brazil, and
several Canadian provinces). Copyleft material cannot be relicensed: any Guide
that contains or derives from it **remains under its original AGPL/GPL terms**,
notwithstanding the general mapping above. The Guide License applies to the rest
of the Guides, which are Glimpse Ltd's own work, work-for-hire, or covered by an
accepted [CLA](CLA.md).

## Effective date and prior releases

This structure is introduced on **2026-07-16**. Guide versions previously
distributed under AGPL-3.0 remain available under AGPL-3.0 for the copies already
distributed; this change is forward-looking and does not purport to revoke rights
already granted (see § 9 of the Guide License).
