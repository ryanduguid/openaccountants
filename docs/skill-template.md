# Frontmatter spec — the canonical reference

**This section is THE frontmatter spec for every skill/Guide file in this repo.** Other docs (`CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) link here rather than restating it. CI enforces it: `scripts/validate-guides.py` hard-fails on malformed frontmatter, a missing `name`/`description`, a non-integer `tax_year`, a missing or invalid `tier` (must be 1 or 2), a missing or malformed `last_updated` (YYYY-MM-DD), and a missing `jurisdiction` (except in a small allowlist of jurisdiction-agnostic directories, where it warns).

## Required keys

| Key | Format | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `name` | slug, `[country-or-topic]-[domain]` | e.g. `malta-income-tax` |
| `description` | 80-100 words | What it covers, entity types, jurisdiction, tax year, plus trigger phrases the AI should match |
| `jurisdiction` | ISO code | `MT`, `GB`, `DE`, `US`, `US-CA`, `GLOBAL`, `INTL`, `EU-27`. Required even when the folder path implies it |
| `category` | one of the vocabulary below | Domain the skill covers |
| `tax_year` | **bare integer**, e.g. `2025` | The **coverage start year**. Ranges, fiscal calendars, and qualifiers ("2025-26", "YA 2026", "2567 (2024)") go in `tax_year_notes`, never here. CI errors on anything that is not an integer 2015-2035 |
| `tier` | `1` or `2` | `1` = **accountant-reviewed** (a named licensed accountant fully reviewed and signed off); `2` = **source-cited draft** (drafted from primary sources, awaiting review). These are the only two quality states |
| `last_updated` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | Date the content was last checked/edited. It must never move backwards |

## Optional keys

| Key | Format | Notes |
|-----|--------|-------|
| `tax_year_notes` | quoted string | The human-readable tax-year label when a bare year can't express it: `"2025-26"`, `"FY 2026-27 (AY 2027-28)"`, `"2025 (with confirmed 2026 figures noted)"` |
| `verified_by` | `pending` or `Name, Credential` | e.g. `Michael Cutajar, CPA (Malta)`. Stored identifier — the field name stays `verified_by` even though the display language is "reviewed". A real name here implies `tier: 1` |
| `reviewed_by` | `Name, Credential` | Used on the hand-authored `packages/us-federal/` guides (e.g. `Christopher Aryee, CPA`) |
| `depends_on` | YAML list of slugs | Workflow base or country skill this loads on top of |
| `version` | numeric dotted value, e.g. `0.1` | Content version, bumped on substantive change when present. Keep any body-heading version in step |

## Sync integrity rules

`last_updated` and a numeric `version` are monotonic content metadata: an edit
must not decrease either value. A substantive body change should advance the
date, the version, or both, and a heading such as `v1.1` must agree with the
frontmatter version.

These values are not synchronization tokens. The platform exporter must still
compare its stored Git blob hash with the current repository blob before it
rewrites an existing `skills/**` file. See [WEBSITE-SYNC.md](WEBSITE-SYNC.md)
for the fail-closed compare-and-swap contract and pre-push command.

## Category vocabulary (the real one)

This is the vocabulary actually in use across the repo's guides (by count), not an aspirational list. Use these for new files:

| Category | What it means | Approx. usage |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| `international` | Country-level tax computation (income tax, VAT, SSC) | ~757 |
| `foundation` | Universal workflow base (domain-agnostic) | ~198 |
| `orchestrator` | Router / intake / assembly files | ~110 |
| `federal` | US federal tax | ~104 |
| `payroll` | Withholding, social security, payslips | ~82 |
| `tax-optimization` | Legal tax reduction strategies, timing, deductions | ~64 |
| `cross-border` | Multi-jurisdiction coordination, treaties, WHT | ~54 |
| `transfer-pricing` | TP documentation, arm's length, CbCR | ~43 |
| `state-tax` | US state tax | ~40 |
| `formation` | Entity types, registration, compliance | ~39 |
| `financial-statements` | Annual accounts, reporting, audit | ~39 |
| `bookkeeping` | Chart of accounts, P&L, balance sheet | ~39 |
| `invoicing` | E-invoicing format, validation, transmission | ~30 |
| `crypto` | Cryptocurrency and digital asset taxation | ~30 |
| `vertical` | Industry-specific accounting patterns | ~28 |
| `integration` | Platform export formats, column mappings | ~20 |

Legacy synonyms still present in older files — do **not** use for new files: `federal-tax` (use `federal`), `state` / `us-states` (use `state-tax`), `financial-reporting` (use `financial-statements`), plus stragglers `template`, `pattern(s)`, `intelligence`.

# [Skill Name] v0.1

> **General reference only.** This skill is general tax/accounting reference material for AI-assisted workflows. It has not been reviewed for any specific person's facts, documents, elections, deadlines, residency, filing status, or local procedures. Do not rely on it to file, pay, amend, or take a tax position without review by a qualified professional in the relevant jurisdiction.

> **Jurisdiction is required.** Set `jurisdiction:` in frontmatter even when the folder path implies it (e.g. `skills/international/malta/` → still use `jurisdiction: MT`). Sync to openaccountants.com skips files without a resolvable jurisdiction. See [WEBSITE-SYNC.md](WEBSITE-SYNC.md).

## What this file is

**This file is a content skill that loads on top of a workflow base** (e.g. `us-tax-workflow-base`, `crypto-tax-workflow-base`, `bookkeeping-workflow-base`).

[Describe: what it computes, where it fits in the pipeline, what it does NOT cover.
Reference the upstream skills it depends on and the downstream skills that consume its output.]

**Tax year coverage.** This skill is current for **tax year 2025** as of its currency date.

**The reviewer is the customer of this output.** Per the base, this skill assumes a credentialed reviewer reviews and signs the return. The skill produces working papers and a brief, not a return.

- [What forms and schedules]
- [What entity types — sole prop, SMLLC, etc.]
- [What line items or computations]

This skill does NOT cover:

- [What's out of scope — reference which other skills handle it]

---

## Section 2 — Filing requirements

[Who must file, thresholds, deadlines. Cite the state statute or IRC section.]

---

## Section 3 — Rates and thresholds

[All dollar amounts, percentages, phase-outs for the tax year.
Each figure must have a primary source citation.]

| Item | Amount | Source |
|------|--------|--------|

## Section 4 — Computation rules

[Step-by-step computation logic. This is the core of the skill.
Write it so Claude can execute it mechanically.]

### Step 1 — [Name]

[Rule with citation]

### Step 2 — [Name]

[Rule with citation]

---

## Section 5 — Edge cases and special rules

[Unusual situations, exceptions, elections, safe harbors.
Each with a citation.]

---

## Section 6 — Self-checks

Before delivering output, verify:

- [ ] All input figures trace to source documents
- [ ] Rates and thresholds match the tax year
- [ ] Computation follows the steps in Section 4
- [ ] Edge cases from Section 5 are checked
- [ ] Output format matches the base skill spec
