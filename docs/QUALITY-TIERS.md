# OpenAccountants — Skill Quality Tiers

How we measure whether a skill is ready for production use.

We use **two tiers**. No drafts, no stubs — every published skill is one of these:

---

## The two tiers

| Tier | Label | What it means | Badge |
|------|-------|--------------|-------|
| **Accountant-verified** | A licensed practitioner has reviewed the skill, run it against real (or representative) data, and signed off. Errors found during use have been corrected. The skill is current with the latest tax-year rates and filing forms. | `accountant-verified` |
| **Research-verified** | Every rate, threshold, form number, and deadline has been drafted from authoritative sources — tax-authority publications and the relevant statutes. Format matches the accountant-verified standard. Awaiting a credentialed sign-off. | `research-verified` |

That's it. If a skill is published, it is one of those two.

---

## What each tier guarantees

### Accountant-verified

- A real licensed practitioner (CPA, EA, CA, Steuerberater, expert-comptable, commercialista, asesor fiscal, or equivalent for the jurisdiction) has put their name and license number on it.
- The skill has been used against real client data and refined through filing cycles.
- The contributor is publicly credited on the skill and at [openaccountants.com](https://www.openaccountants.com).
- The skill is reviewed at least annually for rate / threshold / form changes.

### Research-verified

- The skill follows the accountant-verified format (Step 0 onboarding → Step N output).
- Every figure carries a primary-source citation (statute, regulation, tax authority notice).
- Deep research against the tax authority's published guidance has been completed.
- It is **not** a substitute for accountant review of an actual filing. The reviewer brief always says so.
- It is the right tier to use *as a starting point* — your accountant reviews and signs off before you file.

## The standard skill format

Every published skill, in either tier, must use this section order:

```
## Skill Metadata                          ← who, what, where
## Confidence Tier Definitions             ← T1 / T2 / T3 rules within the skill
## Step 0: Client Onboarding Questions     ← FIRST — gate before any work
## Step 1: Transaction Classification      ← sale/purchase, location, rate
## Step 2: Box/Line Assignment             ← deterministic lookup tables
## Step 3: Reverse Charge Mechanics        ← cross-border rules
## Step 4: Deductibility Check             ← blocked categories
## Step 5: Derived Calculations            ← computed boxes/totals
## Step 6: Key Thresholds                  ← registration, filing, penalties
## Step 7: Filing Deadlines                ← dates, frequencies
## Step 8: [Country-specific section]      ← e.g., Article 11, Kleinunternehmer
## PROHIBITIONS                            ← hard stops
## Edge Case Registry                      ← numbered EC1, EC2, etc.
## Test Suite                              ← numbered tests with expected output
## Reviewer Escalation Protocol            ← T2/T3 output templates
## Contribution Notes                      ← how to adapt for other jurisdictions
## Disclaimer                              ← standard liability + openaccountants.com
```

Key rules:

- Step 0 (onboarding) is ALWAYS first — never buried at the end.
- Box / line assignments are **deterministic lookup tables**, not narrative text.
- Classification matrices use **tables**, not paragraphs.
- No "Overview" or "What is VAT?" sections — this is an execution skill, not a textbook.
- Every rule tagged with confidence tier `[T1]`, `[T2]`, or `[T3]` (these are *within-skill* rule confidence, not the overall quality tier).
- PROHIBITIONS section comes before edge cases.

This list is auto-derived from each skill's `verified_by` frontmatter by `scripts/build-skills-manifest.py`. To add a new accountant-verified skill, set its `verified_by:` field to the reviewer's name and credential, then re-run the script. Every accountant-verified skill carries the reviewer's name and license number on the skill page at openaccountants.com.

### Research-verified

Everything else in this repo. ~700+ skills covering 134 countries and 51 US states. Each one's frontmatter shows the research date and the authoritative sources cross-checked.

## How a skill moves from research-verified to accountant-verified

1. A credentialed practitioner in the jurisdiction picks up the skill.
2. They review the rates, thresholds, forms, and deadlines against current law.
3. They run the skill against representative or real client data.
4. They submit corrections (web form at openaccountants.com or GitHub PR).
5. A skill maintainer merges the corrections; the skill is tagged with the practitioner's name and license number.
6. The skill is bumped to **accountant-verified** in the next release.

The practitioner is credited publicly. Their profile lists all the skills they've signed off.

## Disclaimer

Quality tiers describe the verification status of a skill, not a guarantee that any specific output is correct. LLMs hallucinate, tax law changes, and individual circumstances vary. Every output must be reviewed by a qualified professional before filing.
